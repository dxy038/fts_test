Background: Immune system disturbances have an important role in endometriosis
which may lead to infertility. It seems that inflammatory cytokines specially tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) which were produced by activated macrophages have an
important role in pathology of endometriosis. Based on this theory, anti TNF-a drugs
like pentoxifylline (PX) are suggested as new drugs for Endometriosis.
Objective: This experimental study has been done on female rats to determine the
effect of PX on the endometrial implants and leukocytes in serum.
Material and Methods: In proestrous phase, one hom of rat's bicom uterus was
removed surgically and the endometrium was implanted to different places as follows:
subcutaneous, peritoneum and near ovaries. After two months observation, female rats
divided into two groups randomly. In treated group (n=lO) PX (5mglkg twice a day)
and in control group (n=10), normal saline (same dose) were injected subcutaneously.
Then, via second laparotomy and in the same phase of the cycles, the size of implants
and the amount of leukocytes in serum were measured.
Results: In treated group compared with control, the size of implants was decreased
significantly in right subcutaneous (8.05mm vs 13.5Omm) p<O.OI, left subcutaneous
(7.64 mm vs 14mm) p<O.OI, right ovary (6.64 mm vs 15.22mm) p<O.OOI and left ovary
(7.18 mm vs 14.56 mm) p<0.005. In treated group, the total leukocyte count (5259.54 ±
178.78 vs 15833.33 ± 259.27) p<0.02 was decreased. The number of esterous cycle
was similar in both groups .
Conclusion: PX can reduce the size of endometrial implants as well as leukocyte count.

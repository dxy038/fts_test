Nowadays, world demand for fossil fuels is rapidly growing which will certainly involve total exhaustion of reserves in the next coming years. In addition, these energies are polluting and are causing climate change currently lived. In the other hand, renewable energy sources are clean, safe and inexhaustible. It has now become essential to develop and promote this type of energy. In this objective that we have realized a domestic synchronous wind turbine. In this work, we describe the different components of the wind turbine (blades, generator, rectifier, support, tower, ...). All components are manufactured manually. The generator is based on neodymium permanent magnets. The estimated power of the wind turbine is 700W/h.

Objective: Our purpose was to investigate intrauterine insemination pregnancy rates after human spermatozoa exposure to platelet-activating factor. Study Design: Spermatozoa were incubated with platelet-activating factor in sperm-washing medium before intrauterine insemination. Patients whose sperm were incubated with sperm-washing medium alone served as controls. Pregnancy outcome was determined by ultrasonography (fetal heartbeat). Results: Patients whose sperm were treated with exogenous platelet-activating factor had a significantly (P< .05) higher pregnancy rate (40%) than patients (20%) not receiving treatment. Conclusion: Inclusion of platelet-activating factor into a semen processing protocol, before intrauterine insemination, will significantly improve pregnancy rates. Platelet-activating factor may have a stimulatory effect on centriole-intact spermatozoa, enhancing their motility and fertilization success and resulting in improved pregnancy rates. Additional studies will elucidate the reproductive significance of platelet-activating factor activity in spermatozoa and its role in the establishment of pregnancy.

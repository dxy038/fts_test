A new methodology for aircraft HVDC power systems design is first proposed. The first goal is to design the network subsystems in order to obtain optimal devices from a weight point of view. The contribution of optimal linear multivariable control methods is shown to be major for this first design objective and H<sub>infin</sub> synthesis is applied in this paper. The second design objective is that the devices exhibit an adequate dynamical behavior when integrated into the DC network. But during design phases, the aircraft subsystems providers generally do not know the parameters of the DC network. To guarantee an easy integration of the subsystems, the device design should be robust to DC network uncertainties. Robust performance analysis method is applied in this paper and is integrated in the proposed methodology.

This paper introduces the study of a single phase bidirectional high frequency link inverter for photovoltaic application in grid tie system, based in the Push-Pull topology. The main advantages of high frequency link inverters are: the low cost and high power density of the transformers, and the capacity to provide galvanic isolation between the photovoltaic panels and the grid. Furthermore, the capability to manage bidirectional power flow from the electric grid to the dc source allows add the capability to compensate reactive power in the system using the same circuit. Proper operation of the proposed system has been validated through simulation results, showing that the injection of photovoltaic power to the mains and reactive power compensation are carry out at the same time.

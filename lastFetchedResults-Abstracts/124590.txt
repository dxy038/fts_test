Introduction: Considering the high prevalence of Tricomonas vaginalis (TV) in women and the known side effects of Metronidazol, the focus has been concentrated on herbal therapy in order to reduce drug side- effects in the recent decades.
Objective: To determine of M.communis effect on Trichmonas VaginaIis infection.
Materials and Methods: This study has been carried out as double blind in test and control groups. Methanolic extraction was performed by percolation and essential oil prepared by hydrodistillation. The parasite was isolated from vagina and determined directly. Samples were collected from vaginal discharges. Identification were done
through direct smear preparation. Parasite was added to the 5 test tubes containing Drosse medium, metronidazole, Dimethyl sulfoxaide (DMSO) myrtus extraction with concentration of (0.1, 0.01 ml and essential oil with concentrations of (0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.004, 0.0002 and 0.0001) in order to determine the effect of these concentrations within 72 hours.
Results: Findings suggested that Trichomonas could be alive in Drosse medium for 72 hours, in presence of Metronidazole for one hour and in Drosse medium for 6 hours. Also, the results revealed that methanolic extract at concentrations of 0.1 and 0,01 and essential oil at concentrations of 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0004 were effective at the beginning of the inoculation and at concentrations of 0.0002 and 0.0001 after 2 and 9 hours respectively. Conclusion: Considering the significant effect of essential oil and methanolic extract of M.communis on Trichomonas in-vitro condition, it is recommended that the therapeutic effects of the substance from this plant be studied in- vitro condition and if having positive effect, to be used as a drug.

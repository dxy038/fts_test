This paper describes a speech coder which exploits the combination of subband splitting, adaptive predictive coding, vector quantization and dynamic bit allocation in order to yield very good quality at 16 kbit/s. The coder has been evaluated by means of objective measures and informal listening tests. Some experiments have also been conducted with input signals degraded by acoustic background noise. Results confirm that the proposed coder is a viable approach for such applications as end-to-end transmission circuits, digital mobile radio and voice mail systems.

Background. Of all aortic operations, thoracoabdominal aortic repairs have the highest risk of spinal cord neurologic injury, manifest by lower limb paraplegia or paraparesis. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage combined with intrathecal papaverine (CSFDr + IP) may reduce the risk and severity of neurologic injury. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of CSFDr + IP to prevent neurologic injury after high-risk thoracoabdominal aneurysm repairs.

Methods. We screened 64 patients before operation with descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aneurysms for possible inclusion in a prospective, randomized study. Thirty-three patients with high-risk type I and II thoracoabdominal aneurysms met inclusion criteria and 17 were randomly assigned to CSFDr + IP and 16 to the control group. The study was terminated early after interim analysis revealed a significant difference.

Results. Of 64 patients screened, 2 patients died after operation (3.1%, 2/64); both were in the randomized study (6%, 2/33), and neither had a neurologic injury. Neurologic injury developed in 2 CSFDr + IP patients and 7 control patients (p = 0.0392). Control patients also had lower postoperative motor strength scores (p = 0.0340). On multivariate analysis, risk factors for neurologic injury included (p < 0.05) longer cross-clamp time, failure to actively cool with bypass, and postoperative hypotension, whereas CSFDr + IP was protective. Logistic regression showed that CSFDr + IP and active cooling significantly reduced the risk of injury and that the two combined modalities were additive. Of 64 patients screened, only 2 (3%) had a permanent neurologic deficit preventing ambulation.

Conclusions. For high-risk thoracoabdominal aneurysms, CSFDr + IP was effective in reducing the incidence and severity of neurologic injury. Active cooling may be further additive to CSFDr + IP protection, although this needs to be confirmed in a larger study.

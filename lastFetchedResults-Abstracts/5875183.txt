The Named Data Networking (NDN) is proposed recently as a promising paradigm for the future Internet due to its built-in caching and name-based routing for efficient content distribution. For the time being, the research on NDN caching is still a preliminary topic, especially for the scenario of an ISP with multiple gateways. For more in-depth excavation, we have studied the effective intra-ISP caching under multiple gateways and multi-path routing in this paper. With the primary objective of reducing the inter-ISP traffic, we develop a popularity-based coordinated caching strategy named the Effective Multipath Caching scheme (EMC), which substantially saves more than 50% inter-ISP traffic and more than 30% content access latency. Through evaluation, we observe that EMC significantly outperforms the widely used Leaving Copies Everywhere (LCE) scheme and Leaving Copies with Probability (LCProb) scheme in terms of reducing both the inter-ISP traffic as well as the content access latency. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed caching scheme is effective, scalable and light-weight.

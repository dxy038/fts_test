This paper proposes a methodology that uses automatic speaker recognition for evaluating the speaker recognizability of processed speech. This methodology provides an efficient measure (an objective one) that is hoped to replace subjective tests which involve human listeners. Preliminary experiments have been conducted using speech processed through the following coders: LPC-10 2400 bps (FS 1015), CELP 4800 bps (FS 1016), and PSELP 2400 pbs

Specialized networking protocol can be adapted for special requirements, which arise for cluster or distributed systems. So, such systems should use a protocol that is to satisfy needs of arbitrary tasks, which need support of rapid messages interchange and which, can start heavy computations as a reaction for message receipt. The objective is to implement an efficient data transfer protocol that needs to satisfy the fast and reliability of networking requirements the way in which this will be implemented based on the technology of Winsock using Visual C++ programming language.

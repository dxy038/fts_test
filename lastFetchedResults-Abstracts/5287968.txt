The digital aeronautical information management (D-AIM) project is a joint EUROCONTROL and LFV project running from 2007 to 2009. The objective of D-AIM is to create a test-bed for one of the foundations of future ATM, which is information sharing. To reach this objective aeronautical information shall be available digitally. Additionally, information should be integrated, by removing barriers between static and dynamic data and enabling data fusion from multiple sources. This requires standardized data exchange formats and interfaces, ready to be used by the next intended user (system) - airborne as well as ground based. D-AIM aims to establish an overall environment for sharing the required information. This paper describes the findings of the first phase of the D-AIM trials. This first phase encompasses the set-up and installation of the D-AIM system and equipment in small scale and also include verification of functionality and the first validation of the use cases addressed in the trials. The paper includes the experiences and findings up until March 2009.

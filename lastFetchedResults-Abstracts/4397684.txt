CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine tools are devices of high precision milling largely employed due to their high precision and to allow simultaneous positioning and velocity control of each machineÂ´s axis. The main objective of this paper is to develop a virtual environment to realize a comparative study between two types of actuation systems (stepper motor and DC motor) focusing on implementation complexity and on the final result quality of each alternative.

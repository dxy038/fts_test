Small cells have been regarded as an appealing technique to boost resource reuse ratio. On the other hand, their large-scale and self-organised tendency would complicate the interference environment of mobile networks. Meanwhile, traffic class is booming in recent years, which leads to higher demand for network designers on Quality of Service (QoS) provision, and therefore usersÂ´ diverse requirements may not be guaranteed in such an interference limited scenario. To maximise the number of users with QoS demands as well as resource reuse ratio, we formulate the resource allocation problem into a multi-objective l<sub>0</sub> norm form. It is shown to be NP hard, and an iterative method is employed to approach the optimal solution. Because of its limit of being not adaptive to large-scale networks, we also design a heuristic method based on chordal graph, which, however, could result in performance loss when the size of networks is small. Finally, by combining these two methods, we devise a hybrid algorithm such that the allocation performs both efficiently and effectively. Simulation results illustrate the performance of our proposed methods in terms of outage probability and resource reuse ratio.

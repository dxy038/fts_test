In this paper, the new German energy policy is analyzed. The main objective of this analysis is to find an answer to the question mentioned in the title of the paper by conducting a multidimensional investigation concerning the sustainability of the current energy policy of the German government. This document also contains information about the evolution of the previously released energy policies of Germany, the reason why the Government has decided about the so called Energiewende (energy turn), however this paper is especially devoted to examine the short- and long-term consequences of this political declaration. The reflections are principally based on statistics, relevant German laws, regulations, decisions and directives of the European Union. What is undoubtedly foreseeable that Germany has started a demanding but at the same time challenging struggle and if they win, their resounding triumph will set for the others an example to follow.

In the multiview video plus depth (MVD) representation for 3D video, a depth map sequence is coded for each view. In the decoding end, a view synthesis algorithm is used to generate virtual views from depth map sequences. Many of the known view synthesis algorithms introduce rendering artifacts especially at object boundaries. In this paper, a depth-level-adaptive view synthesis algorithm is presented to reduce the amount of artifacts and to improve the quality of the synthesized images. The proposed algorithm introduces awareness of the depth level so that no pixel value in the synthesized image is derived from pixels of more than one depth level. Improvements on objective quality of the synthesized views were achieved in five out of eight test cases, while the subjective quality of the proposed method was similar to or better than that of the view synthesis method used by Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG).

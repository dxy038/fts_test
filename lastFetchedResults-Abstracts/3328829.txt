This paper presents a simulation of an electric vehicle propulsion system. The simulation assumes BLDC motors combined with a proportional-integral controller and batteries. Regarding the longitudinal dynamics of electric vehicles (EV), models of different components and configurations are introduced and simulated. The simulations show the potential of each configuration according to the battery size. Thus, the objective is to find the best configuration (batteries size and propulsion system setup), keeping the original drivability. Six different configurations will be analyzed using the standard Brazilian urban driving cycle NBR6601. A rule-based method is used in the power management strategy that indicates the batteries states. This information aids the decision on the correct specification of the battery for each simulated configuration according to some restrictions.

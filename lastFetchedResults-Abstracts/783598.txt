Background The mental health of university
students is an area of increasing concern
worldwide. The objective of this study is to examine the
prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among a
group of Turkish university students. Methods Depression
Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-42) completed
anonymously in the studentsâ€™ respective classrooms by
1,617 students. Results Depression, anxiety and stress
levels of moderate severity or above were found in 27.1,
47.1 and 27% of our respondents, respectively. Anxiety
and stress scores were higher among female students.
First- and second-year students had higher depression,
anxiety and stress scores than the others. Students who
were satisfied with their education had lower depression,
anxiety and stress scores than those who were not
satisfied. Conclusions The high prevalence of depression,
anxiety and stress symptoms among university
students is alarming. This shows the need for primary
and secondary prevention measures, with the development
of adequate and appropriate support services
for this group.

The intent of this presentation is to unravel the details of influence of parasitic components in power converter operation, via a comprehensive analysis of operation equations of the circuit and their solving using specific software. The conclusions of the paper allow an objective evaluation of advantages of simulation based on operation equations versus the circuit-oriented simulators in the study of power converters.

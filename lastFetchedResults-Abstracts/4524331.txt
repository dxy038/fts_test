Continuous Data Protection (CDP) Technology, according to capturing and storing all the changed data, it has implemented to restore data at any history moment before a damage. As the technology Recovery Point Objective (RPO) can be reduced to the lowest limitation, the key issues of which turns into recovery time objective (RTO). Upon the traditional backup and recovery strategy of the new data, itÂ´s proposed an increment-based method that makes backup and recovery as block map, effectively eliminate the redundant read and write operations in the process of data recovery, improve the efficiency of data recovery and reduce the recovery time. It also presents the architecture of Continuous Data Protection system which has achieved by the above-mentioned strategy in the paper.

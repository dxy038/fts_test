Pixels represent picture elements and it is the smallest unit of picture information that is stored as bits to form a digital image. In general, more bits stored per pixel will result in clearer image due to higher greyscale or colour resolution in the image, and the more pixels used to represent an image, the closer the image resembles the original. In imaging science, the analysis, manipulation, storage, and display of pixel information from sources as photographs, drawings, and video refers to image processing. Output of the image processing is an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image. Studies at the Centre for Signal &amp; Imaging Research (CISIR) focus on these characteristics and parameters in the area of surface imaging, optical imaging and functional imaging for early detection and monitoring of various medical health problems. Subjective assessment is replaced with objective assessment based on engineering measurements with given accuracy and precision. For example, Diabetic Retinopathy monitoring and grading using measurements of 2D surface imaging, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) monitoring system using data points of 3D surface imaging techniques, Pigmentation disorder (PD) such as vitiligo and melasma assessment, and skin modelling using optical imaging. Outcomes from such translational research have already been tested at hospitals in Malaysia to help clinicians in diagnosis and monitoring several diseases that can lead to betterment the treatment process in early stages of such disease.

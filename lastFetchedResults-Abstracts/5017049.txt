High-performance FPGA accelerating software applications are a growing demand in fields as communications, image processing, and scientific computing among others. Moreover, as the cost per gate of FPGAs declines, embedded and high-performance systems designers are being presented with new opportunities for creating accelerated software applications using FPGA-based programmable hardware platforms. Powerful high-level language to RTL generators are now emerging. One of the promises of these tools is to allow software and systems engineers to implement algorithms quickly in a familiar language and target the design to a programmable device. The generators available today support syntaxes with different degrees of fidelity to the original language. This paper focuses on the efficient use of C to RTL generators that have a high degree of fidelity to the original C language. The objective of this project is to study some tools that starting from languages of high level as ANSI-C, and generate FPGA accelerating software applications automatically. In this paper are presented tools and partial results of the hardware generated by them

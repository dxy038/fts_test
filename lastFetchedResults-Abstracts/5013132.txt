Summary form only given. The objective of DARPAÂ´s ABCS (Antimonide Based Compound Semiconductors) Program is to demonstrate low power dissipation, high frequency integrated circuits (up to 5000 components per chip) exploiting the high mobility and small bandgaps of 6.1 &#197; semiconductors. This talk will present an overview of the program and then discuss some exciting new results.

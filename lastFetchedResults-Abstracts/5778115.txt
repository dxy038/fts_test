In this, primary objective of the ability of wheelchairs has been improved by using a solar energy system, enhanced converter and employing brushless (BLDC) motor to drive wheelchair. An intelligent speed controller based on fuzzy logic was developed to increase comfort of disabled people. In addition, an accelerometer was used to measure acceleration, which is directly related to passenger ease. All these improvements were implemented by means of a MSP430F5438 microcontroller due to its low cost and better-quality performance. A prototype solar tracking array fitted with photovoltaic panels it to utilize adjust solar collecting positions dynamically to attain maximum power collection.

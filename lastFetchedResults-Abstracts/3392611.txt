This paper presents a method for optimization with respect to bandwidth efficiency for a binary transversal filter when the input pulse format is NRZ. The objective is to concentrate as much as possible of the energy in the emitted signal within certain frequency bands. The filter coefficients are given by a symmetric eigenvector for a Toeplitz matrix, and the corresponding eigenvalue equals the optimum value.

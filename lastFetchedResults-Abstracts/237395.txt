The spread of composted municipal waste (CMW) on land can be used for sustainable crop production. Nevertheless, heavy metals availability may be a problem. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the impact of CMW disposal on heavy metal accumulation in soil and plants. The treatments consisted of an untreated plot (control) and four rates of CMW application. All plots were cultivated in succession of carrot, cauliflower, sweet corn, and radish. Cu and Pb significantly accumulated in the topsoil (0–5 cm) with a similar pattern in the depths of 5–10 cm and 10–20 cm. Cauliflower, for Fe and Cu, and radish, for Pb and Cu, had their tissue analysis significantly affected due to the increasing rates of application of CMW. Nevertheless, the levels of accumulation in both, soil and plant, are within permissible limits. The evidences provided by this experiment indicated that heavy metals are less likely to cause problems for the estimation of CMW loadings to Brazilian agricultural land.

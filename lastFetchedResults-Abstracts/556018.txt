Background and Objective: Appetite control affects food intake and obesity. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of moderate and heavy resistance exercise on appetite, food intake and energy expenditure in healthy men.Materials and Methods: A cross-over research design was used and the study was performed on a population of 13 male volunteers from employees of Sabzevar University in 3 group containing control, moderate resistance exercise (70-75% of one repetition maximum) and heavy resistance exercise (80-85% of one repetition maximum) groups within 90 minutes and including 8 types of movement with 3 sets and 10 repetition. The food given to men before and on the day of the exercises was similar. The appetite was recorded by appetite questionnaire and norm (VAS) before, immediately after exercise, and 3 and 9 hours after the exercise protocol. Food intake and energy expenditure was recorded by food intake and energy expenditure questionnaire before and on the day of the exercises. Data was analyzed using repeated measure ANOVA with a significant level of p<0.05.Results: Having the results collected, there were no significant changes in appetite and in the effects of moderate and heavy resistance exercise. Calorie intake showed an increase on protocol day rather than the previous day of protocol and immediately after protocol day returned to level of previous day of protocol. Energy expenditure showed an increase on protocol day rather than th^ previous day of protocol and immediately after protocol day in resistance exercise groups.Conclusion: The results of the study indicate that one session moderate and heavy resistance exercise had no significant effects on appetite due to imbalance in significant negative energy and due increase energy expenditure on protocol day rather than the previous day of protocol.

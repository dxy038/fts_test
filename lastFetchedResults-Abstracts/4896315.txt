This paper deals with the analysis of fuzzy control systems. The main objective is to study the effect of parameter modifications in the closed loop dynamic behaviour. Particularly, the stability analysis against changes in parameters has a main interest for practical implementations. The paper uses stability indices previously developed by the authors to quantify the stability and robustness of fuzzy control systems. Both the stability around an equilibrium point and global stability are considered. The analysis is carried out by means of statistical methods. In this paper we propose the application of statistics for the analysis of fuzzy control systems. The approach is illustrated by considering the results of the application to the control of an inverted pendulum

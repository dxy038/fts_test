The objective is to provide a useful comparison of several popular eigenspace source localization approaches. Specifically, the authors compare spectral, rooting and ESPRIT methods. For this comparison direction of arrival (DOA) estimation with a uniform linear array is considered. The consideration is limited to resolution, and DOA estimate variance and bias. Since resolvability is a principal interest, resolution enhancements are addressed. The algorithms are described. The comparison is based on Monte Carlo simulation

An oscillation-based built-in self-test (BIST) method is presented for functional testing of mixed signal devices. An integral component of this method of on-chip testing involves transforming a static analog signal into a digital clock-like signal. This paper focuses on comparing the results of various analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) used to evaluate the functional integrity of a biosensor. The objective of this research is to determine key metrology infrastructure issues needed for developing the design reuse approach for multi-technology System-on-a-Chip (SoC) devices

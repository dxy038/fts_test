This paper explains how it was implemented a method of visual data mining deals to maximize the advantages provided by the use of a distributed object over a video wall, to facilitate the assessment of large amounts of data. It is seeking an alternative to the growing problem of having information and wanting to learn something from it so that they can minimize the costs in time and covers transportation, processing and visualization. ThatÂ´s why we have selected the fundamental techniques in the process of mining as the coefficient of Pearson, and part of the management of distributed object has opted to use the advantages of the Mac platform. The main objective of this project is to create a system that allows for a friendly display large amounts of data.

New applications and systems in power automation will necessitate a redesign of the communication infrastructure as well as mapping to new technologies and protocols in communication and security. The result is a data communications network integrated with the power grid that collects, aggregates, and analyzes power transmission, distribution and consumption data that is captured in near real-time. At the same time, automation and control reach into all subdomains and raise the bar for performance and reliability. It is essential to capture and analyze the requirements in detail in order to define a protocol stack and a network and security architecture for the target domain and the underlying use cases. In order to accelerate grid modernization efforts at scale, standards are needed to pick up the protocol stack and system definitions with the objective to achieve interoperability between devices and systems from different vendors.

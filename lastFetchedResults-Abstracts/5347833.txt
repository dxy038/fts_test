A developed version of generalized differential evolution, GDE3, is proposed. GDE3 is an extension of differential evolution (DE) for global optimization with an arbitrary number of objectives and constraints. In the case of a problem with a single objective and without constraints GDE3 falls back to the original DE. GDE3 improves earlier GDE versions in the case of multi-objective problems by giving a better distributed solution. Performance of GDE3 is demonstrated with a set of test problems and the results are compared with other methods

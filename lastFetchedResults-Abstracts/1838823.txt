We report a new case of renal cell carcinoma with the translocation (X;1)(p11;q21) and complex structural rearrangements in a female patient of 64 years of age. We analyzed abnormalities using FISH to identify chromosomal rearrangements, and wonder whether the translocation (X;1) could represent a particular subentity in renal cell carcinoma with distinct histologic features.

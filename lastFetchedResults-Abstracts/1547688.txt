	In this paper, multi-objective Genetic Algorithm has been employed to find the communications satellite optimal transfer trajectory from geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) to geosynchronous orbit (GEO) as the destination operational zone. Because of satellite high specific impulse, Orbital maneuvers are considered as impulsive maneuvers in this paper and number of intermediate orbits has been found in order to physical constraints. In this systematic approach, both minimum-time and fuel-saving using constant acceleration simultaneously as the problem strategy to find the optimal transfer trajectory between two orbits. Set of optimal trajectories are plotted in Pareto Front and transfer trajectory can be selected from these points. Finally, the results are compared with the results obtained using STK software and good agreement has been revealed.

According to the characteristics of the contingency management for third logistics party supplier (3PLS), the main objective of this paper is to construct a methodology to select contingent plan. We propose a multi-perspective framework based on the quality function deployment (QFD), which is able to take into the voices of the third party logistics supplier, its customers and partners account. Furthermore, we found the decision procedure of the multi-perspective framework by applying fuzzy theory and the group decision-making theory to improve the basic QFD. Lastly, a numerical example is illustrated to address the feasibility and effectiveness of this methodology for 3PLS to select the best contingent plan. This research will bring up some new insights for the risk and contingent management in the logistics fields.

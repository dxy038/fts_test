Introduction: Breast milk is the best nutrition for infants. Although feeding mostly begins with breast milk but its continuation is ignored in some cases. In this regard, identification of related factors to breastfeeding is important. 
Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine related factors to continuing breastfeeding in hospitalized infants.
Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 470 mothers of infants younger than 2 years referring to 17-Shahrivar medical-educational hospital in Rasht. Data were collected during a four months period from September to December of 2012. Data collection tool included a questionnaire consisting of three parts. First and second parts included mother and child's socio-demographic information and related factors to breastfeeding continuation which were researcher made, and third part covered related factors influencing continuation of breastfeeding and mother’s attitude toward breastfeeding. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (Mean, SD) and analytical statistics (Chi-square, Fisher test and ANOVA). Multiple logistic regression was applied to estimate effect factors and relative chance.
Results: Findings showed that most mothers (57.6%) continued breastfeeding even after six months but unfortunately 42.4% breastfeed for less than six months. Mothers who continued breastfeeding after six months, results showed a significant relationship between length of breastfeeding and premature newborn (P < 0.003), mother’s employment (P < 0.014), insufficient breastfeeding (P < 0.0001), newborns’ refusal to breastfeeding, consuming contraceptive pills (P < 0.0001) and mother’s attitude about breastfeeding (P < 0.008).  
Conclusion: Results show that the most important factors related to incontinous breastfeeding are related to mothers' misbelief regarding signs of adequacy of breast milk and consumption of oral contraceptives.

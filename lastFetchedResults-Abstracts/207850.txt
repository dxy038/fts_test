The attraction of foreign direct investment (FOIl and its relevant effect on international trade has been
generally one of important issues in the literature. FDI causes an increase in production capacities and
meanwhile it plays a crucial role in constructing linkage between economies worldwide throughout export
market expansion, spillovers and technology transformation. The objective of this research is thus to
examine the effects of FOI inflows on foreign trade of host countries. A trade model is specified and
estimated by using panel data of 24 seJected Asian-Pacific countries, (which includes 12 East Asia-Pacific
countries and 12 countries from the West Asia), in the period of 1980-2005. Empirical results indicate that
FDI affects significantly and positively all considered countries' imports and exports, overall, while the
impact is more pronounced in the East Asia-Pacific than that in the West Asia region. Hence, the implication
is that developing countries like Iran should facilitate and increase FDI inflows to achieve more developed
technology and financing.

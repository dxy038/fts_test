This paper presents the computed results of electric and magnetic fields generated by the near by lightning. The electric and magnetic fields have been computed for different heights ranging from 10 m to 2 km above the ground and for the lateral distances varying from 20 m to 2 km from the lightning return stroke. For airborne vehicles e.g. satellite launch vehicles, missiles etc, it has become necessary to understand the behavior of these when illuminated by a strong electromagnetic fields generated by a near by lightning. The coupling of these fields with the above system could be by means of the leakage of the transient electromagnetic fields through the joints of the vehicles, leakage through the improperly shielded cables, leaks through the edges of closed doors etc. This results the generation of transient voltages and currents with the internal circuitry of such systems. The objective of this work is to compute the fields along the airborne vehicles when excited by plane electromagnetic fields. These plane electromagnetic fields consist of electric and magnetic fields, where the fields could get modified at different heights from the ground plane and for different distances from the lightning channel.

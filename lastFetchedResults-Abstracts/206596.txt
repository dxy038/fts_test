The silkworm bombyx mod L. is a monophagous insect from lepidoptera order that eats only morus alba leaves.
Silkworm produce silk, that is the longest natural fibers in the world.
The silk fibers is spinned end of larval period and highly would be effected by environmental conditions, chemical materials and their concentration.
The objective of this study, as the evaluation of biological, Particularly Nuclear polyhedrosis virus,(NPV) effects on different silkworm genitical components.
The reason that NPV selected as a biological pollutant was due to wide effects of this virus on silkworm mortality at different stages of this insect including larval and pupal stages.
This study was carried out under RCD Mthods by 9 various silkworm genitical components, and 5 replication include 110 4th instar larvae for NPV and control treatment.
The results was processed by under IRRI stat and execell softwares:
The effect of NPV during treatment stages is independent of any kinds of genitical components and it can be shown by a mathematical model by max and min curve during peak mortality and normal Period of disease in populations.
The evaluation of the effects of pollutants shows that the varieties (m 1-1 * 103) * (104 * 110) and (107 * 110 and (103 * m 1-1) * (104 * 110) are more resistant than the others.
The variety xinhang 3 * koming2 with the most mortality shows the least resiotance to the pollutants.

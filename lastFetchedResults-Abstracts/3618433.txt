The paper presents a new reactive-power-compensation scheme for the Jeju-Haenam HVDC system. Owing to changes in the Jeju AC power-system configuration since the Jeju-Haenam HVDC system was constructed, there is an increasing need to modify the existing reactive-power-compensation scheme. In the paper, a new reactive compensation scheme for the stable operation of the HVDC system has been proposed using integer programming to take into account the reactive power supply from new thermal power plants for the Jeju AC power system. An additional objective of the new compensation scheme to minimise the number of components switching in order to reduce temporary overvoltage. Nonlinear time-domain simulations using PSS/E and PSCAD/EMTDC were used to verify the proposed scheme.

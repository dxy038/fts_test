A simplified multi-objective optimization model for optimal allocation of water resources in Baojixia up-tableland irrigation district was established based on the ecological basic flow of Weihe River aiming at the problems that water resource is insufficient and the ecological basic flow is hard to guarantee in Weihe River watershed. Then the model was solved according to the actual situation of river runoff in Linjiacun and water supply and irrigation demand in the irrigation district. The results showed that monthly irrigation water demand and ecological basic flow in the normal year could be guaranteed in the whole year by optimizing the allocation of water resources under the current irrigation technical conditions. The monthly guarantee rate of irrigation water during the non-flood season in the dry year could be up to 80% when the monthly ecological basic flow rate was not less than 50%. The results showed that both the guarantee rates of the ecological basic flow of Weihe River and the irrigation water were different in different hydrologic years in the current condition of water-saving techniques.

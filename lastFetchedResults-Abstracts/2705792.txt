Recent targeted attacks and natural disasters have made disaster-resilient cloud network design an important issue. Network operators are investigating proactive and reactive measures to prevent huge data loss and service disruptions in case of a disaster. We present novel techniques for disaster-aware datacenter placement and content management in cloud networks that can mitigate such loss by avoiding placement in given disaster-vulnerable locations. We first solve a static disaster-aware datacenter and content placement problem by adopting an integer linear program with the objective to minimize risk, defined as expected loss of content. It is a measure of how much, in terms of cost or penalty, a network operator may lose probabilistically due to possible disasters in a cloud network. We also show how a service providerÂ´s budget constraint can affect disaster-aware placement design. Since disaster scenarios, content popularity, and/or importance are always changing in time, content placement should rapidly adapt to these changes. We propose a disaster-aware dynamic content-management algorithm that can adjust the existing placement based on dynamic settings. Besides reducing the overall risk and making the network disaster-aware, reducing network resource usage and satisfying quality-of-service requirements can also be achieved in this approach. We also provide a cost analysis of employing a dynamic disaster-aware placement design in the network based on real-world cloud pricing.

Spasticity is a common complication of upper motor neuron (UMN) disorders. Subjective clinical measurements are not sufficient for assessment of spasticity Therefore, valid and reliable results of measurements require quantitative and objective in diagnosis and management of spasticity. In this study, surface electromyography (EMG) signals are used for electrophysiological assessment of the spasticity. Encouraging results were obtained related with the assessment and diagnosis of spasticity.

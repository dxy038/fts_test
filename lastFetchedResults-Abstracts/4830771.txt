Cloud computing as newly emergent computing environment offers dynamic flexible infrastructures and QoS guaranteed services in pay-as-you-go manner to the public. System virtualization technology which renders flexible and scalable system services is the base of the cloud computing. How to provide a self-managing and autonomic infrastructure for cloud computing through virtualization becomes an important challenge. In this paper, using feedback control theory, we present VM-based architecture for adaptive management of virtualized resources in cloud computing and model an adaptive controller that dynamically adjusts multiple virtualized resources utilization to achieve application Service Level Objective (SLO) in cloud computing. Compared with Xen, KVM is chosen as a virtual machine monitor (VMM) to implement the architecture. Evaluation of the proposed controller model showed that the model could allocate resources reasonably in response to the dynamically changing resource requirements of different applications which execute on different VMs in the virtual resource pool to achieve applications SLOs.

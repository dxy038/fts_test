This paper jointly considers robust filtering and communication issues. The limited bandwidth in control networks is taken into account when investigating filtering problem under scheduled releasing policy. We adopt the notion of communication sequence. Our objective is to find an optimal sequence and the corresponding filter for a given plant and the communication resource. For a given communication sequence, the problem is formulated into a periodic filtering problem for which a direct LMI design method is developed. Then a heuristic search method is proposed to seek a sub-optimal communication sequence, which greatly reduces the computational cost as compared with the exhaustive search method. An example is given to illustrate the design method.

Torque density of radial, axial and transverse flux machine topologies is investigated. A 10-kW, 200-rpm motor is chosen as a test case. Radial and axial flux motors that fulfill the key specifications of the selected test case are designed employing in-house analytical dimensioning tools and MATLAB genetic multi-objective optimization. Rather simple numerical approach is taken to study the transverse flux motor. A 20-pole-pair radial flux motor is found to outperform its axial and transverse flux counterparts in terms of torque density.

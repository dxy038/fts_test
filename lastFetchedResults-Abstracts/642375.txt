Objective
Prevention of arterial thrombotic diseases has high priority in developed countries. Because people who eat inappropriate food are prone to thrombotic events, regular intake of an antithrombotic diet may offer a convenient and effective way of prevention. The aim of the present study was to find herbs that have antithrombotic effects.
Methods

Herbs were crushed and centrifuged and the juice obtained was filtered. The effect of filtrate on platelet-rich thrombus formation was assessed by a shear-induced in vitro platelet function test (hemostatometry). Filtrates showing significant antithrombotic activity were further assessed by using a laser-induced in vivo thrombosis test in mice. The effect of orally administered herb filtrates on flow-mediated vasodilation was also measured.
Results

Common thyme and rosemary showed significant antithrombotic activity in vitro and in vivo. Neither herb affected flow-mediated vasodilation.
Conclusion

Some herbs possess antithrombotic effects in experimental models of thrombosis. The mechanism of the antithrombotic effect of common thyme and rosemary may involve a direct inhibitory effect on platelets.

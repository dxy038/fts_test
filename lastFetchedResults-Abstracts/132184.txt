BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The life time of patients with thalassemia major has been considerablely increased in recent years. Long- term complications such as liver and heart complications that caused by hemosiderosis create some problems for these patients. This study was done to evaluate the long- term effects of this disease on lung tissue by pulmonary function test.
METHODS: This analytical study was performed on 91 normal persons and 100 patients with thalassemia (over 5 years old) who referred to thalassemia research center. Both groups were matched according to their gender and age. After physical examination, ferritin was measured and chest X-ray and spirometry were taken for all persons in both groups. Parameters of pulmonary function test between two groups were compared and p< 0.05 was considered as a significant level in test.
FINDINGS: Patients with thalassemia had regular transfusion and 94% of cases received desferral. Spirometric results in 63% of persons in case group and 75.8% in control group were normal. Spirometric dysfunction in case group was as a restrictive pattern (37%) and obstructive pattern was not seen. In control group, 15.4% and 8.8% of persons had restrictive and obstructive patterns, respectively. Also, simultaneous using that due to decrease of desferrioxamine limits the pulmonary functin test. Meanwhile pulmonary function abnormality in females was more severe than males (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Restrictive pattern was the most common spirometric dysfunction in patients with thalassemia. Pulmonary complications of this disease can be reduced by using desferral.

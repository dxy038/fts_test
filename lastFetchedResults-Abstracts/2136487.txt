Introduction: Cisplatin (CP) therapy may disturb cardiovascular system control. The objective of this study was to find baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in CP-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.

Materials and Methods: Eighteen male and female Wistar rats were randomly assigned to two groups; treated with CP (2.5 mg/kg/day) and the vehicle, for five consecutive days, and then were subjected to surgical procedure to determine BRS using three different doses (0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) of a-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine (PE).

Results: Serum levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, kidney weight, and kidney tissue damage score were increased in CP-treated animals. All doses of PE injection caused MAP increase and HR decrease. However, ?MAP and ?HR response to 0.1 mg/kg of PE were significantly lower in the CP-treated group (P < 0.05). BRS also was increased in a dose-dependent manner by PE in vehicle-treated group, but this was not the case in the CP-treated animals, and significant difference in BRS was detected between the two groups (P < 0.05) when 0.05 or 0.1 mg/kg of PE were infused.

Conclusion: CP-induced nephrotoxicity attenuates BRS possibly due to peripheral effect on the vascular system.

In an unreliable communication network, the most reliable source (MRS) of the network is a good candidate as the source for data broadcast. Previous studies focused on seeking either an MRS that maximizes the expected number of nodes reachable from it or an MRS that maximizes the minimum reachable probability from it. In this paper, we integrated the two aspects into a new double-Cobjective problem with a aim of seeking a node called an extended most reliable source (EMRS). Further, we transform this double-objective problem into three different single-objective problems respectively from three different perspectives. Moreover, we assume that the network has a complex unreliability, i.e. each edge has an independent probability while each node has an independent transmitting probability and an independent receiving probability. Both on the assumption and under the Open Most Reliable Path First (OMRPF) protocol, we present one polynomial-time algorithm respectively for computing each of three problems above.

We consider a variational formulation of blind image recovery problems. A novel iterative proximal algorithm is proposed to solve the associated nonconvex minimization problem. Under suitable assumptions, this algorithm is shown to have better convergence properties than standard alternating minimization techniques. The objective function includes a smooth convex data fidelity term and nonsmooth convex regularization terms modeling prior information on the data and on the unknown linear degradation operator. A novelty of our approach is to bring into play recent nonsmooth analysis results. The pertinence of the proposed method is illustrated in an image restoration example.

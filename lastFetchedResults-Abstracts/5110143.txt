In wireless communication system, an advance mechanism of Space-Time Codes (STC) are presented to get huge performance in term of data transfer rate. This system of coding incorporated the modulation, multiple transmitter antennas and encoding/decoding of channel at the base station (BS). It also has an optional receive diversity, which is integrated at the mobile station. There are two important basic elements in designing the Space-Time codes, one is the pair wise error probability and the other is spectrum distance. The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive analysis for newly introduced mechanism of coding. The authors supposed that all information about channel is kept by receiver i.e. Channel state information (CSI). This research presents comprehensive analysis of transmit diversity, fading channels, receiver diversity and STC, that are used to produce complete diversity as well as coding gain. In practical channel environment, single antenna is correlated because short of scattering and inadequate antenna spacing. The performance of all condition with no coding is evaluated.

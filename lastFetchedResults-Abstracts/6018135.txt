Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) includes requirements of power demands, installation capacities, loss of load probability (LOLP) levels, locations, and environmental limitations for emission controls. A combined model is described in this paper. Firstly, an exponential analytic model is put forward based on reliability interaction between interconnected areas, this model illustrates the influences of installed capacity of each area and transfer capability of the flowgate lines on the generation system reliability of every single area; Secondly, investment cost, operating and maintenance cost are included in the objective function, while flowgate transmission limitations and emission control are used as constraints in optimization. Two models were built to show the importance of coordination between GEP and transmission upgrade. Test results on five-bus system are presented and discussed.

Introduction: With The method of Activity Based Costing (ABC), first, identified activities and then direct and overhead costs associated with each activity are calculated based on allocation methods. The objective of this study was to estimate cost of Hematology ward in imam reza hospital of Tehran city in 2014. Methods: This is an applied, cross-sectional study. Data related to specific and overhead cost of Hematology ward in imam reza hospital collected by using activity-based costing in the first semester of 2014. For allocating the costs to the services of Hematology ward, first, allocation basses were determined, then direct allocation method was used to estimate the costs. Results: The findings of this study showed that the unit costs of CBC Test, Malaria slide, Cell Count of Biological Fluids and Reticulocyte count were 72673 , 64678 , 48509 and 48508 Rials respectively. Between the cost centers, the highest costs belonge to depreciation of buildings (overhead) (714,117,127 Rials), personneles of Hematology) 4,182,223,581 Rials (and the Costs of materials and supplies (110,635,349 Rials), respectively. Conclusion: The findings of this study showed that estimated costs differ from tariffs. Only Cell Count of Biological Fluids tariff is greater than the estimated cost, the rest of the tests had less Tariff than estimated cost causing financial loss of the laboratory. For controling or increasing productivity, it is essential to focus on building depreciation costs (e.g. increasing the number of tests) and to increase the productivity of manpower and materials and supplies be done proper planning. By excluding depreciation cost of building in costing, all tariffs were higher than the estimated cost.

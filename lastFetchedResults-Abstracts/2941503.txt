A chaotic bidirectional associative memory (CBAM) is proposed and simulated. It can deal with one-to-many associations such as {(A,a), (A,b), (A,c),&#183;&#183;&#183;}. In the CBAM, in order to enable one-to-many associations, each training pair is memorized together with its own contextual information and chaotic neurons are employed in a part of the network corresponding to the contextual information. Since the chaotic neurons change their states by chaos, the one-to-many associations can be realized in the CBAM

Developing future weapons systems has become increasingly complicated and costly. The armed forces
of major nations use modeling and simulation techniques for new weapons systems from the conceptual
stage to design, production, deployment and training stages to shorten the development cycle and
guarantee their effectiveness. Failure in the development cycle carries too much loss in time and
money. Therefore, computer-based modeling and simulation techniques are applied from the conceptual
stage to gauge the efficacy of new weapons systems. The objective of this study is to develop a
modeling and simulation methodology for small scale engagement using the DEVS formalism. The entities
required for modeling and simulation are divided into three categories: combat, logical, and environmental
entities. Combat entities represent the military hardware or combatants; logical entities
represent the judgment and decision entities for the interaction between various entities; and environmental
entities emulate the constituents of real combat environment. The combat entities are further
modeled into Shell and Core Parts to maximize their reusability under various combat scenarios. The
proposed framework is verified using a one-on-one combat engagement simulation (written in C++)
between two submarines.

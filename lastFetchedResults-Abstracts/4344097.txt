Electromagnetic imaging of buried multiple conductors by using genetic algorithm has been presented. Two separate perfectly conducting cylinders of unknown shapes are immersed in one half-space and illuminated by transverse magnetic (TM) polarization plane wave from the other half-space. Based on the boundary condition and the measured scattered field, we have derived a set of nonlinear integral equations, and the imaging problem is reformulated into an optimization problem. For describing the shapes of conductors, the Fourier series is selected to expanding the shape functions. In inverse algorithms, the improved steady state genetic algorithm is employed to search for the global extreme solution of objective function. Numerical results have demonstrated that the powerful performance of the inverse algorithm. The reconstructed shapes are considerably accurate even when the initial guesses are far away from the exact ones and the buried depths of the conductors are large compared to wavelength.

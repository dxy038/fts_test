The objective of this study is to measure the city of Tehran’s environmental quality in 2006 (the
last census year). Primarily, with a comparative analysis of a variety of urban sustainability indicator models,
a collection of 54 indicators have been chosen and categorized as indicators of increase or decrease in urban
environmental quality in the form of a simple mathematical model. Based on the aforementioned model,
Tehran’s environmental quality in 2006, having obtained a score of 59.5%, has been evaluated as “middle
ranking”. After continuing the evaluation more meticulously, it became known that the individual healthcare
indicator with a 91% score and the safety and security indicator with a 19% score had the highest and lowest
quality respectively in the city. Repeating this evaluation in the future will show the condition of the city’s
movement toward establishing a sustainable city. Furthermore, it will clearly demonstrate the reasons affecting
the high or low speed of this movement.

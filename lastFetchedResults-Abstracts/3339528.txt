In this paper, we investigate the workings of threshold (TH) based spike detection for neuronal extracellular field potential spikes. Thresholding is the most used spike detection method. In general, it is employed by setting the TH as per convention and without considering either the undetected or spurious spikes. In this paper, we provide insight in to the workings of thresholding, and proposed a new objective way to set the TH based on spike count histogram analysis. We illustrate the method with 2D and 3D simulations and analysis of measured data.

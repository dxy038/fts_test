Introduction: Prevention and reduction of the risk of injury are more important than treatment. Injury prevention is one of the main objectives of sports sciences. This objective can be reached through screening before participation in physical activities. Thus the purpose of this study was to perform functional movement screening (FMS) among students for sports injuries prevention.
Materials and Methods: The study participants consisted of 180 boys with the mean age of 18.1 ± 1.0 years, height of 1.76 ± 0.56 m, and weight of 65.2 ± 13.3 kg. The FMS tests of deep squat, hurdle step, inline lunge, shoulder mobility, active straight leg raise, trunk stability pushup, and rotary stability were used for screening. Chi-square test was used for the analysis of data and investigation of the relationship between subjects’ level of performance (good, average, and poor) (P  <  0.001).
Results: Results showed that 66 students (36.7%) had a total score of less than 14. Most movement impairment patterns were observed in the rotary stability (26.7%), active straight leg raise (25.6%), shoulder mobility (17.2%), and inline lunge (15.6%) (P  <  0.001).
Conclusion: It can be concluded that most students had poor movement patterns and were at risk of injury. Therefore, FMS should be incorporated into preparticipation screening in order to determine those susceptible to injury and perform prevention strategies.

Summary form only given. We present an approach to the admission control, resource allocation and routing problem in connection-oriented networks that offer multiple services to users. Users´ preferences are summarized by means of their utility functions, and each user is allowed to request more than one type of service. Each requested service may be delivered over one of many possible routes, and must satisfy certain quality of service (QoS) requirements. We assume that the relation between QoS and resource allocation is given, and incorporate it as a constraint into a static optimization problem. The objective is to determine the amount of required resources and route for each type of service so as to satisfy the QoS requirements and maximize a welfare function that is equal to the sum of the users´ utilities. We describe a competitive market economy that achieves the objective and satisfies the informational constraints imposed by the nature of the decentralized resource allocation and routing problem. We briefly describe the market economy, the problem´s information structure and market mechanism.

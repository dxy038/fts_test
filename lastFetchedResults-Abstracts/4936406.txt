To solve the problem of matching slabs and coils against orders in the process of hot rolling production in steel industry, we introduce matrices in which the element indicates difference between slab material and steel required in order, and also matrices in which the element indicates difference between coil and steel required in order. A multi-objective 0-1 programming model is established. And then, an improved genetic algorithm with sub-integer encoding method and heuristic repair strategy is proposed. Finally, effectiveness of the model and algorithm is verified by simulation based on actual production data. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method could gain more scientific and reasonable matching results.

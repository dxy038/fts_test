A multichannel system for packet radio networks is considered. A portion of the users (local users) is assigned a specific channel for their transmissions. Another portion (marginal users) may transmit through any of the channels via some channel selection policy. The main objective is to reduce delays for marginal users, without imposing heavy penalties on the delays of the local users. A previously studied limited sensing random access algorithm and two dynamic channel selection policies are adopted. The stability region and the delays induced by the system are studied. The selection policies present marginal users with a significant delay advantage and induce fair utilization of the transmission channels, without requiring any knowledge about the system state by the users. One of the selection policies includes high system throughput, at the expense of implementation complexity and increased delays for local users. The second is easier to implement and does not penalize the delays of local users at the expense of reduced system throughput. Both policies induce comparably low delays for marginal users

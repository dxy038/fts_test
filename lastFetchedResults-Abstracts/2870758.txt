This paper proposes a novel method based fuzzy multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for the identification of the polynomial systems. First, choose the number of first order monomials using correlation-based orthogonal forward search algorithm. Then according to the correlation coefficient of monomial terms and output, the contribution of each monomial term to system output to narrow the scope of the candidate monomials. At last apply the fuzzy multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to get the identification results. The results show that compared with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and Akaike information criterion (AIC), the proposed method can get only one solution. At the same time, it can get higher accuracy for identification of the system structure.

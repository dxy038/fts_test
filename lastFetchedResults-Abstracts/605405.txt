Objective: To determine the psychometric properties of an Iranian version of the Palmore's Questionnaire called Facts on Aging Quiz (FAQI).
Methods: The psychometric properties including face validity, content validity, construct validity, internal consistency, and test- retest reliability were measured in 280 nurses who were working in the emergency, medical, and surgical wards of 5 randomly selected general hospitals associated with medical schools in Tehran.
Results: The results of known groups' comparisons showed that this questionnaire could successfully discriminate between subgroups of nurses with different prior work experiences with the elderly and/ or had the experience of living with older people in the family. The internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) was 0.81. Test-retest reliability (ICC) of the questionnaire with interval time of two weeks was 0.98(P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Based on the results of the present study, the Farsi-version of FAQ 1 is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring nurses’ knowledge about older people. We concluded that the FAQI appears to be a promising tool, providing reliable and valid data helping to detect knowledge among nurses in different settings such as clinical settings, and research environments by health care providers and researchers.

This paper summarizes CERN R&amp;D work done in the framework of the European Commission\´s FP6 BioCare Project. The objective was to develop a novel "time-based" signal processing technique to read out LSO-APD photodetectors for medical imaging. An important aspect was to employ the technique in a combined scenario for both computer tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) with effectively no tradeoffs in efficiency and resolution compared to traditional single mode machines. This made the use of low noise and yet very high-speed monolithic front-end electronics essential so as to assure the required timing characteristics together with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Using APDs for photon detection, two chips, traditionally employed for particle physics, could be identified to meet the above criteria. Although both were not optimized for their intended new medical application, excellent performance in conjunction with LSO-APD sensors could be derived. Whereas a measured energy resolution of 16% (FWHM) at the 511 keV photo peak competes favorably with that of \´classical\´ PMTs, the coincidence time resolution of 1.6 ns FWHM with dual APD readout is typically lower. This is attributed to the stochastic photon production mechanism in LSO and the photon conversion characteristic of the photo diode, as well as to the fluctuations in photon conversion, albeit the APD\´s superior quantum efficiency. Also in terms of CT counting speed, the chosen readout principle is limited by the intrinsic light decay in LSO (40 ns) for each impinging X-ray.

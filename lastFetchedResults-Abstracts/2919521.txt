A method is presented for the design of a composite controller for a class of two-time scale nonlinear singularly perturbed uncertain systems. The objective of the slow and the fast controllers is to assure, for any realization of the uncertainties, uniform ultimate boundedness of the trajectories of approximate models of the slow and the fast system dynamics. The conditions under which the sum of these controllers leads to a composite controller guaranteeing uniform ultimate boundedness of the complete system are derived

The objective of the DGFACTS project [1], funded by the European Commission, is the application of power electronic systems to improve the Quality of Supply (QoS) of the electrical network, in a high Distributed Energy Resources (DER) penetration scenario. Its main result will consist of the development of a set of power electronic equipment to improve the different aspects covered by the wide electrical QoS concept.

This paper compares the performance and parameter characteristics of Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCV) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) with a view towards an objective assessment of the relative performance of these vehicles. In particular, this paper reviews major characteristics of fuel cell powered vehicles (FCVs) as zero or ultra-low emission vehicles (ZEV/ULEVs), their presumed high efficiency, while also considering their limited performance at high power demands. The paper also considers the main characteristics of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) as low emission vehicles (LEVs), including presumed high efficiency. The paper presents comparison for well-to-wheels emissions for various vehicles. Well-to-wheels efficiencies, emissions, and fuel economy are compared for FCVs and HEVs. In addition, other issues like battery types for HEVs and HFCVs are explored in this paper. The potential control strategies for FCVs and HEVs will be discussed and compared. In both FCVs and HEVs, best control strategies need to rely on predicting the driver command, which presents a particularly challenging opportunity for further development. The paper also gives the comparison of total costs for FCVs and HEVs. Finally, the commercialization issues for both FCVs and HEVs are mentioned in the paper.

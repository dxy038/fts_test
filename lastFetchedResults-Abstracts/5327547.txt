In order to realize the electromagnetic spectrum compatibility between satellite subsystems, this paper puts forward a method based on interference analysis algorithm and genetic algorithm. According to this method, establish a mathematical model, optimize the mathematical model of satellite subsystem using genetic algorithm. This algorithm is based on frequency parameters to established the mathematical model as the objective function. Realize this objective function, then optimize it using genetic algorithm. Through analysis and verification again, itÂ´s proved convenient and effective.

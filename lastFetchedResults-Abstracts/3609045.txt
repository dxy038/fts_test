A flexible prediction block decompostion method is presented with three transform tools in terms of a multi-channel filter bank system for the latest video coding standard H.264/AVC. The 4times4 and 8times8 integer discrete cosine transforms of H.264/AVC are subsituted by these new tools such that the transform is quite well adapted to variable prediction blocks. As a result, block artefacts are reduced without much effect on the sharpness of the content, and the spatial relativity is utilised quite efficiently for prediction blocks of bigger size. Consequently, the subjective quality as well as the objective quality is improved.

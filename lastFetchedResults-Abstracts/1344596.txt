The objective of the “MEM-BRAIN” project is the development and integration of ceramic and polymeric gas separation membranes for zero-emission fossil power plants. This will be achieved using membranes with a high permeability and selectivity for either CO2, O2 or H2, for the three CO2 capture process routes in power plants, thus enabling CO2 to be captured with high-purity in a readily condensable form.

For the pre-combustion process, we have developed ceramic microporous membranes that operate at intermediate temperatures (≤400 °C) for H2/CO2 separation. For the oxyfuel process, we have developed dense ceramic mixed oxygen ionic-electronic conducting membranes that operate at 800–1000 °C for O2/N2 separation. The perovskite-type oxide Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF5582) was taken as the reference material for this application. For the post-combustion process, polymeric and organic/inorganic hybrid membranes have been developed for CO2/N2 separation at temperatures up to 200 °C.

In addition to the development of membranes, we consider the integration of the membranes into power plants by modelling and optimization. Finally, specific technical, economic and environmental properties of CO2 capture as a component in a CCS process chain are assessed, analysing the energy supply system as a whole.

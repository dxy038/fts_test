The learning ability of human plays an important role in our everyday life. The study of learning ability will be of great help to treat some movement disorders. A new experiment system can be used to study upper limb learning and control process, which consists of Optotrak Certus 3-D positioning system, EMG acquisition module and force feedback joystick. It is the first time to combine high-resolution positioning system with force feedback device. Using multi-threaded, dual caching technology to achieve the parallel storage and real-time display of several measuring data, and realize multiply force feedback forms. The result of a simple experiment shows that the platform can control the form of the feedback force effectively and record the kinematic and physiological information accurately, which laid the foundation of the research about upper limb motor learning and control.

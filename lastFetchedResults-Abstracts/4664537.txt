This paper highlights the design and implementation details of Classroom Driver Training Simulator (DTS) for Arjun Main Battle Tank (MBT) driver. The main objective of the classroom DTS is to train the ab-initio driver on the functions of switches and controls along with the procedures to be followed for driving the tank. The driver will get trained on various start up and stopping procedures followed in the MBT. This is like a virtual instructor system for the new recruits where they learn about the system using bilingual (Hindi &amp; English) online help. This self learning system also enables the driver to get practice on the functions of switches and controls present in the driver compartment of MBT using soft panel switches. This simulator has synchronized visual and aural cues to train the driver in the virtual environment.

Aiming at balancing the load of assembly line and the consumption rate of parts, establishing a multi-objective model of mixed assembly line. Using simulated annealing algorithm which can effectively solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems to solve production sequencing problem and to balance the assembly line. By analyzing the example results in different scaled from NEH and simulated annealing algorithm, verifying the effectiveness that simulated annealing algorithm can get better solution than NEH.

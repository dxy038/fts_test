This paper adopts the internationally acknowledged evaluation principles and profoundly builds up the comprehensive evaluation index system and objective function as for the problems of one-sidedness and subjectivity existing in the current product evaluation system, and calculates objective weight of each index. It has brought forth the comprehensive evaluation method to compare product level according to membership values, establishment of objective function, and studies the entropy weight computation model of diverse indexes in addition to the comprehensive evaluation approach of diverse weighting. Verifies through example, this approach helps solve the common problems in product evaluation at the current level and furnishes the clients with theoretical reference for product selection.

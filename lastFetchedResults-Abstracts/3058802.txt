The demand in fast electronics and in electronics high frequency permits the emergence of new types of components and notably the heterojunction bipolar transistor: the THB. Achieved initially from the III-V materials, this component permits to reach frequencies of working (of few tens GHz) until then inaccessible with the silicon bipolar components. Nevertheless, the electric performances of the HBT Si/SiGe can be penalized by the presence of the defects introduced by the etching of polysilicon and which are the origin of a low frequency noise "B.F" weakening with the correct application of the component. This work has for objective, to simulate the influence of these deep defects on the electric characteristics of an HBT with a SiGe base integrated in BiCMOS technology. The emitter is a polysilicon one; it is etching in a single quasi self-aligned architecture is considered. The signature of these defects permits to observe their repercussion on the component electric behavior.

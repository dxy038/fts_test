OMIC technologies, including transcriptomics and metabolomics, may provide powerful tools for identifying the effects of nutrients on molecular functions and metabolic pathways. The objective was to investigate molecular and metabolic changes following n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation in healthy subjects via traditional biomarkers as well as transcriptome and metabolome analyses. Thirteen men and 17 women followed a 2-week run-in period based on Canada's Food Guide and then underwent 6-week supplementation with n-3 PUFA (3 g/day). Traditional biochemical markers such as plasma lipids, inflammatory markers, glycemic parameters and erythrocyte fatty acid concentrations were measured. Changes in gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assessed by microarrays, and metabolome profiles were assessed by mass spectrometry assay kit. After supplementation, plasma triglycerides decreased and erythrocyte n-3 PUFA concentrations increased to a similar extent in both genders. Further, plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and fasting glucose levels increased in women after n-3 PUFA supplementation. N-3 PUFA supplementation changed the expression of 610 genes in men, whereas the expression of 250 genes was altered in women. Pathway analyses indicate changes in gene expression of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, nuclear transcription-factor kappaB, oxidative stress and activation of the oxidative stress response mediated by nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2. After n-3 PUFA supplementation, metabolomics profiles demonstrate an increase in acylcarnitines, hexose and leucine in men only and a decrease in saturation of glycerophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine concentrations in all subjects. Overall, traditional and novel biomarkers suggest that n-3 PUFA supplementation exerts cardioprotective effects.

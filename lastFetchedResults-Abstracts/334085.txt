Objective
Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of imaging modalities in detecting the underlying pathologies in patients with pulsatile tinnitus.
Materials and Methods
Seventy-four patients with pulsatile tinnitus were radiologically evaluated. All patients except two are evaluated on a thin-section bone algorithm computed tomography scan covering the temporal bone and skull base, 14 patients with or without contrast-enhanced brain computed tomography, 7 patients with magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography, 5 patients with digital subtraction angiography, and 12 patients with Doppler ultrasonography.
Results
The underlying pathology of tinnitus was detected in 50 patients (67.6%), and 24 patients were normal with radiologic studies. The most common cause was high jugular bulbus (21%) followed by atherosclerosis, dehiscent jugular bulbus, aneurysm of internal carotid artery, dural arteriovenous fistula, aberrant internal carotid artery, jugular diverticulum, and glomus tumor.
Conclusion
It was concluded that radiologic imaging methods are effective in detecting the underlying pathology of pulsatile tinnitus.

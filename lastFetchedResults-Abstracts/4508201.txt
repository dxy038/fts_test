The air by-pass rate is one of the important parameters in the heat pump drying system with close air circulation. Considering the characteristics of dehumidifying and energy consumption, the optimization model has been deduced with specific power consumption (SPC) as objective function. On the basis of one example optimized by genetic algorithms, the optimum air bypassing rate and other working parameters have been given. It is useful for heat pump drying systemÂ´s design and operation.

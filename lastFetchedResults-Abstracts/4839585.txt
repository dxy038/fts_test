Real world optimization problems are challenging as they often involve a large number of variables and highly nonlinear constraints and objective functions. While a number of efficient optimization algorithms and numerous mathematical benchmark test functions have been introduced in recent years, the performance of such algorithms have rarely been studied across a range of real world optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce an improved adaptive differential evolution (DE) algorithm and report its performance on the newly proposed real world optimization problems. The proposed differential evolution algorithm incorporates adaptive parameter control strategies; a center based differential exponential crossover and hybridization with local search to improve its efficiency. While comprehensive results of other algorithms on the test problems are unavailable at this stage, our preliminary comparison with published results indicates promising performance of the proposed DE across the range of problems.

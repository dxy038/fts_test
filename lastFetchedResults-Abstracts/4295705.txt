The real-time and dynamic customer demand analysis technology is required by the mobile operators in order to respond to the customer demand efficiently and automatically. This paper makes a mobile customer demand analysis model and proposes ways to capture customer demand knowledge. Based on CVD theory, the mobile customer value layers is gotten by investigation and specific interview. Then the significant attributes of customer value layers are screened out. Finally, a customer demand discrimination model is built while making the customer demand objective as the output of the model and making customer demand attribute as the input of the model. Well-formed model could judge the classification of customer demand objectives dynamically from their demand attributes. This model is used in analysis of mobile customer samples. Compared with previous methods of customer clustering analysis, itÂ´s more precise and higher in intelligence level

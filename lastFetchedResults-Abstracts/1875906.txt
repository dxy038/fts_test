Objective: To measure state anxiety and related physiological correlates at 3 selected times when patient education regarding electrophysiology (EP) studies is likely to occur: 24 hours before the EP study (pre-procedure teaching), 1 hour before the EP study (reinforcement of pre-procedure teaching), and 3 hours after the EP study (explanation of results; reinforcement of post-procedure instructions). Design: Descriptive-exploratory. Setting: Military medical treatment facility in mid Atlantic region. Subjects: Thirty-two adults who underwent initial EP testing. Outcome Measures: The Spielberger State Anxiety score, frontalis muscle tension, heart rate, electrodermal activity, electrothermal feedback, and mean arterial pressure. Methods: Outcome measures were obtained 1 day before (time 1), 1 hour before (time 2), and 3 hours after (time 3) the EP study. Results: Both state anxiety scores and physiological variables indicated minimal psychophysiological reactivity. Conclusion: Patients undergoing initial EP studies experience moderate state anxiety and manifest a paradoxical pattern of autonomic responses over time. Moderate levels of state anxiety at each of the 3 assessment points would seem to indicate that patient education is appropriate at these times. (Heart LungÂ® 1998;27:374-86)

Sarcophagid species are found in different seasons and different locations. The main objective of this research is to identify life cyle of Parasarcophaga ruficornis flies in rainy season for PMI estimation. Most of the work has been done in Europe, America and Australia but in India very little work is done on this aspect. In rainy season some of sarcophagid species are active.In Ahmednagar region is P. ruficornis commonly found in rainy season. The flies were allowed to lay the larvae and the life cycle stages were studied every day. The maximum and minimum temperature and humidity were recorded every day since the temperature and humidity plays important role in the span of the life cycle stages. Flies are larviparous and lay first instars larvae.The maggots took four days to reach the pupation stage, while pupation lasted for eleven days to emerge as the adult.The whole life cycle was completed in sixteen days.

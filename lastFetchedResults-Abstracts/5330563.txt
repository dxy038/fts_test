In this paper, in order to Pareto design of cyclone separators, pressure drop and collection efficiency &#916;p and &#951; in a set of cyclones are numerically investigated using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) techniques. Then, the neural network is used to obtain polynomial models for the effects of geometrical parameters of the cyclones on both the pressure drop and the collection efficiency. The obtained simple polynomial models are used to find the best possible combinations of the pressure drop and collection efficiency, known as the Pareto front based on a novel multi-objective algorithm.

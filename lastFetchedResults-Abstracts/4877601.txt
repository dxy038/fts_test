Dual-active bridges (DABs) can be used to deliver isolated and bidirectional power to electric vehicles (EVs) or to the grid in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications. However, such a system essentially requires a two-stage power conversion process, which significantly increases the power losses. Furthermore, the poor power factor associated with DAB converters further reduces the efficiency of such systems. This paper proposes a novel matrix converter based resonant DAB converter that requires only a single-stage power conversion process to facilitate isolated bi-directional power transfer between EVs and the grid. The proposed converter comprises a matrix converter based front end linked with an EV side full-bridge converter through a high frequency isolation transformer and a tuned LCL network. A mathematical model, which predicts the behavior of the proposed system, is presented to show that both the magnitude and direction of the power flow can be controlled through either relative phase angle or magnitude modulation of voltages produced by converters. Viability of the proposed concept is verified through simulations. The proposed matrix converter based DAB, with a single power conversion stage, is low in cost, and suites charging and discharging in single or multiple EVs or V2G applications.

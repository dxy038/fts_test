Objective: To determine the prevalence of HIV seropositivity in patients with facial fractures in Edinburgh, UK. Design: A prospective study of 100 consecutive patients in 1994. Setting: Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, City Hospital, Edinburgh, UK. Subjects: 100 patients with facial fractures who were willing to participate in the study. Main outcome measures: Details of facial fractures. Assessment of risk factors for HIV. The seroprevalence of HIV based on unlinked anonymous testing of saliva. Results: None of the participants were HIV positive on saliva testing. Nine patients were found to have one or more risk factors for HIV. Eight patients had been tested for HIV previously. Conclusion: Direct history taking appears to be effective in eliciting risk factors for HIV. A detailed risk factor history should be taken for all patients with facial fractures. Continuation of this study may establish whether or not there is a link between facial bone fractures and HIV seropositivity.

In this paper, a method is proposed for modeling the loss in power systems for the economic dispatch problem. It is based on the analysis of number of second order polynomial equations which model the loss so that by calculating the coefficients of these equations the loss relation is obtained which is the main objective. Using the noted equations and some load flows then curve fitting between them, the coefficients are calculated. A case study is used to evaluate the proposed method and the results are compared with the results of conventional B-method and those obtained by the load flow. The Accordance between the results of the proposed method and load flow shows the accuracy of the model. The method also enjoys simple equations and process and besides it is not as time consuming as some other methods.

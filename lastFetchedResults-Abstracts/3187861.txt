This study investigated how does music piracy in public high school students relate to music piracy awareness, cyber-law, copy right laws, intellectual property laws, illegal file-sharing, judicial punishments, demographics, criminal liability and civil liability. If there is such a relationship, to determine how these varied with the recording industry association of America (RIAA) interest in stopping music piracy. The research compared the effect of the theoretical works on cyber-law, demographics, copy rights, intellectual property rights, moral and ethics to practical attitudes of the student with this concept. The RIAA is searching for how to limit the vast music piracy among U.S. high school students. The music piracy has emerged due to technologies that enable illegally pirating music at the expense of the artist and RIAA financial bottom lines. A quantitative analysis investigated U.S. high school students´ responses to various factors affecting music piracy. The objective was to assess high school students´ legal awareness of illegal music copying and their understanding of the cyber-law and its consequences. The variables used in designing the statistical analysis depended on the independents and dependent variables derived from the literature reviews. This research might be helpful to the music industry. It would aid in understanding that high school students do not care about either any adverse effect of music pirating or legal consequences associated to music piracy. The results showed that the students did not attach any importance to moral or ethics in music piracy. They were not in conscious awareness of the cyber-law and its judicial consequences in pirating music.

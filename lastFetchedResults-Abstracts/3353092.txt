In the last two decades, though the field of neuroprosthetics has gained tremendous momentum through the development of novel neural interfaces, however, till date there is no ideal device available. One of the critical requirements of the neural interface is to have higher electrode density to map neurons from large volume of brain but not at the expense of increasing the device footprint. There are neural probes available that have one electrode per shaft or at the best multiple electrodes on one side of the shaft. Till date, none of the existing technology offers active sites at both side of the shaft of the neural array, which will not only increase the electrode density but also will not change the footprint of the neural probe. This is becoming critical if one need to map the human brain. The objective of this work is to devise a methodology that can accommodate active sites on front and backside of the neural electrode array. The proposed device would increase the active sites density (double) and spatial resolution, which in turn will help to map every neuron in the human brain, in lieu with the objectives of BRAIN Initiative [1].

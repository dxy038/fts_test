Train schedule is the base of train organization as well as the fundamental working plan of transportation department. The running scheme of passenger train whose essence is to determine the initial schedule decides the skeleton of making the passenger train schedule. Present literatures researching train scheme considers the convenience for passenger travel or arrival and departure track dependently. On the basis of analyzing some constraint conditions such as the convenient to the passengers and the coordinate utilization of arrival and departure tracks and parking lines for rolling stock, taking the minimum of passenger carriage as the objective function, this paper establishes an objective programming model for optimizing the initial schedule of passenger trains, and puts forward a method for the model which is basing on improved genetic algorithm. The original time and the end time of passenger trains that satisfy the convenience to the passengers, economical carriage and the coordination between the utilization of arrival and departure tracks and parking lines for rolling stock can be obtained expediently by using this model.

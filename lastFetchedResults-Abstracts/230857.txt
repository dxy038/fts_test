This paper presents the study of the gamma exposure to the spent fuel pool walls from spent fuel assemblies. The Monte Carlo code, MCNP4C, was used to model and analyze the spent fuel pool walls. In addition, the gamma source from the spent fuel assembly was modeled by the isotope generation and depletion code, ORIGEN2.2. Both PWR (TMI-I) and BWR (PB-2) spent fuel pool models were investigated. The primary objective of the study was to determine the arrangement of the spent fuel assemblies to minimize the gamma radiation to the spent fuel pool walls. Different cases of spent fuel assembly configurations in the spent fuel pool were studied. The study results show the amount of gamma radiation deposited on each section of the spent fuel pool walls. Finally, the spent fuel assembly with axial peaking factor was also studied.

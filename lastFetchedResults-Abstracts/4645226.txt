Genetic recombination is an important process for DNA repairing and increasing genetic variation, thereby enriching the gene pools for the survival and vitality of a species. In eukaryotes, meiosis is a major means for genetic recombination. For genes on non-homologous chromosomes, mixing of paternal and maternal genes is achieved through different chromosome configurations at metaphase I of meiosis. The process is known as the genetic principle of independent assortment of unlinked genes. Recombination of paternal and maternal genes on homologous chromosomes can be achieved through the exchanges of non-sister chromatids resulting in crossing over or homologous recombination. The molecular mechanism of homologous recombination is complicated and often difficult for students to understand. The objective of this research is to develop an interactive computer program for learning this important biological process. The software program, along with related computer-based genetics learning programs such as mitosis and meiosis as well as cytogenetics laboratory training exercises, will be useful for genetics education at high school and university levels.

A binocular robot head, BETH, with ten degrees of freedom (DOF) has been developed for research in active vision. To complement BETH, a graphical simulation and visualization environment has also been developed. The objective of building the graphical system is to create a comprehensive design tool to design and study the dynamic behavior of sensory-motor systems and their interactions with the environment. This environment integrates perception and motor actions and features complete kinematic simulation of BETH, it´s sensors and it´s workspace. We demonstrate the utility of this environment in systematic and extensive experimental development of computational frameworks and algorithms for 3D active vision systems which utilizes multiple passive depth cues (stereo, vergence, and depth from focusing)

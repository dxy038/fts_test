This paper studies the problem of designing H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controllers for networked control systems with both network induced delay and transmitted data dropout by using time-varying sampling period method, where the number of data packet dropout is driven by a finite state Markov chain. Based on Lyapunov approach, sufficient conditions for the stochastic stability of the networked control system are derived and H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller design is also presented by using the multi-objective optimization methodology correspondingly. A simulation example is worked out to illustrate the effectiveness of our result.

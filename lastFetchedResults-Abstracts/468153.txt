Objective: The aim of this study was to describe conservative surgical management of polyethylene terephthalate (Mersilene, Ethicon, Inc, Somerville, NJ) mesh suburethral sling erosion as an alternative to sling removal. Study Design: Seven women who had undergone suburethral sling procedures with Mersilene mesh were found to have varying degrees of mesh visible in the vagina at 4 to 12 weeks after the operation. Three women with erosions <5 mm were treated in the office and 4 women who had 6 to 30 mm erosions underwent inpatient surgical revision, which consisted of trimming of mesh when needed, excision of granulation tissue, and re-covering of the erosion in 2 layers. Results: All 7 patients have been followed up for 6 to 37 months. Only 1 woman who underwent inpatient surgical revision had a recurrence (4 mm); this was treated successfully in the office. Conclusion: Vaginal erosions in suburethral sling procedures with Mersilene mesh can be managed initially with our conservative surgical technique. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:1424-9.)

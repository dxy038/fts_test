A method for the experimental optimisation of reconfigurable measurement systems able to operate with variable measuring requirements (flexible measurement systems) is proposed. The proposed method allows the identification of the configuration characterised by the best performance and, at the same time, is as insensitive as possible to the requirement variations. On the basis of the performance typology, a suitable objective function is first selected; then, its maximum at varying configurations is determined by means of a statistical analysis of the results of experiments designed with the aid of orthogonal arrays. In this way, without any loss of result dependability, the experimental effort is reduced with respect to a separate investigation of each configuration. Experimental results of the optimisation of a flexible measurement system operating in telecommunications company are reported

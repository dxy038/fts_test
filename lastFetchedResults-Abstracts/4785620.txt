In this paper, a joint optimization algorithm for cognitive radio (CR) network based on centralized spectrum sharing is proposed. A more practical scenario where the primary users (PU) transmit signals with multiple levels of power is studied in CR network. To reduce the computational complexity, a low complexity suboptimal power allocation algorithm is investigated. By solving the objective function, the optimal allocation of bandwidth and power are achieved. Simulation shows that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the system throughput, ensure the PUÂ´s performance as well as guaranteeing the QoS of the cognitive users (CU).

Estimation of sedimentation and erosion without sediment statistics serves as one of the main issues of basins and requires the application of empirical approaches to utilize data for managing plans. EPM model is one of the empirical methods widely used in the study of watersheds all over country. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of geological formations on annual erosion and sedimentation using EPM model and GIS and the investigation of its efficiency in erosion and sediment studies. Rock formation erosion and entering of huge sediments to Taleghan reservoir clarify importance of investigation on how sediments are produced and transported. In respect to the above results, it is worthy to note that Zidasht basin is moderate in terms of erosions and sedimentation and its erosion coefficient is 0.69. In addition, classification of erosion intensity showed that this basin has two intense and moderate classes implying that considering sediment and erosion is essential in soil and water conservation projects. The highest and lowest erosion intensity coefficients are observed in Dint2 and D1 respectively mainly due to presence of formations Ngm, Q1g, and orchards in sub-basin Dint2 and resistant formations of Ekta and Ekv and suitable rangeland land use in D1.

Mobile learning is a new technology embraced in the educational environment. In general, mobile learning can be described as teaching and learning activities by using mobile technologies. Designing interactivity with mobile learning is important for learners and educators. The requirements and different perspective towards mobile learning need to be explored. The demographic profiling of the user may also affect the usage and usability of mobile learning. Designers may need to identify the elements and relevant methodologies when designing interactivity of mobile learning. This main objective of this paper is to conceptualize the relationship model of (i) playful interaction, (ii) interaction design, (iii) kansei engineering and (iv) mobile usability in mobile learning. The model from this study may provide the motivation and prescription to designers in designing mobile application for teaching and learning.

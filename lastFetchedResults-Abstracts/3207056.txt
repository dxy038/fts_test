A user friendly software application was developed to study the electromagnetic interference problem between high voltage power lines and underground metallic pipelines. A hybrid method presented in previous papers is implemented in the software to calculate the induced A.C. voltage in pipeline. The dedicated developed InterfStud software was based on induced magnetic vector potential and ground correction terms evaluation. New analytical formulas for the induced magnetic vector potential and ground correction terms for self and mutual impedances are derived. The determined formulas contain semi-infinite integral terms which will be evaluated. We might seek approximations of the semi-infinite integrals by replacing an exponential or algebraic function, the objective being to permit analytic integration. Since there is no good systematic method for making these replacements, their success depends directly on the intuition and ingenuity, taking into account that in practice the integrand has limited accuracy.

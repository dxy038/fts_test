Introduction & Objective: Positioning is an important part of perioperative care that optimal respiratory function is a main purpose. Thus oxygen saturation measurement in routine surgical positions could be a proper index of respiratory function. Material & Methods: To determine effects of supine , prone and litatomy positions on arterial oxygen saturation , 31 healthy volunteer were positioned in each three position for ten minutes periods . oxygen saturation was measured by pulse oximeter. Results: there was no significant difference between 3 position in oxygen saturation Conclusion: Absent of prone and lithotomy positions effect on oxygenation in this study may be attributed to the short time that the subjects were in each position (ten minutes). we suggest that evaluation of position effect on oxygenation require further investigation.

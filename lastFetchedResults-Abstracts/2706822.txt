Timely nondestructive estimation of crop nitrogen (N) status is crucial for in-season site-specific N management. Active crop canopy sensors are the promising tools to obtain the needed information without being affected by environmental light conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for the GreenSeeker active crop canopy sensor to estimate rice (Oryza sativa L.) N status. Nine N rate experiments were conducted from 2008 to 2012 in Jiansanjiang, Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China. The results indicated that across site-years and growth stages, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) obtained with the GreenSeeker sensor could explain 73%-76% and 70%-73% of rice aboveground biomass and plant N uptake variability in this study, respectively. The NDVI index became saturated when biomass reached about 4 t ha<sup>-1</sup> or when plant N uptake reached about 100 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, whereas RVI did not show obvious saturation effect. The validation results, however, indicated that both indices performed similarly, and their relative errors (RE) were still large (&gt; 40%). Although the two indices only explained less than 40% of plant N concentration or N nutrition index (NNI) variability, the RE values were acceptable (&lt;; 26%). The results indicated some potentials of using the GreenSeeker sensor to estimate rice N status nondestructively, but more studies are needed to further evaluate and improve its performance for practical applications.

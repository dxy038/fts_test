The method of visual data mining analysis is important in acquiring the intelligible knowledge in massive initial data. Based on the characteristics of information operations in complicated information environment, the basic flow of requirement design and analysis for the visual data mining analysis for information operations was presented; then, take the visual data mining analysis of radar systems as the key experimental example, the spectral distribution of complicated information environment, the electromagnetic energy distribution, the ability of detection and tracking of radars as well as the assessment of the barycenter of a radar chain, etc. were discussed and analyzed in detail according to the basic content, flow and objective of the designed visual data mining analysis for information operations; finally, the outlook of the study was depicted.

Large-scale natural resource inventories generate enormous data sets. Their effective handling requires a sophisticated database management system. Such a system must be robust enough to efficiently store large amounts of data, and flexible to allow users to manipulate a wide variety of information. In a pilot project, related to a multiresource inventory of the Suwannee River Water Management District holdings in Florida, a new temporal database model is implemented. This model is a relational one with an enhanced entity relationship between component tables. It consists of a superclass, the spatial database index, and a number of subclass component tables related through a unique identifier. This superclass may be thought of as a central repository, where all the sample locations with their rectangular coordinates are stored. In addition, a unique identifier denoting various aspects of the sampling design is associated with the coordinates. The global positioning system is used to reference sample locations for periodic updates. The model is implemented via Oracle's database server. ArcView's Event Theme option is used to integrate the processed data with existing spatial datasets for further analysis. This approach has the advantage of working with smaller sets of data as opposed to the traditional geographic information systems spatial analysis. The A ultimate objective is to provide timely, cost-effective and reliable information for making intelligent decisions.

The EU fusion materials modelling programme was initiated in 2002 with the objective of developing a comprehensive set of computer modelling techniques and approaches, aimed at rationalising the extensive available experimental information on properties of irradiated fusion materials, developing capabilities for predicting the behaviour of materials under conditions not yet accessible to experimental tests, assessing results of tests involving high dose rates, and extrapolating these results to the fusion-relevant conditions. The programme presently gives emphasis to modelling a single class of materials, which are ferritic-martensitic EUROFER-type steels, and focuses on the investigation of key physical phenomena and interpretation of experimental observations. The objective of the programme is the development of computational capabilities for predicting changes in mechanical properties, hardening and embrittlement, as well as changes in the microstructure and phase stability of EUROFER and FeCr model alloys occurring under fusion reactor relevant irradiation conditions.

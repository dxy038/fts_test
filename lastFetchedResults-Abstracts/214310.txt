BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccine is administered worldwide to prevent severe forms of tuberculosis. It is considered to be safe; however, occasional complications are seen. The most serious complication is BCGosis. We report a case of BCGosis with granulomatous hepatitis and acid-fast bacilli in liver and spleen. We treated the patient with antituberculosis drugs without any response to treatment.

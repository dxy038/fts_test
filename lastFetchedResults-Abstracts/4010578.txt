In this paper, a fuzzy logic implementation of the random early detection (RED) mechanism [1] is presented. The main objective of the proposed fuzzy controller is to reduce the loss probability of the RED mechanism without any change in channel utilization. Based on previous studies, it is clear that the performance of RED algorithm is extremely related to the traffic load as well as to its parameters setting. Using fuzzy logic capabilities, we try to dynamically tune the loss probability of the RED gateway. To achieve this goal, a two-input-single-output fuzzy controller is used. To achieve a low packet loss probability, the proposed fuzzy controller is responsible to control the max<inf>p</inf> parameter of the RED gateway. The inputs of the proposed fuzzy controller are 1) the difference between average queue size and a target point, and 2) the difference between the estimated value of incoming data rate and the target link capacity. To evaluate the performance of the proposed fuzzy mechanism, several trials with file transfer protocol (FTP) and burst traffic were performed. In this study, the ns-2 simulator [2] has been used to generate the experimental data. All simulation results indicate that the proposed fuzzy mechanism outperforms remarkably both the traditional RED and Adaptive RED (ARED) mechanisms [3]&#8211;[5].

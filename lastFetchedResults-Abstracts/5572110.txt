Human capital is now generally accepted as the main limiting factor to growth in the microelectronics sector. To remain competitive in world markets, European industry must have access to an educated workforce in key enabling technologies such as electronic materials science, device physics, ULSI processing and microelectronics systems design. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of a new European Union Telematics Application Programme educational initiative in microelectronics; the Multimedia Optimisation and Demonstration for Education in Microelectronics (MODEM) project

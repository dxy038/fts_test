In this paper, a one-pass encoding algorithm is proposed for adaptive loop filter (ALF) in high-efficiency video coding (HEVC). ALF can improve both subjective and objective video quality, but it also requires a lot of encoding passes (i.e. picture buffer accesses) that will significantly increase external memory access, encoding latency, and power consumption. Therefore, we propose a method to estimate filtering distortion without performing real filter operation. The number of encoding passes can be effectively reduced from 16 to 1. Combined with an initial guess of filter-on/off blocks by using time-delayed filters, the proposed one-pass algorithm only induces average 0.17% BD-rate increase.

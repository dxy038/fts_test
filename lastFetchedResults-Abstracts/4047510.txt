A new zero voltage switching (ZVS) converter with a double-ended rectifier is presented to reduce switching losses on power semiconductors, decrease voltage stresses on rectifier diodes and achieve bidirectional power delivery to output load. A buck-boost type of active snubber is connected in parallel with the primary side of a transformer to recycle the energy stored in transformer leakage and magnetising inductors and to limit voltage stress on the main switch. During the transition interval, the transformer leakage inductor and the output capacitor of power MOSFET are resonant to realise the ZVS turn-on of the switch. Finally, the experimental results were given to demonstrate the circuit performance and to verify the feasibility of the proposed converter.

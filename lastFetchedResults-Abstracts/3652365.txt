A design project in dynamics and control performed by a group of seven senior students during one semester is described. The objective was to construct a wedge-shaped object and balance it in the inverted position. The degree of complexity of the dynamics of this wedge system is comparable to the well-known inverted pendulum and ball-on-a-rail experiments. The main advantage of the wedge experiment is that the design of the plantÂ´s dynamic structure is a part of the project.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

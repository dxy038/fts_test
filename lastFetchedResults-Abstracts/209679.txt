Nitrate and ammonium are matters of concern as the two main inorganic nitrogenous species
causing soil and water pollution. Nitrate, due to it's high mobility in soil and water systems, and
due to it's involvement in gastric cancer in adults and methemoglobinemia in infants, is being
more deleterious, as compared to ammonium. The main objective ofthis study was to determine
the effects of soil and Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. rooting zone on the nitrate and
ammonium removal from leaching water in saturated (laboratory) and semi-saturated soil
columns (open field). The nitrate retardation factor (R), was 2.39 on the average, and nitrate
dispersion coefficient (D) was equal to 7.57 and 10.18 cm2 hr" in control and planted saturated
columns, respectively. Soil l<.l was 0.35 in the nitrate batch adsorption isotherms. Planted
columns, in both saturated and semi-saturated conditions, removed nitrate dramatically as
compared to the controls. The removal coefficients were 30.18% and 84.71% for the saturated
and semi-saturated columns, respectively. Consequently, based on the results one can say
Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. is a suitable candidate as a nitrate phytoremediator.

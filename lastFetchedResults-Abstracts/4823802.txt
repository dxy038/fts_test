An adaptive palette reordering method is proposed in this paper to reshape the statistical properties of the color index map of a color-indexed image with a dynamic palette. Unlike other reordering methods, the proposed method extracts information from both the color index map and the palette to achieve the objective. The compression performance of JPEG-LS can be significantly improved when the proposed method is used

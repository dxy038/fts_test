We report simultaneous measurements of the radial velocity  Vr of a star,(zeta) Herculis, with two different telescopes and spectrometer systems, both located at Observatoire de Haute Provence, France. We believe that we detected for the first time in a solar type star a correlated signal in the time series of  Vr observed simultaneously with the two different instruments, due to the stellar oscillations. The objective of our observations was to compare the performance of the two systems, for the detection of stellar oscillations (astero-seismology). Both systems use a large portion of the visible spectrum of the star to increase the number of spectral lines on which to compute variations of  Vr, and a white-light channelled spectrum produced by a Fabry-Perot as a calibration of spectrometer drifts. The two calibration systems that we designed and implemented are however different. With the 193 cm telescope, we calibrated the ELODIE spectrometer with a fixed Fabry-Perot, while for the EMILIE spectrometer, we use the full AAA (Astronomical Absolute Accelerometer) system of Pierre Connes, with a tunable Fabry-Perot and various servo-controls. We first show, with three stars observed with ELODIE (Procyon, (eta) Cas and  (zeta) Her), that the auto-correlation function on a single-night time series is clearly significant when the periodogram shows significant peaks (Procyon and  (zeta) Her), while for (eta) Cas, nothing significant is seen in the periodogram nor in the auto-correlation function. Then we show evidence of the correlation of the two simultaneous, but independent, time-series obtained on a single night on  (zeta) Her, that we believe is the first reported clear case of simultaneous detection of stellar oscillations (solar type), which paves the way to future multi-site observations with a network of longitude spread telescopes. Finally, the observed fluctuations are compared, yielding an estimate of the instrumental (plus atmospheric effects) short term random error: (less than02.1 m s^-1 for EMILIE + AAA system, and (less than)2.9 m s^-1 for ELODIE + fixed Fabry-Perot system.

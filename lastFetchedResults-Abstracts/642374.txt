Objective
Selenoprotein-P is a selenium-rich serum protein that carries more than 50% of serum selenium. We evaluated changes in serum selenoprotein-P levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Methods

Serum selenoprotein-P levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty healthy individuals (controls), 34 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 37 patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) were studied.
Results

A highly significant correlation was found between the serum selenium and selenoprotein-P levels. There was no significant difference in serum selenoprotein-P levels between healthy controls (average 3.4 ± 0.8 μg/mL, n = 20) and patients with ulcerative colitis (3.0 ± 1.0 μg/mL, n = 34). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in patients with CD (average 1.8 ± 0.5 μg/mL, n = 37). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in the elemental diet group of patients who had CD (average 1.4 ± 0.4 μg/mL, n = 17) than in the non-elemental diet group of patients who had CD (average 2.1 ± 0.3 μg/mL, n = 20).
Conclusion

We found that the serum selenoprotein-P level is decreased in patients with CD. It may be a useful marker to monitor the systemic selenium status in various disorders.

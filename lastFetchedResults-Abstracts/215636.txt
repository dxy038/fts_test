The objective of this study was to validate the use of bone
mineral measurements of the calcaneus bone by dual X-ray
and laser (OXL) in a cross-sectional study carried out in an
osteoporosis clinic. Measurements of bone mineral density
(BMO) at proximal femur and spine were obtained by dualenergy
photon X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Osteoporosis
was defined by a OEXA T-score <-2.5 at the femoral neck or
lumbar spine. Sensitivity, specificity and kappa statistics for
OXL were calculated, assuming the OEXA measurement as
the gold-standard. The study included 475 women with a
mean age of 54Â± 11.9 years. 15% had osteoporosis while 39%
were osteopenic (-2.5 <T-score between <-l) at the femoral
neck or spine. A significant correlation (p<0.001) was found
between BMO values as measured by OXL at femoral neck
and OEXA at the lumbar spine. Assuming the same T-score
cut-off value for the diagnosis osteoporosis and a modified
cut-off value for the diagnosis of osteopenia (-2. 5<T-score<1.5),
yields a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 74% to
86% for the OXL device. In conclusion, BMO measured at
the calcaneal bone by OXL, has a good correlation with that
measured by axial OEXA.

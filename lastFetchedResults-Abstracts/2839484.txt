This paper reports a three-dimensional numerical study for the finned electric motor frame. The main objective is to optimize the housing geometry by choosing an appropriate number of fins for a given amount of housing material. A conjugated heat transfer problem is solved. Both laminar and turbulent flow with buoyancy effects is considered. In order to simplify the complexity of the numerical problem simplifying assumptions and simplifying symmetry properties are used.

The communication architecture of interactive energy measurement based on IEC62056 is structured by using a optical fiber ammeter. The overall frame of the communication standard, the model and function modules of the optical fiber ammeter based on the companion specification for energy metering (COSEM) are illustrated. The remote communication of the optical fiber ammeter is respectively given by the physical layer, the encapsulation layer and incident reporting. Reference for making bidirectional interaction communication protocol of intelligent electricity is provided, which is aimed to line with international practice.

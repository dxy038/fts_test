Growing concern for environmental issues and advancement in power electronic technology resulted in fast development of energy production using renewable energy resources (RES). These natural resources play an important role on power system generation and one of the most promising energy resources nowadays is the solar energy. Photovoltaic (PV) arrays are used to generate electric energy from sunlight and their penetration in electric power systems is increasing exponentially. However, these PVs are connected to power systems through power electronic converters which cause voltage and current harmonics to be injected into the systems. To quantify the harmonics produced by PVs precisely, two simulation models are introduced and modeled using Matlab Simulink. The objective of this research work is to compare the simulation results of the two models.

Efficient optimization techniques are important to manage interference in emerging dense wireless networks. Here, we address interference management through power control as a general utility maximization problem. For the class of utility functions that are concave in the logarithm of the optimization variables, we propose a power control algorithm based on fixed-point iterations. The iterations converge to the globally optimal power vector. One key benefit is that, for a network with N transmitters and a centralized implementation of the power control algorithm, the computational complexity per iteration of the algorithm is O(N<sup>2</sup>). When implemented in a distributed fashion and allowing for a signaling complexity of N messages per iteration, the computation complexity is reduced to O(N). We show that the proposed centralized and distributed versions of the algorithm converge to the optimal power vector at a linear rate. Our numerical results suggest that in most instances, the algorithm takes fewer than ten iterations to converge, even fewer if the initialization is close to the optimal power vector. The proposed algorithm is, therefore, very efficient for power control in slowly fading channels. Furthermore, unlike previous works in the literature, the proposed algorithm does not require the objective function to be separable into a sum of individual utilities. As an example, we present results for power control in a two-hop decode-and-forward cooperative relay network and illustrate the performance gains due to interference management.

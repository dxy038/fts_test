Power quality monitoring equipment now available provides the possibility of large scale power system monitoring, with the generation of literally gigabytes of recorded data. This leads to the necessity of establishing a power quality management system with properly defined data acquisition criteria and data retrieval and management methods. Based on a research work being developed by the authors, a proposal for establishment of such system are presented, with the following main topics being addressed: (i) data acquisition criteria: the registered disturbances can generate data in different fashions, allowing different levels of analysis; criteria for data generation must consider its specific use, such as to minimize data storage and maximize the efficiency of analysis; and (ii) definition of a management methodology and criteria for data retrieval and database management. The online generated PQ data must be processed on digital filters, defined to achieve specific goals, such the verification of standardized limits. The generation of statistics and so on. The overall objective of the database being the automated production of reports aimed at the management of the systemÂ´s power quality

This paper discusses a new concept of Scalable Home-Care Delivery for frail People with Special Needs (PwSN1), which we named TeCaRob2. This concept explores the use of robotics inside Smart House to remotely assist frail elders and other PwSN in diverse tasks of daily living. The goal is to provide PwSN with a complete solution for their daily needs. Our objective is to enhance the existing Smart House concept, which have proven successful in supporting PwSN, and which have been challenged when PwSN occupants need physical assistance.

CobiT4 provide a framework to evaluate the performance of IT management by using some control objective, method and standard maturity measurement [1]. Assessing maturity level is usually a first step to start audit process in an organization. Maturity Level adjustment can be a significant input to improve the process. CobiT4 has provide some maturity level characteristic for assess the existing condition in an organization, but in facts, there were some constraints to map existing condition into one exact score of maturity level measurement. Pederiva[2] proposed some approach to modify the maturity level measurement method which is more realistic approach for mapping the existing condition to some maturity level characteristics. The modified method for maturity level assessment then implemented on audit process at PT.Pos Indonesia using CobiT4 Framework. During the audit process, site visit, interview and questionarrie were using to collect data directly from all stakeholders. The scope of audit was limited into one control objective from CobiT4 framework, AI1, Identify Automated Solution. The audit results provide more realistic score for maturity level adjustment which are derived from fact finding and can express some real existing condition. Analysis from fact finding also can give some recommendation for improve IT resource management, especially on AI1 Control Objective scope.

Background/Objective: To determine the success rate of computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopic CT (FCT) and conventional CT (CCT) for needle navigation in biopsies from mediastinum, bone, abdomen, liver and pelvis. Patients and Methods: Data from 122 consecutive percutaneous interventional biopsies performed with use of FCT guidance (mean age of 50.5; range: 1–79 years) and 84 consecutive
biopsies with CCT guidance (mean age: 50.7; range, 12–83 years) were gathered from the interventional radiologist and general practitioner.
Results: The success rate of procedure was increased in the FCT group as compared with that of CCT group in some organs such as bone, abdomen, liver and pelvis. A statistically significant difference was noted when we compared FCT group with CCT in liver biopsies (P=0.019). The mean procedure time was lower in FCT group. The overall mean (±SD) FCT time was 200±90 (range: 20–400) sec; in CCT group, it was 420±260 (range: 605–800) second. Conclusion: FCT facilitates CT-guided biopsy procedures and reduces the procedure time by allowing visualization of the needle tip from skin entrance to the target point.

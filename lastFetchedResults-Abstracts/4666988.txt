The presence of a thick ice layer on a post insulator can change considerably the distribution of the electric field along this equipment, and that especially when a water film flows on the accumulated ice surface. The main objective of this paper is the modelling of electric field distribution along a post insulator covered with atmospheric ice with air gaps, using the boundary element method (BEM). Moreover, the influence of the presence of a highly conductive water film at the ice surface on the field distribution is also studied. The results contribute to the prediction of flashover on industrial ice-covered insulators

Objective: To observe the protective effects of Ginkgo biloba extract(GBE50) on the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury(IRI) of rats, and to investigate the evaluating functions of myocardial mechanics and hemodynamic information. Methods: 65 SD rats were randomly allocated into 6 groups: model group, GBE50 low/middle/ high dosage group, Danshen group, and Diltiazem group. The perfusion was stopped for 30 min after the heart was perfused in vitro for 15 min, and then it was reperfused for 40 min. The pressure in the left ventricle was recorded to observe the effects of drugs on myocardial mechanics and hemodynamics. Results: middle dosage of GBE50, Danshen, and Diltiazen could improve the heart functions after IRI, DP and plusmndp/dtmax were higher than those in the model group, and t-dp/dtmax and LVDP were lower than those in the model group. Conclusion: GBE50 could prevent the decrease of heart function after IRI to protect the heart function. And evaluation with myocardial mechanics and hemodynamic information is stable and credible.

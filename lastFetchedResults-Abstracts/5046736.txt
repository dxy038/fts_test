The main goal in the design of on board converters for distributed power architectures is size minimization, with power losses being the main constraint to achieve this objective. Very high efficiency has been obtained in this work in low output voltage (3.3 V) forward topologies, thanks to the use of self-driven synchronous rectification. Forward PWM topology with active clamp (FAC), forward with resonant reset (FRR) and forward with multiresonant switch ZVS-MRC are compared in this paper from the point of view of efficiency, switching frequency, losses in the synchronous rectifiers, transformer demagnetization, semiconductor stresses and EMI

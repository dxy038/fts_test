Design considerations for developing a highly directive broadband bidirectional distributed amplifier are discussed. Through effective binomial scaling of the individual device transconductances, directivities on the order of -25 to -35 dB have been demonstrated using computer simulation and measured S-parameter data for the NEC 9000 transistor. The circuit is broadband, with the potential for operation over an octave or more in frequency. Finally, it is noted that the circuit is bidirectional in that it may be driven from both ends of the gate line simultaneously with high directivity exhibited at each respective port on the drain line.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

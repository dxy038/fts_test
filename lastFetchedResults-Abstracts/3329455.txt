In recent years, there has been a trend on developing the grid connected vehicles. The futuristic grid connected vehicles need onboard bidirectional power converters to charge their batteries and return the power to the grid during the Vehicle to Grid (V2G) operating mode. This paper extends the functionality of this onboard power converter to a multiport power converter that integrates all the vehicleÂ´s sources and loads into a vehicular integrated power system. This highly integrated power system has unique characteristics and brings new functionalities into the vehicle. The general concept of the vehicular integrated power system is introduced in this paper. This concept is realized through the multiport series ac link power converter topology. The fundamental operations are demonstrated through the developed modular experimental setup.

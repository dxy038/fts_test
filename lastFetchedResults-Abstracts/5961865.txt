In the field of robotics aids for disabled people a number of different approaches are followed. The main difference between these systems is their use of a structured or an unstructured environment. A comparison between the different approaches is discussed in this paper. Of these concepts the MANUS system is treated in more detail. The implications of the MANUS concept for the different parts of the system (mechanics, electronics, user interface and safety) are worked out to some extent. A number of groups spread all over the world are working on robotic aids for handicapped people. Now that these systems reach the final stage of development the need for cooperation and integration between these groups becomes more important. A number of European projects are being started to reach this objective.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

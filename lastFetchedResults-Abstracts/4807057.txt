With the development of Web technology and it is applied in education, Web-based learning support systems (WLSSs) have been adopted all over the world. This paper presents a formal evaluation model for WLSSs based on the method of fuzzy integrated evaluation. We concentrate on the commonly factors and elements that ensure and contribute to the learning course. The model is comprehensive and objective, so that it can be used to evaluate all WLSSs. Based on the proposed model, some WLSSs are evaluated and compared with each other. Some further research issues are also discussed.

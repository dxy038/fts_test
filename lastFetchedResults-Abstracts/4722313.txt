With the rapid growth of computer technology, the applications of robots are not limited to industrial automation. Entertainment robots will be one of the most important emerging applications in the 21<sup>st </sup> century. The objective of the paper is that pet robot can conduct some arithmetic operation by using image signals through the Internet. The recognized pattern can have addition, subtract, multiplication, division and some numbers. The pet robot can recognize these image signals by using the binary method. When the calculated results from the pet robot are right, the head of the pet robot will nod. When the calculated results are wrong, the head of the pet robot will shake. The experimental results indicate that the pet robot can effectively determine the equation to be right or wrong by using the proposed method

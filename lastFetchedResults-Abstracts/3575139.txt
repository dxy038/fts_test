Toroidal fusion devices will require superconducting magnet systems of greater size and complexity than heretofore constructed. A program employing the talents of a number of organizations for the development of superconducting magnets for toroidal fusion devices has been inaugurated. The objective of this program is to demonstrate the suitability and reliability of toroidal superconducting magnets for fusion research devices and experimental power reactors (EPR) in a time compatible with the AEC Controlled Thermonuclear Research (CTR) program goal for EPR construction during early 1980Â´s. Since much of the superconductivity expertise resides now in AEC laboratories, the focus of the program is in these laboratories, but industrial and consultative participation is an integral part of the plan.

Background : Toluene and xylene are compounds of petrol that emit to ambient air through car exhaust pipe and affect humans' health. The biological factor for toluene and xylen is hippuric acid that is excreted in the urine.
Objective : To determine the biological concentration of hippuric acid in urine of workers occupied in gas pump stations.
Methods : 46 samples (23 before and 23 after working shifts) were collected and analyzed by spectrophotometer to determine the concentration of hippuric acid and creatinine. Findings : The mean concentration of hippuric acid in workers' urine before and after working hours were 0.116 and 0.95 gram per gram creatinine respectively ; thus no significant difference was shown. The concentration of hippuric acid in workers urine in afternoon shift was more than the morning shift (P=0.032). Also , the mean concentration of hippuric acid in workers less than 10 years occupancy was more than the other workers (P=0.002).
Conclusion : The concentration of hippuric acid in urine was less than the biological exposure determined by American conference governmental industrial hygiene.

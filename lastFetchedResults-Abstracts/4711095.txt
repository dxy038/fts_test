This paper studies the precoder design of a multi-relay multi-user bidirectional networks in which each relay is equipped with multiple antennas. We study the relay precoder design in the case of imperfect channel state information (CSI) and a norm-bounded error model is adopted. Then, we solve the power minimization problem under this scenario. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed robust precoding algorithm outperforms the non-robust solution.

Research based crop-specific best management practices (BMPs) must be developed for sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. saccharata) production to reduce the amount of nitrogen (N) leaching. The objective of this study was to identify irrigation and nitrogen BMPs for sweet corn production on sandy soils in Florida using the calibrated CERES-Maize model of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). A total of 24 irrigation schedules, 21 N fertilizer levels, 30 N application splits, and 20 N application rates per split were systematically evaluated in single factor simulations. Then, a set of 324 management scenarios composed of 6 irrigation timing/amount and 54 N fertilizer application strategies selected in early single factor explorations, was explored in a multifactor analysis.

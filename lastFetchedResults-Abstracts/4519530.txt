Technological advancements in the renewable energy sources (RES) have made us possible to bring out clean energy revolution by generating electricity in the decentralized way. But time-variable nature of these sources requires us to develop the sizing rules. This paper proposes design criteria of a standalone PV and BES system for GCOE, Amravati. The solar radiation data, ambient temperature data and electrical load data of the considered site are been used during the sizing steps. The objective is to design the system to supply the required electricity demand for the whole campus of the GCOE, Amravati. Numerical methodology is implemented to optimize PV array tilt angle using MATLAB. The life cycle cost (LCC) of energy is computed based on the total number of battery bank replacements through battery life- cycle model over the life period of the system.

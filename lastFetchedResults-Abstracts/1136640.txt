One of the properties of the Structuralistic approach in text analysis is the remark of binary oppositions. In fact, the opposition between culture and nature is considered as a structure, thus both sides of such opposition is involved in a relation of interactive, which is a positive relation. However, it is probable that in Ritual of Tazyeh culture and nature are combined with each other and they define one another constantly. Tazyeh is a cultural phenomenon, per se. But there lies nature in its basis. Now, if we do not regard to the nature in analysis of Tazyeh, it will fail to preserve its textural identity since natural elements make up in-textural layers of Tazyeh. Therefore, nature and culture are engaged in active definition and redefinition of each other in the domain of Tazyeh. For such purpose, in present article which has been composed in an analytical and descriptive method, separation of culture and nature, their adjustment and definition of that has been studied in this textural event. Hence, demonstration of the quality of reciprocal interaction between culture and nature in the process of the separation is the objective of this research.

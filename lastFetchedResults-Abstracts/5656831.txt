The dynamics of vocal fold vibration provide an objective means of evaluating the phonatory characteristics of individuals with laryngeal disorders. Glottal onset, pitch perturbation, and amplitude variation are analyzed prior to and after Teflon injection of the vocal folds in instances of unilateral vocal fold paralysis. This procedure permits a more precise determination of the potential benefit which may be derived from the operation, and may lead to an improved understanding of the relationship between the surgical treatment and subsequent phonatory capabilities of the patient.

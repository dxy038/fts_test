We report upon the prototype development of a wrist-worn integrated health monitoring device (WIHMD) with a tele-reporting function. The functional objective of the WIHMD is to provide information concerning clinical state, such as vital biosignals and locational information, to experts at a distance. Thereby, the unit provides the facility for rapid and appropriate directions to be given by experts in emergency situations, and enables the user or the supervisor to manage changes in health condition with helpful treatment.

We report the results of qualification testing of EmcoreÂ´s sixth generation III-V multi-junction solar cell - the 30% class GaInP2/Ga(In)As/Ge ZTJ cell. The ZTJ cell has undergone space qualification within the Air Force ManTech program utilizing the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) S-111-2005 standard. The S-111 tests comprise characterization tests and qualification tests. The objective of the characterization tests is to provide electrical, mechanical, and environmental data at the cell level to aid in the accuracy of on-orbit power predictions. The qualification test objective is to validate the present materials and manufacturing processes used in ZTJ cell and CIC level assemblies for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) applications. The ZTJ cell used in this qualification program is characterized by a beginning of life (BOL) maximum power point efficiency of 29.5% (135.5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) under simulated AM0 illumination at an operating temperature of 28&#176;C.

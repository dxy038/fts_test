A cage mill of a plant processing salts was analyzed using the simplified population balance model and a scale-up procedure was developed for predicting the industrial performance from information obtained from a pilot cage mill. Two fundamental assumptions were made, (1) that the non-load power consumption for the industrial and pilot mill was machine dependent and therefore a scale-up value should be determined and (2) that the specific energy consumption during grinding was material dependent only so that values obtained experimentally for a given material from the scaled-up pilot mill could be used directly to determine de operating condition of the industrial mill if a given grinding objective is specified.

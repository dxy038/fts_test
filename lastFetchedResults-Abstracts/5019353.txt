Geological heritage, the non-renewable geological natural heritage, is formed by inside and outside geological forces and is a special natural tourism resource with educational function. Using the Delphi and AHP methods to evaluate the geological heritage can make up for the shortcomings of AHP, the choice of factors and the determining of weights will be more scientific and objective. In this paper, the geological heritage resources comprehensive evaluation index system is established by using the methods, this system reflects that the natural occurrence of resource dominates its development value, &#8220;Value property&#8221; reflects the popular features and development benefits of geological heritage resources and &#8220;Development Conditions&#8221; is also essential external factors to resource quality. With Hubei EnShi Tenglongdong and Grand Canyon Geopark as an example, an empirical assessment of karst geological heritage in the study area is researched by the authors, the results show that it conform to reality, thereby proving that the use of Delphi and AHP methods to the evaluation of geological heritage resources is feasible.

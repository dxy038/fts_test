In a great many situations polarised waves are received on vectorial sensors. These waves are composed of several polarised sources associated with different modes of propagation. The objective of our work is to separate the polarised sources without a priori knowledge of the polarisation of each source and to apply this technique to elastic waves observed in a seismic sounding.

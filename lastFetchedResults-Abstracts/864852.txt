Nonylphenol has been found to exert estrogenic effects in fish and may affect the fertility of male fish. The objective of this study was to use the platyfish, Xiphophorus maculatus, as a model to evaluate the concentration-dependent effects of nonylphenol on the testicular structure. A tendency of a concentration-dependent decrease in the gonadosomatic index was observed after 28 days of treatment with nonylphenol. Histological examination revealed marked effects of nonylphenol on the testis structure. The effects were more pronounced at the higher concentrations of nonylphenol. This study strongly suggests that exposure to nonylphenol can result in decreased fertility in X. maculatus males.

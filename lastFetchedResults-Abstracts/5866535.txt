This paper presents a new voice conversion algorithm which modifies the utterance of a source speaker to sound like speech from a target speaker. Our method uses speech models based on phoneme units of speech, which finds accurate alignments between source and target speaker utterances. Using the alignments, vocal tract and glottal excitation characteristics are mapped across speakers. Objective and subjective tests suggest that convincing voice conversion is achieved while maintaining high speech quality, which is comparable to other frame-based approaches.

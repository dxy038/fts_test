Distributed mobility patterns based on relative speed, random direction of mobile nodes with variable communication range in mobile ad hoc networks are proposed. In these patterns, transient disturbances in routing tables and neighbor tables due to fast moving nodes and their effect on performance of network is considered. We introduced the concept of communication range and remoteness for mobile nodes and integrate these with the mobility of nodes through random waypoint mobility model. We characterized the mobility of nodes with new mobility patterns through optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol, without breaking the backward compatibility with earlier versions. Simulation results show that communication range should have value constraint according to mobility of nodes within network. Throughput also increases during mobility of nodes after establishing bidirectional link without any forwarding node as compared to static network.

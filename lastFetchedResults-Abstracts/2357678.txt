Peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch.) production is located in most areas of Iran, where flowering is damaged by temperatures. Using plant growth regulators to delay bloom is suggested as a measure to avoid frost damage. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of methyl jasmonate (MJ) and salicylic acid (SA) on peach bloom delay and yield. We evaluated applications of MJ 0 (control, water only), 100 and 200 mg L-1 and SA 150 and 300 mg L-1 at swollen bud and green tip stages. In ‘Elberta’ peach, MJ at 200 mg L-1, its combinations with SA 150 mg L-1 and MJ200 mg L-1 and SA300 mg L-1 together at two stages (green tip, swollen bud stages) delayed blooming for 6 and 8 days, respectively. The maturity and ripening of treated peach fruits delayed for 8-12 days in green tip and swollen bud stage. Flowering percentage amount (57.83-61.80%), fruit set amount (22.59-23.53%) and yield (1.69-1.72 kg cm-2 branch) were increased by MJ 200 mg L-1 and SA300mg L-1 treatments compared to control treatment (flowering percentage amount (39.31%), fruit set amount (6.25%) and yield (0.82 kg cm-2 branch)  affected. The interactions of MJ and SA had more impacts on flowering (89.53%), fruit set (33.22%), fruit weight average (124.93 g), and yield (2.09 kg cm-2 branch) compared with their single application. The present study was the first evidence for SA and MJ effect on bloom delay, flowering and fruiting of peach.

Fracture resistance (J-R) curves, which are used for elastic-plastic fracture mechanics analyses, are known to be dependent on the cyclic loading history. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of reverse cyclic loading on the J-R curves in C(T) specimens. The effect of two parameters was observed on the J-R curves during the reverse cyclic loading. One was the mmimum-lo-maximum load ratio (R) and the other was the incremental plastic displacement (deita(cycle/deita(i)),which is related to the  amount of crack growth that occurs in a cycle. Fracture resistance tests on C(T) specimens with varying the load ratio and the incremental plastic displacement were performed, and the lest results showed that the J-R curves were decreased with decreasing the load ratio and decreasing the incremental plastic displacement. Direct current potential drop (DCPD) method was used for the detection of crack initiation and crack growth in typical laboratory J-R tests. The values of crack initiation J-integral (J(1)) and crack initiation displacement (deita(i) were also obtained by using the DCPD method. Â© 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

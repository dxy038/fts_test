Heath information exchange (HIE) is the next step of health informatics development in China. Conformed to the administration feature, the design of HIE platform adopts a centralized architecture, which has to accommodate large amount of health information and support various types of query and data retrieval. Cloud computing is a suitable for the technology requirements of centralized design. In this paper, we proposed a medical information platform based on Hadoop, named after Medoop. The present Medoop utilizes HDFS to store the merged CDA documents efficiently, organize the feature information in CDA documents according to frequent business queries, and compute statistic distributedly in MapReduce paradigm. The objective of Medoop is to construct a comprehensive platform for health information storage and exchange, utilizing the components in Hadoop ecosystem.

Background and Objective: Hepatite B is one of the most important infection in the world. The best way to prevent hepatitis B infection is by getting the hepatitis B vaccine. The aim of this study was to evaluate level of HBs antibody titer of 10-18 years healthy students in Razavi Khorasan, North Khorasan and South Khorasan. 

Materials and Methods: This study was a descriptive analytic research that was performed on 565 serum samples that were collected from 10-18 years healthy students with demographic information in Razavi Khorasan, North Khorasan and South Khorasan. HBs Ab titers were measured with immunochemiluminescence assay. Data were analyzed using Chi-Square and t test.

Results: Out of 565 students, 20.6% in Razavi Khorasan , 20.1% in North Khorasan and 22.4% in South Khorasan had antibody in protective range ( > 10 IU/L). In addition, 79.85% of students were non-immune. There was no significant difference in antibody among level of education, and urban and rural location. The relationship between sex and titer of anti HBs was not statistically significant. The highest percentage of students with protective antibody was observed in 10 years old students (33.3%) and there was the lowest level of protective antibody in 18 years old (15.4%).

Conclusion: HBs Ab titer of students should be regularly evaluated because HBsAb level decreases after certain periods as age advances. Awareness of students about injection of booster dose of hepatitis-B vaccine is required.

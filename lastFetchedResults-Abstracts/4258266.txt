The use of a multi-turn railgun is a method for decreasing the current without reducing the electromagnetic force on the projectile. The objective of this investigation is the study of a novel multi-turn railgun that can launch several separated launching synchronously or unsynchronously. this method more over than distributing the force on the projectiles, prepare the projectiles launching with time spacing. The railgun has two barrels stacked in series and is powered by one pulse power supply. In this study by using a finite-element method we will simulate a three-dimensional railgun. The projectiles are in different position and in this research it is investigated by obtaining The self inductance gradient and mutual inductance gradient for each position of armatures that way it can regulated time of launch with changing the configuration of launcher. Moreover, Here it is obtained how launching time, which is directly proportional to the propulsive force, depends and is limited by rails and armatures geometry, armatures initial positions and armatures mass and material.

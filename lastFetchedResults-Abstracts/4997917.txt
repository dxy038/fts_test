Defect-based test studies have thoroughly characterized CMOS IC hard bridge and open defects while less is known about a third class called parametric failures. These are more difficult to detect, and their presence is growing in CMOS IC nanoelectronics. The objective of this work is to present data that encompass the electronic properties of parametric failures that affect our ability to test present and future CMOS ICs. While parametric failures are widely reported, we seek to classify these failures with supporting data. Solutions to this complex test problem require that we structure and formalize their behaviors. Data indicate that multiparameter test strategies have the best match to some of the failures while good test strategies do not exist for others.

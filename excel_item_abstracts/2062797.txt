Tuberculosis is a zoonotic infection disease caused by Mycobacterium bacteria. The causative agent of bovine tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, is a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex which is the causative agent of human tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is an important disease of ruminants especially cattle and goats throughout the world and Iran. A part from humans and ruminants, tuberculosis also infects companion and wild animals; therefore its control is difficult. Dogs and cats are susceptible to human, bovine and avian tuberculosis bacteria and transmission of disease from dogs and cats to humans and livestock is easily accomplished. Domestic birds like the canary are also susceptible to the aforementioned bacteria and therefore have an important role in the hygienic control of humans and livestock. A part from the role of livestock and companion animals in the transmission of tuberculosis, the spread of immunosuppressive diseases like AIDS which is increasing rapidly in our country, have a major role in the outbreak of human tuberculosis. The causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) is an important source of infection and disease transmission to humans therefore the control and eradication of tuberculosis in bovine population has always been out of the priorities of the relevant tuberculosis like the Veterinary organization of our country.

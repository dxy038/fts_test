This paper describes the education and improved curricular content of computer networking and communications courses through the introduction of hands-on ATM and wireless network programming to students. The authorsÂ´ institutions are in the process of establishing two laboratories to teach advanced computer networking. Traditional computer networking courses primarily tend to provide students with hands-on software development and network performance experience with TCP/IP networks. These labs plan to enhance the expertise of students through introducing next-generation networks. In particular, projects and experiments based on ATM networks and wireless networks will be introduced, both of which are increasingly important technologies in the industries students hope to join. The objective is to prepare the students for both industry and advanced graduate research. Two different approaches will be used to teach practical advanced networking concepts. At WSU, a project-based approach will be used where the students focus on writing software applications using the ATM and wireless application programming interface (API). A&amp;T will follow an experiment-based approach where each course will typically involve two hours of theory and two hours laboratory work

In this research, after simulating the Abadan refinery?s atmospheric distillation unit 75 by using Aspen Hysys 3.2 software, optimization is done using simulator data and Design Expert &Matlabsoftwares for decreasing the residue product, then results and parameters are analyzed and results which obtained from optimization will be ran in model with three different amount of feed rate. The effects of six operating parameters on the percentage of residue production were investigated. These parameters were further optimized by response surface analysis according to the principles of central composite design (CCD), with the minimization of residue percent as the objective. and a mathematical model for the correlation of percentage of residue production and operating parameters was established in the optimization

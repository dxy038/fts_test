For better guiding a system, senior managers should have accurate information. Using Data Envelopment
analysis (DEA) help managers in this objective. Thus, many investigations have been made in
order to find the most productive scale size (MPSS) for the evaluating decision making units (DMUs).
In this paper we consider this case where there exist subsets of input and output variables to be integer
valued. We use data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique, which is a mathematical programming
for eficiency evaluation and target setting for a set of DMUs, and develop a model with which the
desired MPSS point can be found. The applicability of developed model is illustrated in the context
of the analysis to show the validity of the proposed model.

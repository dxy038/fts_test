Hypothesis The use of a material made of bacterial cellulose with the aim of obtaining vocal fold medialization has not hitherto been fully investigated. Although the material has been tested in other animal models, the evaluation did not include the larynx; hence, situations, such as tissue reaction, material absorption, and extrusion, need to be addressed to evaluate its usefulness as a material for laryngeal reconstruction. Objective To evaluate the medialization, tissue response, and healing of rabbit vocal folds, after the implantation of a membrane of bacterial cellulose. Study Design Experimental study. Methods A total of 32 rabbits were used, two of which were used to check out the adequacy of the implant location. The animals were followed for 4 months and grouped according to follow-up times of 2, 4, and 16 weeks. All test animals received an implant of bacterial cellulose in one vocal fold and the injection of distilled water in the other, both performed by videoendoscopic cervicotomy. At the end of the follow-up, the presence of inflammatory and medial displacement was evaluated. Results No statistically significant difference in the inflammatory parameters between the study and control vocal folds or among follow-up times was found. All animals receiving cellulose presented medial displacement of vocal folds, and all retained this material at the implant site up to study endpoint. Conclusion Bacterial cellulose is a useful material for laryngeal medialization, showing no signs of rejection or absorption.

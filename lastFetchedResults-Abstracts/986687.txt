The objective of the present study was to evaluate muscle fiber characteristics in Pectoralis profundus between native and broiler chickens. 20 adult Ross broilers and 20 adult native chickens of both sexes (20 each sex) were used. Tissue samples were taken from the middle parts of both sides of Pectoralis profundus muscle and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The results showed that the sex related difference was observed only in the mean muscle fibre diameters of the right side of Pectoralis profundus muscle of native chickens. No evident difference between the left and right sides of Pectoralis profundus muscle was observed in the characteristics of muscle fibres in both broilers and native chickens. In the broiler, the mean muscle fibre diameters of the both sides of Pectoralis profundus muscle were more in the female, but in the native chickens were more in the males. The mean muscle fiber diameters in various sides of Pectoralis profundus muscle in native chickens varied between 34.5-44.5 ?m and in Ross broilers: between 35-39.5 ?m. There were no significant differences for the total number of muscle fibres of Pectoralis profundus muscle in both broiler and native chickens. The mean muscle fiber numbers in native chickens ranged from 70.7%-81.3%, whereas in broilers ranged from 61.3%-72%. It is concluded that unlike other species, fast growing Ross broilers had not pectoralis profundus muscle fibres three to five times wider than slower growing native chickens.

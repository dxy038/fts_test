This paper focusses on the design of microstrip antenna which can operate at GPS (Global Positioning System) satellite frequencies in the L-band. The main objective of this work is to design a rectangular antenna with two equal size radiating elements, each operates at a different frequency within the L-band. The Mathcad software is used for computing and correlating the relevant design formulations. Suggestions on suitable thickness of the microwave laminate dielectrics are made and justified. Micropatch and Sonnetlite have been used for the simulation work performed on the designed antennas. The Micropatch software is also able to predict the design dimensions of the specified frequencies with the appropriate feeding technique chosen. The Sonnetlite software is used as alternative simulation on the designed antennas. The antennas are well matched at the input. The most suitable size of the radiating patch is obtained as 38 mm by 51 mm.

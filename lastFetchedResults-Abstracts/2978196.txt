The visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral bidirectional reflectance and albedo of snow and sea ice surface in the Ross Sea were measured during the winter cruise (May to June) of 1998, and the summer cruise (January to February) of 1999. The results of the winter cruise provide patterns of snow surface reflectance under low solar elevation angles, while those of the summer cruise provide patterns of reflectance at intermediate solar zenith angles. Influences of snow grain size, snow wetness, stratigraphy, ice concentration, surface topography, as well as solar elevation angles, on surface spectral directional reflectance and albedo are discussed

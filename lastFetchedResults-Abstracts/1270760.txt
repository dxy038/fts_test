Background: Seafood allergy is potentially severe, but the prevalence of this group of food allergies in Iran, has not been determined. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of seafood allergy in student living in Bushehr and Borazjan.
Materials and Methods: We performed a cross-sectional, random school survey by using a questionnaire in 2012-13. A total of 608 (36% male, and 64%) female) were asked questions about personal and family history of allergies, food and seafood allergy.
Results: The overall prevalence of food allergy was 12% (Total 73 subjects, 69.8% male and 30.2% female), and seafood allergy was 4.4% (Total 27 subjects, 36.6% male, 43.4% female). Fish allergy (1.4%) and shrimp and shellfish allergy (3.5%) were reported. The most frequently reported symptoms were skin (49.3%), gastrointestinal (28.7%), and respiratory reactions (2.7%). Seafood allergy was not associated with subjects reporting atopic diseases, significantly (P >  0.05), while the other food allergy was positively associated (P=0.00).
Conclusion: Our study is the first report on prevalence estimates for seafood allergy in Bushehr province. Findings indicated high prevalence of seafood allergy in student, therefore further studies and significant health concern is needed.

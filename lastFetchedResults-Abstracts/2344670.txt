The design of manufacturing copper alloys is the objective of the paper. The whole manufacturing chain based on forging is considered. Plastometric tests with various preheating schedules were performed, and rheological models dependent on the material structure were developed. Various manufacturing sequences were considered next. Numerical simulations were performed using CAFE model, and a production schedule, which allows achievement of the required properties and minimum tool wear, was selected. Industrial experiments were performed and the designed technology was validated. Experimental results confirmed correctness of the developed technology.

Objective
estigate the association between depressive symptoms and physical functioning in pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients.
s
two patients diagnosed with precapillary or postcapillary PH completed self-report questionnaires of depressive symptoms and physical functioning. Cardiac catheterization reports of patients were reviewed for hemodynamic variables.
s
al functioning was significantly associated with depressive symptoms on bivariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, after controlling for demographic and hemodynamic variables, depressive symptoms accounted for 9% of variance in physical functioning.
sion
sociation of depressive symptoms with decreased physical functioning in PH patients indicates the need for longitudinal research regarding the possible effect of depression on disease outcomes in this population.

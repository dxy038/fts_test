This paper analyzes and discusses topology of two-stage PFC converters, and the objective of the research in this paper is to study the development of new converter topology that AC/DC two-stage PFC schemes to produce new class of AC-DC converter with high performance and higher efficiency and increased reliability. This is achieved by analysis, design and circuit experiments, as well as combining the advantages of existing single-stage and two-stage AC/DC converters.

Objectives
The main objective is the characterisation of the setting reaction in glass ionomer cements based on experimental ionomer glasses with different fluorine content and a commercial glass ionomer cement liquid by using 13C CP/MAS-NMR, 29Si, 27Al and 31P MAS-NMR spectroscopy in order to receive information specifically about the cross-linking process.
Methods

Different fluorine containing glass compositions based on 4.5SiO2–3Al2O3–1.5P2O5–(5 − z)CaO–zCaF2 where z = 0–3, were mixed with a commercially available polymer liquid to form glass ionomer cements. The cements were subjected to 27Al, 13C CP/MAS, 29Si, and 31P MAS-NMR analysis.
Results

: The 27Al spectra showed clearly the formation of six-fold coordinate Al(VI), that may crosslink the carboxyl groups in the poly-acid molecules. A shift towards to more positive values of the carboxyl peak in the 13C CP/MAS-NMR spectra showed clearly the proton dissociation of the carboxyl groups. A shift towards more negative values was observed in the 29Si MAS-NMR spectra, suggesting formation of hydrated silica gel and consequently formation of additional Si–O–Si bonds. 31P MAS-NMR spectra also reflected changes in the coordination state around a PO43− tetrahedron. Increasing the fluorine content of the glasses resulted generally in increased reactivity during setting, due to promoting cross-linking and repolymerisation of the silicate phase, followed by clear changes in the MAS-NMR spectra.
Conclusions

: The cross-linking process during the setting reaction of glass ionomer cements can be followed by MAS-NMR spectroscopy observing the conversion of Al(IV) to Al(VI). The acid base setting reaction is completed in 1 day and no further significant changes in the MAS-NMR spectra can be observed. Further study is required in order to understand the role of phosphorus.

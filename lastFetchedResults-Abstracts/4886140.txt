This work is motivated by the importance that is given to multimodal applications. In this kind of application, a very important aspect is the possibility of concomitant use of multiple devices provided by the fusion of interactive events. Thus the main goal of this study is to determine, through users tests and capture of objective and subjective variables, if the multimodal interaction is providing a better exploitation of parallelism during the execution of selection and navigation tasks in a 3D environment.

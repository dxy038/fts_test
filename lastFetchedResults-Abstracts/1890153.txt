Objective: Every cell type is characterized by a specific transcriptional profile together
with a unique epigenetic landscape. Reprogramming factors such as Oct4, Klf4, Sox2
and c-Myc enable somatic cells to change their transcriptional profile and convert them to
pluripotent cells. Small molecules such as BIX-01294, Bay K8644, RG-108 and valproic
acid (VPA) are reported as effective molecules for enhancing induction of pluripotency
in vitro, however, their effects during in vivo reprogramming are addressed in this experimental
study.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, Oct4 expressing lentiviral particles
and small molecules BIX-01294, Bay K8644 and RG-108 were injected into the right ventricle
of mice brain and VPA was systematically administered as oral gavages. Animals
treated with different combinations of small molecules for 7 or 14 days in concomitant with
Oct4 exogenous expression were compared for expression of pluripotency markers. Total
RNA was isolated from the rims of the injected ventricle and quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was performed to evaluate the expression of endogenous Oct4, Nanog,
c-Myc, klf4 and Sox2 as pluripotency markers, and Pax6 and Sox1 as neural stem cell
(NSC) markers.
Results: Results showed that Oct4 exogenous expression for 7 days induced pluripotency
slightly as it was detected by significant enhancement in expression of Nanog (p < 0.05).
Combinatorial administration of Oct4 expressing vector and BIX-01294, Bay K8644 and
RG-108 did not affect the expression of pluripotency and NSC markers, but VPA treatment
along with Oct4 exogenous expression induced Nanog, Klf4 and c-Myc (p < 0.001). VPA
treatment before the induction of exogenous Oct4 was more effective and significantly
increased the expression of endogenous Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, c-Myc (p < 0.01), Pax6 and
Sox1 (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: These results suggest VPA as the best enhancer of pluripotency among the
chemicals tested, especially when applied prior to pluripotency induction by Oct4.

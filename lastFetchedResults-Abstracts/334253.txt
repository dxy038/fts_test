Purpose
Tuberculosis involvement of the central nervous system continues to represent a serious problem, particularly in developing countries. The aim of this study was to characterize the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of intracranial tuberculoma, a form of neurotuberculosis.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the data of 27 patients with intracranial tuberculomas. These consisted of 17 women and 10 men with a mean age of 26 years (14â€“51). MRI was performed on all patients.
Results
A total of 64 tuberculomas were found in these patients, of which 41 were distributed in the cerebral hemispheres, 17 in the cerebellar hemispheres, and 6 in the brainstem. Accompanied meningitis was detected in three patients, hydrocephalus in five patients, and hydrocephalus with meningitis in one patient.
Conclusion
MRI makes a significant contribution to diagnosis of intracranial tuberculomas and can objectively determine accompanying abnormalities.

Objective
We evaluated the association of different genotypes in C161→T substitution in exon 6 of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) gene with bone turnover markers, bone mineral density (BMD), and serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) in female subjects to reveal the role of PPARγ in bone.
Study design
In 263 healthy Korean women (mean age 52 years), anthropometric measurements were taken along with measurements of lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD, bone turnover markers, such as alkaline phosphatase, serum calcium, phosphorus, 24-hour urine calcium, phosphorus excretion, and urine deoxypyridinoline. Serum follicular stimulating hormone levels were measured and serum OPG levels were measured with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was performed.
Results
Allele frequencies were 0.804 for the C allele and 0.196 for the T allele. There were no differences in mean age, body mass index, BMD, and bone turnover markers among different genotypes, and the subjects with T alleles had significantly lower serum OPG levels. There were no differences in the prevalence of metabolic bone diseases according to the genotypes. When analyzed according to the menopausal status, only postmenopausal subjects with T alleles showed significantly lower serum OPG levels.
Conclusion
The frequencies of C161→T substitution in exon 6 of the PPARγ gene in Korean females were similar to other races and women with T alleles showed significantly lower serum OPG levels and it was especially noted for postmenopausal subjects, which supports the possible concurrent association of PPARγ and OPG with estrogen status in female subjects.

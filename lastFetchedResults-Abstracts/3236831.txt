The main objective in of this paper is to emphasize the importance of Smart Grid as a potential source for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, through mechanisms that may directly to the energy efficiency and in the integration of renewable energy generation, making a short quantification of the benefits provided by the reduction of these gases and therefore a reduction in final energy consumption.

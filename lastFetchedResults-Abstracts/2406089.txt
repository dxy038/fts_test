We present the results of a seismic refraction experiment conducted off eastern Aomori, northeastern Japan forearc region, where the detailed crustal structure was poorly known. An objective analysis using high-quality survey data allowed us to obtain the seismic velocity structure to about 30 km depth, and in particular, to obtain a well-constrained geometry of the plate boundary in the source region of the 1994 Sanriku-oki earthquake. Our results show that the subducting Pacific oceanic plate increases its dip from about 5째 to approximately 15째 around the longitude of 143.5째 E, 80 km landward of the trench axis near the latitude of 40째 N. The location of this bend in the plate is 40 km east of the bending point previously proposed on the basis of hypocenter distribution. A cluster of aftershocks of the 1994 Sanriku-oki earthquake occurred around the bending point. This is because the bending of the subducting plate appears to affect the stress state in the vicinity of the plate boundary. Furthermore, the plate geometry is also considered to be related to the coupling or slip features along the plate boundary as the bending point correlates with the spatial distribution of repeating earthquakes. Our results will lead to more reliable determinations of asperity areas because an accurate dip angle of the fault plane is necessary for slip distribution studies.

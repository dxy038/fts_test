Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the activity and toxicity of carboplatin and paclitaxel (taxol) in the treatment of advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.
Study design
This was a retrospective review of 18 consecutive patients with advanced (stage 4) or recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma that had been treated with outpatient carboplatin and taxol. Taxol was delivered at 135 mg/m2 over 3 hours, and carboplatin was delivery at an area under the curve of 5 over 1 hour. Cycles were repeated every 21 days.
Results
The overall response rate was 63% with 28% of patients who had a partial response and 35% of patients who had a complete response. Kaplan-Meier test was used to estimate the median survival time of 27 months and the median progression free survival time of 24 months. No patient had neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or grade 3 vomiting, neurosensory toxicity, or renal toxicity.
Conclusion
Carboplatin and taxol for the treatment of advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer appear to be active regimens with minimal toxicity.

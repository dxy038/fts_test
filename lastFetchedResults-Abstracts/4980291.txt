Although single die eWLB has been around for quite some time, processing of multi-die packages can pose many challenges. In multi-die eWLB package, two or more dies are placed side by side with a small gap, encapsulated by mold compound and interconnected with redistributed layers (RDL) and solder balls. The objective of this paper is to share the challenges in processing multi-die eWLB packages, potential solutions, key processes, results of die position measurements, mold filling, construction analysis, package level and board level reliability tests.

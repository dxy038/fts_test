The practical properties of nine types of 1.3-&#956;m Fabry-Perot laser modules were determined so as to construct a bidirectional transmission system. Time compression multiplexing (TCM) transmission is employed and the modules must act as both transmitter and receiver. Many modules are tested and it is found that the responsivity of a laser module is roughly proportional to the moduleÂ´s output power. The main source of variation in responsivity is determined to be due to coupling effects. Optical characteristics are measured over the range -15 to +65&#176;C. The maximum transmission distance for narrow-band ISDN (integrated services digital network) services over single-mode fibers is determined for a bit rate of 3.5 Mb/s

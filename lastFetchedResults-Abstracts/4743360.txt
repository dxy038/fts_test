A scheme of variable bit rate video coding for ATM networks is proposed in this paper. A two-layer coding method of image sequences using the wavelet transform (WT) over a VBR network is given, and, the statistical multiplexing gain of the WT coding scheme over ATM B-ISDN networks is also computed. The computing simulation results of the mean SNR and the mean data compression rate of reconstructed images with WT show that the subjective and the objective qualities of reconstructed images the using proposal coding scheme are satisfied

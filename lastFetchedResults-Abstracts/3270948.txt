Selecting the right suppliers and order allocation has an important role in reducing the cost of production and thereby improving customer satisfaction. In the real world may not access to accurate information for evaluating suppliers that this causes the lack of decision making credit. Also the objectives are often in conflict with each other. Therefore, in this paper is proposed a multi - objective fuzzy - probabilistic programming model with discount, time value of money, and inflation. In order to solve the model, two algorithms solution is proposed. Finally, a numerical instance is used to show the performance of the proposed algorithms.

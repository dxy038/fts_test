The objective of this paper is to establish understanding of the single/multimode oscillator circuits used in combiners. A model is developed with emphasis on the selection and realization of the input/output coefficients, optimum stabilizing and output loads, equalizing network synthesis, and other cogent features. The application of this theory to the highly successful and efficient design of J-band pulsed oscillators will be discussed.

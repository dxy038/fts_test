BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to present an objective method based on support vector
machines (SVMs) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) which is initially utilized for
recognition the pattern among risk factors and hypertension (HTN) to stratify and analysis
HTNâ€™s risk factors in an Iranian urban population.
METHODS: This community-based and cross-sectional research has been designed based on the
probabilistic sample of residents of Isfahan, Iran, aged 19 years or over from 2001 to 2007. One
of the household members was randomly selected from different age groups. Selected
individuals were invited to a predefined health center to be educated on how to collect 24-hour
urine sample as well as learning about topographic parameters and blood pressure
measurement. The data from both the estimated and measured blood pressure [for both systolic
blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] demonstrated that optimized SVMs
have a highest estimation potential.
RESULTS: This result was particularly more evident when SVMs performance is evaluated with
regression and generalized linear modeling (GLM) as common methods. Blood pressure risk
factors impact analysis shows that age has the highest impact level on SBP while it falls second
on the impact level ranking on DBP. The results also showed that body mass index (BMI) falls
first on the impact level ranking on DBP while have a lower impact on SBP.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that salt intake could efficiently influence both DBP and
SBP with greater impact level on SBP. Therefore, controlling salt intake may lead to not only
control of HTN but also its prevention.

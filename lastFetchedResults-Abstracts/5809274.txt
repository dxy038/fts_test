To meet the peak power demands of aircraft electric loads such as actuators and avionic systems, and to absorb regenerated power, an ultracapacitor-based energy storage system is examined in which a bidirectional dual active bridge DC-DC converter is used. Analysis is performed for the DAB converter producing equations for the device RMS and average currents and the peak and RMS currents in the coupling inductor. The operation of the DAB DC-DC converter has been verified through extensive simulations, confirming the accuracy of the analysis. Experimental results are included to support the analysis for 7kW, 390/180V, 20 kHz operating conditions.

The work in this paper involves exploring the potential of using the LEGO programmable robotics products in school to instill engineering skills, scientific interests, computer acquisition, general ideas and creativity among students. The second objective is to propose a curricular program that covers guidelines for educators, scope of activities to be organized and how to relate the curricular program to machinery and automation in real life. Further to the second objective, the paper also discusses the possible interaction and collaboration between schools and the technological establishments for such a program. Learning technology the traditional classroom way could be dull and less appealing to students. Adding some interactive methods in the teaching process can be as fun as a field trip to a nuclear plant and fruitful too. LEGO Mindstroms/sup TM/ is a range of revolutionary programmable robotics products that opens up a whole new perspective in bringing affordable, motivational and interactive learning to adults and children. Mindstorms is so versatile that the limit to what can be done with the robotics kit is only limited by the creativity of the user. Part of the paper includes work reports. The reports include: survey on students and teachers regarding their interest in robotics, preference in alternative learning methods, and understanding of robotics at school level; observation of past robotics events; and feedback from an ongoing pilot program based on the proposed model.

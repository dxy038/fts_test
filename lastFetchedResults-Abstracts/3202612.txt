The Smart Vehicle-to-Grid Project at INESC TEC is currently studying the application of matrix converters to implement an isolated bidirectional AC-DC power converter using a single power conversion stage to provide a high-frequency link between the grid and vehicle. The single-stage structure and bidirectional power flow make the matrix converter an attractive solution for the charging applications of electric vehicles. A very brief overview of the matrix converter and its modulation strategy is presented, followed by detailed analysis. The power conversion system performance is investigated in terms of the switching commutation, input filter and input power factor. Simulations and experimental results of a prototype are also presented to further validate the proposed topology and operating principle.

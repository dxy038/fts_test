Operation optimization of the reservoirs has been mostly carried out based on general objectives, including
water demand supplies, power generation, flood management, and environmental constraints. In most
of the previously developed models, sediment removal from reservoirs has not been included. Flushing is
one of the most important and common ways of retrieving the lost volume of reservoirs due to sedimentation.
Despite its adverse effects on the environment of downstream rivers, this method has received lots of
attention by engineers and researchers in the past. One of the main drawbacks of the previous studies in
the field of reservoir operation optimization has been lack of modeling tools for considering the relation
between sediment removal and other objectives of reservoir operation. In this paper, a new approach has
been developed for monthly reservoir operation optimization. For this purpose, a model has been formulated
to minimize the total deficit in supplying demands and to maximize the total volume of sediment
removed from the reservoir. The objective function for sediment outflow has been developed using the
flushing method. The optimization model has been formulated using Varying chromosome Length Genetic
Algorithm (VLGA). The efficiency of the model has been tested in the case study of Sefidrud Reservoir in
North of Iran. The results of the optimization model for a 5-year period have been compared with the historical
records of the operation of the reservoir. The results of the case study have been summarized in the
form of practical operating rules for flushing and operation management.

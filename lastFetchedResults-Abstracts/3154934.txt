It is a complex optimization system to elevator group control system (EGCS) with multi-objective, stochastic and nonlinear characteristics. It is hard to describe EGCS with exact mathematic model and to increase the capability of the system with traditional control method. The fuzzy control technology and neural network technology are combined in this paper and a dispatching method applied to various passenger traffic conditions is proposed. The comprehensive evaluation function of traffic signal is established and the right heavy of every evaluation factor (waiting time, riding time, energy consume, crowd degree) is studied by the neural network, so the elevator is dispatched optimally. The result of simulation shows that this method realizes reasonable elevator dispatching under various passenger traffic conditions and indicates the validity of this method.

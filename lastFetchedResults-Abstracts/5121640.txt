Call Admission Control (CAC) schemes based on guard channel are widely used to protect handoff calls for seamless wireless services. In this paper, we propose a guard channel based CAC scheme where new calls arrive in batches. A fixed number of guard channels are reserved for handoff calls. The main objective of our proposed scheme is to alleviate the new call blocking probability due to guard channels while it can still protect handoff calls. We develop and analyze a performance model and the explicit expression for steady-state distribution of system using a recursive approach is presented. Some performance measures and a variety of numerical results in the form of graphs are discussed.

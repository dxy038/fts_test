The objective of this study is to extend the applicability of a Peng–Robinson group contribution method (PRASOG), which combines a zero pressure gE mixing rule for Peng–Robinson EOS with ASOG group contribution model, to polymer solutions. The solvent activities in polymer solutions have been predicted by PRASOG-FV which evaluates the gE from ASOG-FV proposed previously in order to predict the solvent activities in polymer solutions using ASOG group pair parameters. The systems discussed in this study are nine binary systems composed of six solvents (benzene, toluene, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate) and four polymers (polystyrene, poly(ethylene oxide), poly(propylene oxide), poly(vinyl acetate)). The temperature range is 298.15 to 361.25 K. The accuracy using PRASOG-FV is almost comparable to those with ASOG-FV and UNIFAC-FV.

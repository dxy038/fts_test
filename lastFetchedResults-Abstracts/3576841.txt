The principal objective of the Radio Noise Section at the National Bureau of Standards is the establishment of a regular service for predicting the levels and characteristics of radio noise. The various steps necessary to establish such a service at NBS are summarized. The characteristics of atmospheric noise vary with location, frequency, and time, and methods of dealing with these variations are discussed. Also discussed are new predictions of world-wide noise levels which have been prepared for the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR).

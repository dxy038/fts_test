Objective
This study was undertaken to characterize the neuroimaging findings of cerebral edema associated with eclamptic seizures by use of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Study design
During the 3-year period ending March 2002, 27 nulliparous women with eclampsia were evaluated with diffusion-weighted MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient mapping. Those with findings of restricted diffusion suggestive of cytotoxic edema underwent neuroimaging again 6 weeks post partum.
Results
All but 2 of these 27 women (93%) had reversible vasogenic edema. Six were also found to have areas of cytotoxic edema consistent with cerebral infarction. Five of these 6 women had persistent imaging findings of infarction when studied post partum, however, without clinical neurologic deficits.
Conclusion
The spectrum of cerebral lesions in eclampsia as seen with MRI varies from initially reversible areas of vasogenic edema that may progress to cytotoxic edema and infarction in up to a fourth of women.

The objective of this study was to assess factors associated with the diet quality of brazilian
older adults. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: City of Carlos Barbosa, Brazil. Participants: 228
participants aged 60 and older. Measurements: A questionnaire with questions on socioeconomic and behavioral
variables and health characteristics was used. The body mass index was calculated and the waist circumference
was measured to provide information in respect to abdominal fat accumulation. Dietary data were collected via
24-hour recall and the diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index, an instrument that attributes
scores to the diet according to the adequacy of intake of the main food and nutrient groups. Participants were
divided into three categories, according to the Healthy Eating Index scores: under 51 - poor diet; between 51 and
80 - diet that needs improvement; over 80 - good diet. The evaluation employed the analysis of variance, t test
and non-conditional logistic regression to assess the association between the Healthy Eating Index and the other
variables. Results: Most participants (80.9%) presented diet that needs improvement and the marital status
showed an independent association with the Healthy Eating Index - married individuals showed higher odds of
presenting good diet. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that, in general, the diet quality of this group
needs improvement and that the marital status is a factor that can be considered for the development of activities
to promote health and healthy food intake habits

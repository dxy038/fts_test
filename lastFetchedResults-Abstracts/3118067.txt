Pipeline robot is a research hotspot in pipeline industry, as the same as research and application in petroleum pipeline .Because that the condition is special in downhole, the performance of downhole crawling robot is different from general pipeline robot. This paper introduces downhole crawling robot, key technology on driving unit Downhole crawling robot can adapt to holes of different diameter by improved driving unit, and add bidirectional spring jar to improving the working properties of downhole crawling robot .Finally combining the development survey of petroleum industry and related technology, giving summary of research and prospect about downhole crawling robot.

This paper solves the OPF calculation problem through the Variable-Metric Method. In the course of calculation, we construct the augmented objective matrix through Lagrange multiplier method, and carry on one-dimensional searching, the gradient calculation and the identity matrix iteration and so on. The computing result shows that the novel method has more advantages than the traditional Newton-Raphson Method.

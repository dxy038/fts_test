In the absence of reliable live animal tests for the presence of BSE in cattle, a number of measures have been applied to exclude specified risk materials (SRM) from the human food chain. However, concerns remain that current practices in the stunning and slaughter of cattle may disseminate central nervous system (CNS) tissue to meat and meat contact surfaces. The objective of this study was to establish the particular risks of CNS tissue dissemination associated with captive bolt stunning and carcass splitting. The study applied enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in the detection and quantification of two CNS proteins, syntaxin 1b and GFAP. The study observed extensive dispersal of both CNS proteins onto equipment, beef hide and personnel. These results demonstrate that despite the rigorous application of current SRM control policies, normal slaughter practices continue to present significant opportunities for CNS material including BSE prion present in the CNS of any sub-clinically infected cattle to contaminate meat entering the human food chain.

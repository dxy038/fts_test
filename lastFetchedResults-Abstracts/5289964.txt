The objective of this study is to identify factors affecting adequacy of haemodialysis and relations between them using Taguchi Method (fractional factorial experiments) in order to be able to reach meaningful results among used parameters throughout minimum of tests. Dialysis age, dialyser membrane material, haematocrit, interdialytic weight difference, dialysate, pump speed, heparin type, and socio-economical status were applied as parameters for the Taguchi Method in order to determine out not only their individual effectiveness on the therapy but also interrelations among them. The adequacy of a hemodialysis treatment was decided according to Kt/V using the Daugirdas-2 formula. Delivery of Kt/V of 1.2 was accepted as the target value for the trials. Considering ANOVA calculations, dialyser, haematocrit, pump speed and socio-economical status were found to have direct influence on the treatment quality, while dialyser-interdialytic weight difference, dialyser-haematocrit, dialyser-pump speed, dialyser-socioeconomical status relations were detected as effective

Current state-of-the-art approaches for control of hybrid systems face with two main important challenging problems which are guaranteeing the stability and the computational complexity. In this article a new approach has been proposed to guarantee the closed loop stability of a class of hybrid systems while reducing the complexity of control problem by introducing some level of suboptimality. It has been shown that using contraction constraint on the objective function results in asymptotically stable closed loop system. It has also been described that since only feasibility is sufficient for stability in the proposed approach, suboptimal control could be used to reduce the computational complexity.

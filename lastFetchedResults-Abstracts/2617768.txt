Preheater cyclones in cement industry are mainly used to recover outlet gases heat from kiln and reducing kiln length. The particle collection efficiency of the preheater cyclones of Kerman cement plant is partly low. In this study, one of the twin cyclones of preheater in the last stage that had the most important in separation of particles was investigated. The effect of three dimensions of the preheater cyclone (i.e. height of vortex finder, height of cylindrical part and conical diameter) on the performance of cyclone (i.e. pressure drop and efficiency) was studied using design of experiment and computational fluid dynamics. Two equations for Euler number and cyclone efficiency were derived by using multi-gene genetic programming. Two-objective optimization was performed a

The objective of this paper is to implementa tic-tac-toe solving using robot. The implementation of the scheme has been done with NXT Lego Mind storms kit. Robot is designed to scan a 3&#215;3 grid matrix with the help of a light sensor to identify cells after every move taken by the opponent. With the opponent´s move, robot starts scanning all the empty as well as non-empty cells once again. After the identification of the opponent´s mark present in the non-empty cell, the microcontroller executes the predefined algorithm so as to detect the move that has to be made by the robot. All the moves that have been made by the opponent as well as by the robot are displayed on NXT Lego screen. The provision for moving arm of the robot is provided to write every move on the paper by itself using a ball point pen. Finally using this proposed scheme, the robot scans and computes all the moves to write the solution on paper in order to win or tie the game.

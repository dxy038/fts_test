Background: Zataria multiflora is medical plants in Traditional Medicine of Iran. It is necessary to study on antimicrobial effects of essential oil on foodborne pathogens. Nisin is bacteriocin, antimicrobial food preservative. It is regarded as natural because it is a polypeptide produced by certain strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (hereafter referred to as L. lactis), during fermentation.
Objective: This study was performed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of Zataria multiflora Boiss essential oil and Nisin on the shelflife of light salted fish fillet, silver carp.
Methods: Effects of different concentrations, Zataria multiflora Boiss essential oil (0, 0.045, 0.135, 0.405 and 0.810%) and Nisin (0, 0.25 ?g/ml) were studied on shelf life in light salted fish fillets of silver carp at unfavourable refrigeration storage temperature (10oC) by measuring of microbial flora and chemical values such as pH, thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) and perioxide compared with control group. 
Results: The results showed that higher used concentrations of Zataria multiflora essential oil (0.135, 0.405 and 0.810%) and Nisin (0.25%) had a significant effect on the shelf life of fish fillets (p >  0.05).
Conclusion: The results showed that Z. multiflora essential oil and nisin have antimicrobial effects and are as a food natural preservative in fish fillet. Also, Total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) increased with growth of microbial flora and TVN in the study was best factor for shelf life changes.

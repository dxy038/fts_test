Genetic algorithms are often well suited for multi-objective optimization problems. The paper reviews the methods for generating Pareto optimal solutions in bilateral negotiations. A method is put forward for generating Pareto solutions using multi-objective genetic algorithms; software is developed with Visual C++. Through a simulation study the method is proven to be practical and effective.

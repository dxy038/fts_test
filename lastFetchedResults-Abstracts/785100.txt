Objective: To observe the effect of prolonged feeding of dietary nucleotides (nTs), and to clarify the
effect of nTs on life extension of Sprague-Dawley rats. Methods: There were 50 Sprague-Dawley rats in each
group (male:female ratio=1:1), which were fed diets supplemented with nTs at concentrations of 0%, 0.01%,
0.04%, 0.16% and 0.64% (wt/wt) from the age of 4 weeks until natural death. We investigated the moribundity
and mortality, survival time, spontaneous tumor incidence, and serum oxidative status. Results: nTs have
significantly influence body weight of first 3 month old and food consumption of male rats throughout the life
span; it did dose-dependently inhibit the age-related decrease in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the agerelated
increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation product in both sexes. nTs notably increased the mean life
span, and the maximal life span. Compared to the control group, the incidence of death from tumors was
decreased in nTs groups of both sexes. Conclusions: Long-term feeding of nTs could dose-dependently increase
life span in Sprague-Dawley rats, especially, the tumor-bearing ones. Moreover, the antioxidative property of
nTs may be responsible for the increased life span

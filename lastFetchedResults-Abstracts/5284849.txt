Aim of this paper is to present a decision support system designed to optimize the transport of hazardous materials. Various parameters have to be in-depth analyzed for handling this kind of transport. Traditional systems, based on multi-objective functions optimization, have serious limits regarding the scalability both of the considered parameters and the number of vehicles involved into transport. The transport of hazardous material is regulated by specific rules in many countries. The system presented in this work was developed by the authors in the framework of a research project funded by Regione Puglia (Italy). In this work the authors present the adopted intelligent multi-agent system architecture focusing the attention on the proposed decision support system based on the multi agent cooperative negotiation.

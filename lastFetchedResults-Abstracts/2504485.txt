Background: Addition of amino acids to the culture medium is beneficial for embryonic
development in many species.
Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of amino acids on the in vitro
maturation and embryonic development of the bovine oocyte.
Materials and Methods: Bovine ovaries were collected from a local abattoir and brought into
laboratory. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs; n=1212) were aspirated from follicles (2-8 mm in
diameter) and randomly assigned to four groups for maturation in culture: (1) Basic medium alone
as control; (2) Basic medium supplemented with 2% MEM essential amino acids solution; (3) Basic
medium supplemented with 1% MEM non-essential amino acids solution; and (4) Basic medium
supplemented with 2% MEM essential amino acids solution + 1% MEM non-essential amino acids
solution. COCs were incubated in 1 ml maturation medium in an Organ culture dish at 38.5Â°C in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 with high humidity. After 24 h of culture, 372 oocytes were fixed to
determine maturation rate and the remaining oocytes were used for in vitro fertilization (IVF).
Following 18 h of insemination, 437 oocytes were fixed and examined for fertilization and 403
oocytes were further cultured.
Results: There were no differences in maturation rates and penetration rates among the four groups.
Although oocyte cleavage rates were not different in the four groups, embryo development up to the
8-cell stage and blastocyst were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in Group (2) and (4) than in the
Control and Group (3).
Conclusion: These results indicate that the presence of amino acids, especially essential amino
acids in the maturation medium is beneficial to oocyte cytoplasmic maturation and subsequent early
embryo development in vitro.

The total number of EPB-TBMs, utilized for tunneling between
2005 and 2010, is estimated to be approximately 350 units
worldwide. One of the most critical adverse conditions is when
encountering abrasive soils and excessive wear on the cutting
tools and the cutter head as reported in many EPB tunneling
projects across the world. In the tunneling project of line 7 of
Tehran metro, the number of cutting tools, needed to be replaced, has been 1169 including 654 rippers,
357 scrapers and 153 disc cutters. In this paper, the influence of geological parameters and operational
factors on the tool wear is examined. The objective of this research is to investigate tool wear on EPB
machines through a case study and field measurements. This refers to assessment of the fundamental
reasons for increases of TBM tool wear in certain ground conditions to find a correlation between
geological conditions and operational parameters with cutter life in soft ground tunneling. This paper
investigates the cutter life parameters as observed in this project and presents results from TBM operation
and soil properties and their influences on the tool wear. The results of this study show that by increasing
TBM thrust, earth pressure and torque, the cutter consumption generally increases. Moreover, soil
conditioning plays an important role in controlling the cutter wear, so that the tool wear can be reduced
even in coarse-grained soils by improving the soil conditioning parameters.

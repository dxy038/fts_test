In a wireless multi-hop network between a source node (S) and a destination node (D), multipath routing in which S redundantly sends the same packets to D through multiple routes at the same time is effective for enhancing the reliability of the wireless data transmission by means of route diversity. However, when applying the multipath routing to a factory where huge robots are moving around, if closer multiple routes are selected, the probability that they are blocked by the robots at the same time becomes higher, so the reliability in terms of packet loss rate cannot be enhanced. This paper proposes a multipath routing method which can select physically distant multiple routes without any knowledge on the locations of nodes. Maximizing the metric composed of "the distance between routes" and "the route quality" by means of scalarization in multi-objective maximization problem, the proposed method can adaptively control the topologies of selected routes between S and D.

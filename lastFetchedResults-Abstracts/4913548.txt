The CODIT (Code Division Testbed) project is a research project within the European RACE programme that has the objective to explore the potential of CDMA as an access method for a third generation mobile telephone system. The main activities of the project are: to establish an advanced system concept based on CDMA including an advanced radio interface and an advanced radio subsystem architecture; to design and build a system demonstrator (testbed) comprising test mobile stations, radio base stations, a radio network controller and a channel simulator; and to validate the system concept in laboratory and field tests, as well as with simulations. The results shall be used to improve the concept and to compare with other radio access techniques. The project duration is from February 1992 to September 1995

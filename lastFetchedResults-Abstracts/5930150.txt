Traffic related problems continue to be one of the biggest problem faced by the people of current century. Caused by the increasing traffic demand, it has become necessary to monitor, control and manage the traffic control system using an intelligent tools. The problem is multi objective as parameters such as speed, traffic density, road condition need to be considered. Here we propose a multi objective Traffic prediction using Type-2 fuzzy and Ambient intelligence Extension as decision support system . Because Type-2 fuzzy is a effective means for handling long term uncertainties. In this paper It is shown how the large amount data measured at a cross section on a freeway can be reduced by means of the Fourier transform and how it is nevertheless possible to obtain a very good representation of the traffic.

We propose a new method for the interpolation of full high definition (HD) image based on the adaptive directional wavelet transform (ADWT). The ADWT is the lifting implementation of wavelet transform and is able to transform an image along diagonal orientation as well as conventional horizontal and vertical orientations. In the proposed method the high-frequency sub band images are obtained by ADWT and the input image are interpolated, followed by combining these all images to generate a new interpolated image by using the inverse ADWT. Simulation results demonstrate that our new interpolation algorithm substantially improves the subjective as well as objective quality of the interpolated images over conventional linear interpolation and edge directed interpolations.

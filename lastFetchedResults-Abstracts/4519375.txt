Renewable sources of energy can be used for water pumping application in rural areas where availability of grid is not there. In this paper, the energy from solar and wind is integrated at a common DC bus which is used to drive the vector controlled induction motor coupled to water pump. A small battery connected through bidirectional dc-dc converter is used to maintain the dc bus at required voltage during the transients occurring in solar or wind conditions. Load torque is calculated according to the power available to the Photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy systems (WES) so as to maintain zero power requirement from the battery during steady state condition. The system is simulated in MATLAB-Simulink environments and the results for different solar insolation and wind speeds are presented.

We consider the problem of traffic grooming in wavelength division multiplexing networks. Our objective is to minimize the required number of electronic add-drop multiplexers. We investigate the problem of efficiently provisioning connections of different bandwidth granularities hi a heterogeneous WDM mesh network through dynamic traffic grooming schemes under traffic engineering principles. We first formulate the problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, and then we derive the optimal solution under all-to-all uniform traffic in WDM ring networks using optimization tools.

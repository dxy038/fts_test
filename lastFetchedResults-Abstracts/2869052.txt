During the last few years, the partial resonant ac-link converters have gained a significant consideration due to their outstanding advantages. Compared to other types of power converters, these ac-link converters are compact in size, reliable, efficient, and they guaranty longer life time and bidirectional power flow. In addition to that, they can be used for dc/ac, ac/dc, ac/ac, or dc/dc applications with multi-phase and/or multi-port operation. Furthermore, they provide buck/boost operations. Due to these merits, this paper will provide an up-to-date review of such converters. Their principle of operation, control, topology modifications and applications will be presented.

A class-aware routing scheme is proposed in this paper for OBS networks providing offset-time-based differentiated services (DiffServ). To unravel the structure of the routing problem, mathematical programming formulations are utilized. An optimization model for two-class OBS networks is presented and studied in particular. The objective is to minimize the burst loss probability over the entire network for both traffic classes. The effectiveness of the routing model is evaluated via illustrative examples based on programming techniques. Numerical results show that compared with traditional class-oblivious routing schemes, class-aware routing further reduces the burst loss probability of multiple classes especially when the network load is light or moderate.

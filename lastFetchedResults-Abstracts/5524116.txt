Active Queue Management (AQM) takes a trade-off between link utilization and delay experienced by data packets. From control point of view, it is rational to regard AQM as a typical regulation system. In this paper, a new fuzzy adaptive second order sliding mode controller is designed for the objective of AQM. In the proposed method, the sliding parameter is adapted using fuzzy logic. Some computer simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control action. Simulation results show the fuzzy logic based adaptive second order sliding mode has better performance in comparison with classic second order sliding mode control action in providing efficient queue management.

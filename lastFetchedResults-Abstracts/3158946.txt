A set of indicator screening method on evaluation index system of new socialist countryside (NSC) is established and its rationality was tested in this paper. First, a preliminary index system containing 44 indicators was put forward concerning farmer, agricultural and rural economic development. Then, combining with a series of subjective and objective indicator screening methods, such as fuzzy synthetic evaluation(FSE), clustering analysis (CA), correlation and variable coefficient analysis, a new index system including 22 indicators was established named the final evaluation index system. The final evaluation index system with weak correlation, independence and completeness of indicators was passed the rationality test and is more scientific, which can be further applied to empirical analysis in Chinese rural areas and the according evaluation results could be a useful reference for NSC reform and development in the whole nation.

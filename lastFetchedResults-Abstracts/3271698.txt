View synthesis technique is important for multi-viewpoint 3D video applications. In our technical investigation, we find that some of the current view synthesis methods perform better in boundary areas while some others in non-boundary areas. For example, MPEG VSRS is the most popular view synthesis software, which integrates a series of advanced tools. Recently, Interval-Based Image Synthesis (IBIS) algorithm is proposed, which shows advantage over MPEG VSRS in non-boundary areas but still has some unpleasant artifacts in boundary areas. To take advantage of the merits of the above methods and overcome their shortcomings, we propose a Hybrid Pixel-block Based View Synthesis(HPBVS) method. Experimental results testify that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art view synthesis methods from both the subjective and objective perspectives.

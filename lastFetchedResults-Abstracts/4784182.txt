In order to help complex productsÂ´ users choose the right supplier, an evaluation model based on ELECTRE method was put forward. In the model, a three-layer architecture, which was composed of overall objective layer, second objective layer, and attribute layer, was set up. Then the weights of individual indicators were determined based on fuzzy AHP method. Subsequently the final result of the evaluation was obtained based on ELECTRE method. At last, a case was used in the model to illustrate its effectiveness.

We have devised a high-quality frequency-domain audio coder based on the state-of-the-art monaural wide-band coder aiming at its use in low-delay and low-bit-rate conditions. The coder efficiently represents frequency spectral envelopes of the target signals with low computational complexity using optimally prepared non-negative sparse matrices. The experimental results reveal that this representation has positive effects on the objective and subjective quality of the coder resulting in the comparable quality to the same bit rate of 3GPP Extended Adaptive Multi-Rate WideBand ( AMR-WB+), a coder which permits more than four times longer delay compared with the proposed coder. Consequently, this coder is suitable for applications in mobile communications, which require low delay and low complexity.

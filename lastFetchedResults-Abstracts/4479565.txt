Recently, the superiority of minimally invasive treatment in endovascular surgery has been advocated. Therefore, VR simulator and silicone blood vessel model simulator have been developed, and practice environment of minimally invasive therapy gets better. However, catheter motion measurement hasn´t been done during the simulations, and we couldn´t know the expert´s strategy and skills of inserting the catheter to the objective nidus. So, there are some difficulties for the beginner to learn the skills of inserting the catheter. For solving this problem, in this research, we proposed the reference area of catheter insertion based on the result of catheter movement inserting in a carotid artery silicone blood vessel model. Reference area of catheter insertion means the insertion success condition obtained from the measurement data of catheter movement, consists of linear and rotational movement. The measurement of catheter insertion was done, and the result show that reference area of catheter insertion of carotid artery silicone blood vessel model is the condition of 70~115deg, 70~80mm. By using this reference area of catheter insertion, beginner of catheter manipulation can insert the catheter to the objective point easily.

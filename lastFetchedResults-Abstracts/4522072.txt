This paper presents an efficient color filter array (CFA) interpolation scheme suitable for single-sensor digital imaging devices. Using interpolation/correction steps in conjunction with a color-difference model and an adaptive edge-sensing mechanism based on the aggregated distances, the method produces excellent objective results, and sharp, visually pleasing color outputs. At the same time, the proposed method outperforms well-known demosaicking solutions in terms of both objective and subjective image quality measures.

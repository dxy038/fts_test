Objective: To compare the response of oxytocin versus prostaglandin E2 vaginal pessary for labour induction in prelabour
rupture of membranes at term in primigravida patients with poor Bishop score.
Design: It was a prospective comparative study.
Setting: The study was conducted in the department of Gynae & Obs, Ittefaq hospital (Trust), Lahore during a period of one
year i.e from July 2007 to June 2008.
Patients and Methods: Fifty primigravidae with prelabour rupture of membranes at term having Bishop score < 5 or 5 were
randomized into 2 groups to undergo induction of labour with either oxytocin or prostaglandin E2 vaginal pessary. Main
outcome measures were induction-initiaton of labour interval, induction-delivery interval, maternal complications during
induction, mode of delivery, fetal outcome and total hospital stay.
Results: The induction-initiation of labour interval (P=0.005), duration of improvement in Bishop score, induction-delivery
interval (P=0.011) and total hospital stay (P=0.018) were shorter in PGE2 induced patients. Moreover, majority of the patients
delivered vaginally, had no maternal complications, did not require augmentation of labour, had less evidence of fetal distress
(P=0.011) and better APGAR score at birth in this group. Majority of the neonates in the 2 groups did not require admission
in neonatology unit (P=0.666).
Conclusion: Prostaglandin E2 vaginal pessaries are very safe and effective to stimulate labour with ruptured membranes and
poor Bishop score.

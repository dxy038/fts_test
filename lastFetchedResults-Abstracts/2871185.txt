During the last years Bluetooth (BT) standard has received increasing acceptance as a prominent communication technology concerning a wide variety of critical applications, posing demanding communication and strict real time constrains. In that respect the main objective of this paper is to offer comprehensive experimental evaluation analyzing BT time constrained performance and critical network parameters. Performance evaluation presented focus on specialized real-time metrics, such as, standard delay deviation, and delay distribution measurements. The study presented, through qualitative and quantitative analysis, reveals significant observations and conclusions. Furthermore, critical trade-offs are presented as far as network conditions are concerned, facilitating optimal network configuration with respect to realistic requirements and parameters posed by critical applications such as medical ones.

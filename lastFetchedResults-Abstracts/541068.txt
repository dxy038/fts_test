Objective: In this research, attractive and repulsive factors of Iranian society in comparison with developed societies, from the viewpoints of high school students of Tehran, have been studied. Immigration is a very complicated process which is correlated to many factors such as cultural, occupational, economic, educational-scientific, political, and even ideological. All above mentioned factors will cause people to leave a geographical and historic background that shape their cultural and social identity and seek to refuge in a different country to live in. Losing elites is not only brain drain in its physical form but also the main problem is formation of idea of escape and an inner tendency to leave the country. At the present conditions, immigration and brain drain have huge economic, political, and cultural expenditures for the country of origin, including our country.

Method: Pre-university students of Tehran have been selected as statistical population. A sample of 800 students selected randomly and their information had been gathered by a questionnaire whose Cronbach's alpha was 86%. Repulsive and attractive factors of origin and destination countries can be categorized as follows: Scientific, Economic, Cultural, Social, and Political, and Managerial factors. Research results show positive view toward emigration, and this tendency is greater among those students whose grade point average and their families' education level are higher.

Background : Post- operation shivering should be treated because it causes harmful side Effects such as increased need for oxygen, tension on suture line, TOP and so on. Objective : To compare IV pethidine with IV clonidine for treatment of post- operation shivering .
Methods : This study was implemented on 60 patients (aged 20-40 years) who belonged to ASA I class. They had a general anesthesia with halothane after a 2-3 hour operation & also severe shivering not treated by rewarming or 02 administration. IV pethidine (25 mg) & IV clonidine (75 mg) were injected to 2 groups of 30 patients (groups A & B) randomly.
Findings: In pethidine group (A) and in clonidine group (B) recovery times were 2.4 & 4.4 minutes respectively (P<0.005). In pethidine group HR & BP was usually stable whereas in clodinine group a drop in HR & BP was sometimes observed. The difference was statistically meaningful.
Conclusion : Because of the fast effect & few side effects of IV pethidine it is recommended as an appropriate method to treat post- operation shivering.

Multi-robot path planning is a typical multi-objective optimization problem with great potential for various applications. This paper presents a novel immune ant colony optimization network algorithm which combines immune network with ant colony optimization to improve the ability of multi-robot system searching the shortest way. A variety of experiments are implemented with different scenarios. The results indicate this approach is very useful for each robot in multi-robot system finding its own appropriate route from the start position to the destination.

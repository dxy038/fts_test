This is Part I of a two paper set dealing with transmission and integrated resource planning. The primary objective of this paper is to report a framework to bring transmission and selected other resources into the sphere of integrated resource planning. Transmission lines and related equipment are indeed a resource, and may constitute either a substitute for other resources (e.g., a strengthened transmission network may reduce the need for remote generation) or a complement to other resources (e.g., additional transmission investment may be needed to facilitate power purchases from a neighboring system or an independent power producer). Moreover, growing competitive pressures make it necessary to plan transmission systems to facilitate competition among alternative generation and demand-side resources. A combined transmission and integrated resource planning model, called the Comprehensive Electrical Systems Planning Model (CESPLAN), is described in this paper

A technique for data compression for a transient recording system is presented. This algorithm is based on adaptive transform coding applied in the segmented voltage or current of the transient recorded data. It uses threshold and zonal sampling to select significant coefficients to represent the original signal. The algorithm of significant coefficient selection is delimited by an imposed segmental signal-to-noise ratio in each segment of the power systems signals. The bit allocation scheme uses a codebook for vectorial classification. Good objective and subjective results were obtained

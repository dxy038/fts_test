Abstract

Objective

Infantile spasms is diagnosed late even by expert pediatricians. Late diagnosis (later than 3 weeks) can have a negative effect on the long-term prognosis. We aimed to investigate infantile spasms treated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse.

Materials & Methods

In this case series study, 20 infants with infantile spasms in 17-Shahrivar Hospital, Rasht, Iran were enrolled. Drugs were administered based on Mytinger protocol that included 3 days of methylprednisolone pulse and 56 days of oral prednisolone. The control of spasms and the omission of hypsarrhythmia in infants follow-up were the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Remission was indicated if the caregivers mentioned no spasms or  > 50% decrease regarding drug initiation for at least 5 consecutive days and the electroencephalography during sleep period noted the omission of hypsarrhythmia.

Results

Eleven female (55%) and 9 male (45%) patients with the mean age of 4.95±1.39 months were enrolled. Mean rapid remission was noted as 4.41±1.50 days. Twelve patients (60%) noted early remission. seizure was controlled in 3(15%) patients completely after 24 months. Five (25%) occasional seizures were noted controlled by routine anticonvulsant drugs after 24 months and 12 (60%) no response was mentioned. Most of the patients (65%) had cryptogenic etiology for infantile spasms. Uncontrolled seizure was mentioned after initial remission.

Conclusion

Methyl prednisolone is an appropriate drug based on easy administering, low cost, and its accessibility.

Effectively the objective evaluation of voice quality, comparative analysis of the MFSC as characteristic parameter of Mel-SD and MFCC for the characteristic parameters of Mel-CD, feature extraction filter structure change of the two measure, and Mel-SD compression factor to be studied. Test studies have shown that, Mel-SD performance is better than Mel-CD also has the robustness of the structural change of the filter banks; Mel-CD is more sensitive to changes in filter structure, with the number of filters in the number of filters for over 13 the increase in performance degradation. Mel-SD in the case given the number of filters, the best compression factor. Within a certain range, the compression factor is not serious. The best compression factor in line with psychoacoustic static measurements of the experimental conclusions of the approximate expression. Parameter Optimization of Mel-CD and Mel-SD for the objective evaluation of the quality of voice communication systems in interference conditions, the results show that the Mel-SD performance is better than Mel-CD and the PESQ performance of the Mel-CD is quite PESQ.

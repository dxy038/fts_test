The sustainability of nuclear power generation is an important objective for world energy development. This goal requires maintaining the option of fast neutron breeder reactors. The main challenge is to have breeder technology ready for the day when massive deployment may be needed. To this purpose, the construction of several prototypes is likely to be insufficient. More extensive operating experience with fast neutron reactors is necessary. This may be achieved by promoting near-term applications of fast neutron reactors, using their remarkable flexibility which makes it possible to burn, store, or breed plutonium. These applications, the CAPRA project and the CAPTURE concept, in addition to accomplishing specific near-term objectives, can yield indispensable experience for reliable future breeder deployment.

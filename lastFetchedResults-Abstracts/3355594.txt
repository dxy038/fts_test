The objective of this study is to examine the status of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) policies in supporting lecturers when providing mobile centric services to students. The research was undertaken as a single case study within the Open and Distance Learning (ODL) context in South Africa. Qualitative data was captured through policy document analysis using the Framework for Qualitative Data Analysis. The findings of the study revealed that UNISA has many policies that guide lecturers when providing mobile centric services to students. The policies cross-reference but some gaps were observed on how the institution provides lecturers with mobile technology infrastructure, technical support, emotional support and pedagogic support. Hence, this study proposes some recommendations on how the policy could support lecturers in providing mobile centric services in teaching and learning.

Background: Management of labor pain is one of the main goals of maternity care. Non-pharmacologic approaches toward this goal are consistent with midwifery care and the method of choice for many women. Midwives have a pivotal role in using different pain relief approaches.
Objective: This study was designed to evaluate the role of education on midwives' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards pain reducing approaches during labor.
Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study carried out at labor wards within the hospitals affiliated to Gilan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Data were collected using a questionnaire confirmed by a panel of experts and test-retest method for its validity and reliability, respectively. A total of 59 midwives were chosen by quota sampling and participated in a one-day workshop. Pretest and post-test questionnaire were completed before and four months after education. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inference statistical methods using SPSS. 
Findings: Results showed that the midwives' knowledge, attitude and practice about pain relieving methods changed significantly following workshop (p < 0/005). No significant difference between the mean knowledge, attitude and practice scores and demographic characteristics was found.
Conclusion: Although education caused a significant effect on knowledge, attitude, and practice of midwives in using different labor pain relieving approaches as well as a positive attitude towards these approaches nevertheless the health manager's support plays an important role in regular practice of such approaches in labor wards.

Spur-dikes are river cross structures attached to river banks which cause flow deflection. Optimization modeling of spur-dikes is composed of three modules: morphological, design and optimization module. Morphological module is applied to investigate river stability.  Stable cross-section dimensions are computed by maximum sediment transport capacity of external hypothesis. Then, by applying appropriate design criteria for spur-dikes components, such as length, height, distance, number and scour hole depth, construction cost are minimized in design module. Finally, results obtained from morphological and design modules are formulated as a nonlinear multi objective optimization function by weighting method in optimization module to compute optimum dimensions of the spur-dikes. In other words, optimization module is a weighting combination of two objective functions of design and morphological module. The developed model computes variation of construction cost of super-dike with respect to sediment transport capacity of the canal, an indicative of river stability. By applying Zanjanrood river data near Sarcham Bridge, the model has been calibrated for weighting coefficient of 0.6 and 0.4 for cost and sediment transport capacity functions, respectively. Sensitivity analysis has also been carried out with respect to bed load and scour hole depth equations, which shows that they play an important role in determination of the super-dikes dimensions and construction cost. Among the bed load equations applied, Englund & Fredsoe’s have shown maximum sediment transport capacity and minimum cost while van Rijn’s, on the contrary, performed minimum sediment transport capacity and maximum cost.

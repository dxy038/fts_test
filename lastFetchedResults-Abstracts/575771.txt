One possible means of achieving better agronomic management is the use of crop models for yield prediction under different conditions. Accurate prediction of crop yield is essential for suitable water management in arid and semi arid regions. The objective of this study was developing a model for grain yield prediction of canola based on simulated leaf area index under water stress conditions. In this study, leaf area index was simulated based on cumulative temperature and water stress index. Soil water balance was also simulated based on root zone depletion, actual evapotranspiration, runoff from the soil surface and deep percolation. The model used crop and soil data and meteorological data including daily maximum and minimum air temperature (oC), precipitation (mm) and solar radiation (MJ.m-2d-1). The model was developed based on the 2004–2005 growing season data for Zarfam cultivar under full irrigation and water stress conditions, and validated with 2005–2006 growing season data. The simulation results showed that across all water levels, model performed well for grain yield simulation based on simulated LAI.

The main objective of this work consist to evaluate the long term performances of a photovoltaic systems according to the &#966;-f-chart concept in where only monthly mean values of the main weather parameters are used. The retained methodology leading evaluating the PV systems performances and that of the program developed was presented. The long term performances of a small PV system were calculated and the obtained results are compared to work presented in literature. Thus, from the obtained results it is observed that the developed program calculates the PV system performances with a good accuracy and can used as tool for a such study of any climate in where only monthly mean daily weather data are available. As application, the developed program was used to evaluate the performances of a PV system used to cover an electrical load relative to an individual house situated in Bouzare&#769;ah site, in the north of Algeria and characterized by a temperate climate. From the obtained results, it is observed that the long term performances a Photovoltaic system depend strongly from the PV number modules but the storage system size have a limited effect on PV system performances and considered only for to ensure the system autonomy. From the obtained result, it is observed that the long term hourly and daily PV system performances can be evaluated for only available monthly mean values of weather data.

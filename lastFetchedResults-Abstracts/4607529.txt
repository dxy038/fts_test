In this work, we propose a correlated equilibrium (CE)-based energy-efficient resource allocation scheme for uplink OFDMA systems. At first, we construct an energy-efficient resource allocation game, where each subcarrier is viewed as a player to choose the most satisfying user, and the objective is to balance the tradeoff between the total energy efficiency and the fairness. Since the CE can achieve better performance by helping the non-cooperative players coordinate their strategies, we employ the CE to analyze the proposed game. Next, we derive the condition under which the CE is Pareto optimal and employ linear programming duality to show its closed-form expressions. Furthermore, we present a linear programming method and a distributed algorithm based on the regret matching procedure to implement the CE, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme is able to achieve good convergence, Pareto optimality, and fairness.

Background: Catsper proteins are responsible for entering Ca2+ to the cell and play an important role in sperm motility and male fertility. Antioxidants are vital for sperm motility too. Escanbil (Calligonum) extract possess some of the important antioxidant like Catechin and Quercetin.
Objective: Here we investigated the effects of Escanbil (Calligonum) extract on the sperm parameters and the expressing of Catsper gene in aging male mice.
Materials and Methods: In this animal study, firstly, dose response was performed by using these three doses of Escanbil (Calligonum) (10, 30 and 50 mg/kg). 5 mice in each group were considered and Intra Peritoneal injection was done for 5 weeks. the sperm parameters analyzed and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL )staining was done. 30 mg/kg dose was considered as optimum dose. Secondly: fifteen aging male mice (11-13 months) were divided into three groups: control, sham and experiment. The experiments were injected Intra peritonealy with Escanbil (Calligonum) extract (30mg/kg) weekly for up to 5 weeks. The sham group was injected Intra Peritoneal (DMSO). Sperm parameters were analyzed. Expression of Catsper genes was analyzed by Real time PCR.
Results: Our results showed that after Escanbil (Calligonum) treatment (30 mg/kg), the sperm parameters were improved in experimental group (p < 0.05). Our data showed that there was a statistical significance difference between the expressions of Catsper 2, 4 in aging experiment group comparison with aging control group (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: We investigated that the Escanbil (Calligonum) extract (30 mg/kg) can improve sperm parameters and change the expression of Catsper genes in aging male mice. This herbal extract can be used as an antioxidant component for clinical usages.

The main objective of this paper is the accurate interface capturing and study on the shock-bubble interaction in gas-gas and gas-liquid two-phase flows. For this aim, the HLLC Riemann solver and Godunov numerical method were used for the first time for the 5-equation Kapila model. Transient shock wave interaction with Helium-Air and Air-Water bubbles were simulated. Numerical results were compared with available experimental results. The results have excellent agreement with experimental and previous published numerical results obtained by methods that are more sophisticated. Results show that the present method is able to capture transient shock waves and materials discontinuities and interfaces instabilities accurately and without any diffusion and oscillation.

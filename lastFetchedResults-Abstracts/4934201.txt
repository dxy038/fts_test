The objective of the subsequent study is to investigate the impact of overall interference from random scatted UWB devices to the TD-SCDMA victim system. Since the introduction of UWB devices will cause the deterioration of the wanted signals, therefore impact the TD-SCDMA system, which is a self-interfered system. Consequently the system capacity will decline. As the system capacity will vary with various random factors, the Monte Carlo method is favored and adopted in this paper to give the system capacity simulations with interference of UWB devices under FCC and ETSI simulations.

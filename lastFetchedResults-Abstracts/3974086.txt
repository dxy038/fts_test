As the single fiber bidirectional ring network develops, independently switchable bidirectional optical cross connects (IS-BOXC´s) that switch each bidirectional optical signal, both independently and simultaneously will be needed. We propose new structures of IS-BOXC´s using two different unidirectional optical cross connects. The proposed IS-BOXC´s sufficiently suppress the relative intensity noise caused by Rayleigh backscattering and optical reflection.

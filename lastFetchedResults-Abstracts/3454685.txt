This article briefly describes the evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMOO) repository, which has become much more than the simple list of bibliographic references that originated it. In its current state, the EMOO repository contains many Web resources, including Ph.D. theses, software, contact information of EMOO researchers and information about EMOO-related events. Such information has become a valuable source for students and researchers interested in this area.

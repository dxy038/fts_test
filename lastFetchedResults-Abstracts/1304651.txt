One of the current challenges in water resource management is its optimum allocation among various sectors and consumptions. The problem is becoming worse due to the population growth and increasing demand, step by step. In this study, the management of water resources in Savojbolagh was examined using Multi Objective Programming Model. According to the model, the optimum allocation rate of water was specified, and its variation percentage was compared with the existing conditions. Results showed that, the optimum pumping level increases during the hot months of the year. Furthermore, the crop cultivated area showed a noticeable decrease in a dry year in comparison to a wet year. The optimum pumping rate was also less than the current pumping rate in different months of the year. On the basis of the findings, to avoid more damage to the groundwater resources level in the region, it is necessary that both the water management resources policies and the water management of supply and demand should be reexamined and be taken into consideration again, together.

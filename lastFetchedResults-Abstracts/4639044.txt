Distributed Generation is a small source of electric power generation (typically range from less than a kW to tens of MW) that is not a part of central power system and is located close to the load. The loads of the system are uncontrolled and depend on voltage and frequency of the system. Therefore, analysis assuming constant power loads will give misleading and inaccurate results. This paper addresses the voltage sensitiveness of the loads by incorporating voltage dependent load models in the analysis. Three types of DGs are considered for implementation and DGs are modelled as PQ bus. The suitable location for placing distributed generation (DG) is identified through loss sensitivity factors and L index. Evolutionary programming is used to find the optimal size of distributed generation (DG).The objective of this paper is to minimize the total losses by optimal siting and sizing of three types of DG for a mixed realistic load model. This technique is tested on IEEE-34 bus radial distribution system and the results obtained justify the importance of optimal placement of distributed generation (DG) for minimizing losses and maximizing saving while maintaining appropriate voltage profile at all the buses.

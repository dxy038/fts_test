Due to the dynamic nature and complexity of TCP congestion control, the AQMs leave some
opportunity for improvement. The objective of this paper is to design novel AQM schemes
which achieve efficiency and robustness by using AI technologies, in particular FL. In this
paper, we elaborate on the approach of developing AQM using FL. First, we present our AQM
design and innovations in terms of the traffic load factor and the application of FL for AQM.
After describing the structure of a generic FL controller (FLC) which directs an FLC design,
the two proposed FL-based AQM (FLAQM) algorithms are then presented to realize
proactive queuing in turn. Finally we show the analysis of the efficiency and feasibility of our
proposed FLAQM algorithms.

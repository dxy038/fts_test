This paper deals with the problem concerning the framework of rotating machines diagnostics by using signal processing advanced tools and more precisely blind source separation (BSS) methods. An application on gear box is given, the objective is to separate gear mesh signals corresponding to each reducerÂ´s wheel. It enables us to diagnose and separate each defect in the event of degradation. The proposed method exploits the information redundancy around the meshing frequency and its harmonics resulting from cyclostationarity properties. This redundancy allows us to separate the contribution of each wheel from only one sensor, by tacking advantage of the non-uniformity of the mechanical structure frequency response (MSFR) connecting the exciting source to the sensor

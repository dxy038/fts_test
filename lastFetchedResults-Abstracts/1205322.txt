Nylon-66 is a typical semicrystalline polymer that can be crosslinked through electron beam (EB) irradiation. Crosslinking can dramatically change polymer properties. The objective of this research was to observe how EB irradiation affects morphology and sieving characteristics of nylon-66 membranes. EB irradiation was carried out in air at 60, 70 and 80 kGy doses. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), swelling and gel content studies evidenced the morphological changes and crosslinking of nylon-66 membranes. Sieving characteristics were also measured using pure water permeation, and rejection of raffinose, vitamin B12, and mono- and divalent salts. These results show that nylon-66 membrane surface and permeation characteristics changed with different irradiation doses. The nylon-66 surface became denser and the gel content increased with increasing irradiation dose. Furthermore, pure water permeation decreased and small molecules were increasingly rejected with greater irradiation doses. The amount of rejection was between 33% and 88.4% for vitamin B12 and between 16% and 83% for raffinose. The highest vitamin B12 and raffinose rejection was seen with a N-80 membrane, and no rejection was measured with N-0 or N-60 membranes. Salt rejection, however, was very low, especially for NaCl, with only 10.51â€“46% rejected. Based on flux, permeability and uncharged solute (vitamin B12 and raffinose) rejection data, nylon-66 type N-70 and N-80 membranes were estimated to be in the nanofiltration (NF) range.

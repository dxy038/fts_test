This paper introduces the transition process of the hydraulic turbine and the closing law of guide vanes in high, middle and low head, and establishes the multi-objective optimal model of the closing law. Based on the operating data, three parameters of the closing law are optimized in two broken line. The target value in the rated and largest head are better in new optimized closing law, even effectively coordinates the contradiction between increasing speed rise and the increasing hydrodynamic water pressure during sudden load rejection of the unit. The results can be used as the basis for operating and has an important practical significance.

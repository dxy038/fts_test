Background and objective: There are various well-known diseases resulting from adverse immune responses, therefore immunomodulators are important in order to manipulate these unwanted responses. However most of the immunomodulators makes individuals more susceptible to infectious diseases by suppressing the immune system. In this study the effect of MS 14 - a newly introduced marine-herbal preparation - on mice candidaial infection is considered.

Materials and methods: 12 female Balb/C mice at the age of 6-8 weeks were injected intravenously by 5 x 106 yeasts (Candida albicans PTCC5027) in two groups. The mice were orally administrated by MS 14 at dose of 100 mg/kg in drug group and the same volume of normal saline in control group. The mortality of mice after 24 hours was recorded. After 6 days the mice were anaesthetized, killed, peritoneal macrophages were separated and the samples of kidney and blood were cultured in Sabouraud Glucose Agar medium.

Results: MS 14 reduces the mortality of mice and the colony count of kidney culture (mean log number from 4.0 in control group to 0.8 in MS 14 group- p<0.05). The number of peritoneal macrophages was augmented about 1.7 times of control group (p<0.05).

Conclusion: MS 14 as a potentially immunomodulator which reduces some immune responses (inflammatory) has no adverse effect on Candidal infection in mice.

Suggestion: More studies on the exact protective mechanism of MS 14 in this infection model have been proposed.

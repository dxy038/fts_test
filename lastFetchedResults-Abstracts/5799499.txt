In this study, online identification of state delays is discussed. First, a novel adaptive time delay identification technique is proposed for general classes of autonomous nonlinear systems subject to state delays. As an extension, this technique is modified to design a tracking controller for general classes of nonlinear systems subject to state delays. The main novelty of this controller is that identification of unknown state delays is ensured while output tracking objective is satisfied. Extensive numerical simulations are presented that demonstrate the efficiency of the time delay identification algorithm and the tracking controller.

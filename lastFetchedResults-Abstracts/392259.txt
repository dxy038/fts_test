Objective: The aim of this study is to present our endoscopic DCR operation method without the use of silicone tubing and our results on the patients suffering from chronic epiphora with postsaccal stenosis. Methods: Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy operations were performed to 21 sides of 18 patients who had chronic epiphora. No silicone tubing was used in any of the cases. In the postoperative healing period, the rhinostomy opening was maintained with frequent removal of nasal debris and using eyedrops. The patients were evaluated by fluoresceine test and endoscopic controls. Results: Symptomatic improvement was achieved in 19 out of 21 sides of the patients (90.5%) and the results were confirmed by the fluoresceine test under endoscopic control. Conclusion: Our results of 21 sides of 18 cases underwent primary DCR without stents are as successful as those reported in the literature and the technique seems to be promising.

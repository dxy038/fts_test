Network centric unification of diverse communication and information sharing systems is a key objective for national defense. Overall, IP-convergence is the basis for seamlessly integrating the DoD SATCOM networking and information needs with the Global Information Grid (GIG). This paper explores IP networking with the emerging Regenerative Satellite Mesh-A (RSM-A) Ka band technology. The focus is on RSM-A capabilities to address key network centric requirements in providing reach back and range extension capabilities. Hughes RSM-A implementationpsilas key architectural features, with on-board packet processing and bandwidth on demand, facilitate full-mesh, multi Gbps IP packet processing SATCOM. The relevant RSM-A based capabilities and services are described with respect to a framework for evaluating satellite system architectures for meeting network centric requirements. This framework analyzes selected networking functions required by the end users and how they are supported at the various network layers in satellite communication system segments. This analysis is illustrated with conceptual design and architectural attributes, supported by representative data from test results and recent operational experience over a commercial satellite system based on RSM-A.

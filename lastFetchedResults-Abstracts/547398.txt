Background & Objective: Physical activity is important for the health of all individuals, however, the determinants of physical activity behavior for elderly remain unexplored in Iran. The purpose of this investigation was to explore a range of factors that influence participation in physical activity for a group pf elderly people in Tehran in 2008.
Methods: This was a population-based study. Structured interviews with a valid questionnaire were employed for this survey. It was carried out on four hundred members of Healthy Association in Tehran. Multistage sampling was used.
Results: The mean age of participants was 64.07 Â± 4.49. The prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle among elderly fifty-three (53%) estimated. The prevalence across the stages was as follows: 30.25% in pre contemplation, 12.75%in contemplation, 27.25% in preparation, 6.25% in action and 23.5% in maintenance. Inactive participants perceived that their laziness prevented them from being physically active. Meeting friends was the most important facilitator for participating in physical activity. The individuals who married, younger, lower body Mass index, having no chronic disease, and those with past history of exercise were more likely to adopt, initiate and maintain regular physical activity. Regression analysis showed that the greater knowledge of physical activity, higher Perceived health benefits, more Self efficacy were associated with physical activity.
Conclusion: Knowing the facilitators and barriers factors of physical activity in elderly would help to implement any future intervention for this group of people.

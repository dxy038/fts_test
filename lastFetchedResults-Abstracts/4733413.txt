The bidirectional DC-DC converter in a HEV is also some times called a power management converter, or an energy management converter, or boost DC-DC converter. This DC-DC converter is a high-power converter that links the high voltage battery (HV) at a lower voltage with the high voltage DC bus. The typical voltage of a battery pack is designed at 300 to 400V. The best operating voltage for a motor and inverter is around 600V. Therefore, this converter can be used to match the voltages of the battery system and the motor system. Other functions of this DC-DC converter include optimizing the operation of the powertrain system, reducing ripple current in the battery, and maintaining DC link voltage, hence, high power operation of the powertrain.

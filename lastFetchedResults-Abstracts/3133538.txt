In this paper, a method based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, is described to establish a correspondence between the ancient Indus script, with its descendant, a script called Brahmi that can be easily read. Our approach, which establishes a map between one or more symbols of the Indus script with each Brahmi character, is a standard problem in combinatorial optimization. As the Indus script has not yet been deciphered, this approach may have far-reaching consequences in archaeological studies.

Plug-in Hybrid Electrical Vehicle (PHEV) is attracting an increasing attention due to its benefits to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency. This paper investigates the relationship between reducing PHEV charging costs and power quality improvement. A multi-objective Particle Swarm Intelligence algorithm for optimizing the charging process is proposed, which is able to provide a balanced optimal charging solution for PHEV at minimal charging cost with acceptable power quality.

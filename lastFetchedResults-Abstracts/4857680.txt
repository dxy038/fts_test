This work investigates the effects of target signal contamination over local RX anomaly detection performance. An analytical model for signal contamination is introduced where several parameters, such as the contamination fraction and the contaminating signal strength, are employed to derive an objective measure of contamination. Results from Monte Carlo simulations show the relevance that signal contamination may have in practical applications.

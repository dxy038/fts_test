The transportation of hazardous materials such as gasoline has unique features due the
nature of these types of materials and the important role of these materials in human
life. Therefore, determining the routing of these materials is more challengeable than
non-hazardous one, due to more dangerous and risky conditions besides the
transportation costs. Since the distribution of gasoline take places in boarding (24
hours), logistics system should be able to meet these requirements in all of days. In this
paper, a new model is developed for planning the route of vehicles as 7×24 (boarding)
in order to minimize the risk of hazardous materials. The proposed vehicle routing
model in this paper has been attempted to consider minimization of transportation costs,
reduce emissions due to gasoline distribution, consumption, diminishing the route’s risk
and suggesting suitable time for servicing customers. The proposed model turns in to a
single objective model using compromise programming and then solved by
mathematical software using real data from our case study. Results are reported and
analyzed.

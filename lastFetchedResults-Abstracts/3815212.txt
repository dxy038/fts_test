The objective of this paper is to focus on manufacturability aspects of the MCM package through advanced design and modeling techniques. Two types of modeling are discussed: electrical and process. Use of electrical modeling to enhance manufacturability is demonstrated. Process modeling is driven by the requirements to maximize yield. A Poisson model which relates the product complexity and process characteristics to electrical yield are discussed. Three phases of advanced design techniques, namely cube design, substrate design and thin film design are shown to reduce cycle time and also manufacturing defects

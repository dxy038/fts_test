Different type of maintenance problems have been investigated during the past decades. With the growth in complexity of modern systems, the cost of purchasing new systems becomes higher ever than before. Surprisingly, very little attention in the literature has been paid to the failure replacement in these preventive maintenance models. However, in practice most systems incur increasingly expensive down time costs when the systems suffer the unexpected failures. The major changes to the standard maintenance model in this research are the addition of a failure replacement cost for a failed system and the reliability limit for which system has to be replaced. The overall objective of this research is to propose an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal maintenance policy. The optimal preventive maintenance policy is investigated with incorporating the costs of minimal repair, imperfect preventive maintenance, failure replacement and preventive replacement. The specific maintenance actions for a repairable system are when to perform an imperfect preventive maintenance or to replace the system while the system is in the operating condition. In another case, the specific maintenance actions for a repairable system are whether to replace the system, or to perform a minimal repair when the system fails. The number of imperfect preventive maintenance and the control limits of the optimal maintenance policy are calculated under the expected average cost rate criterion.

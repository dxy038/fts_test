Objective
m of this study is to investigate the osteogenic differentiation human dental follicle cells (hDFCs) cultured with in osteogenic induction medium (OIM) without dexamethasone (DEX), and to analyze the gene expression profile during osteogenic differentiation.
s
 which isolated from dental follicle tissue from impacted third molar teeth, were cultured with OIM with or without DEX. Osteogenic differentiation of hDFCs was examined using Alkaline phosphatase activity and Arizarin red staining. Gene expression analysis was performed by Microarray and real time-PCR.
s
wed that hDFCs have the capacity to differentiate into osteogenic lineages in osteogenic induction medium lacking DEX. We also analyzed gene expression profiling of hDFCs during osteogenic differentiation. BMP6 is up-regulated in both the presence and absence of DEX. In addition, BMP6 enhances gene expression levels of DLX-5, Runx2, and Osterix, which are transcription factors associated with osteogenic differentiation. BMP6 also stimulates phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 which are transcription factors associated with BMP signalling at protein levels. Additionally BMP6 stimulates mineralization of hDFCs monolayers examined by Arizarin red S staining.
sion
findings suggest that hDFCs can differentiate to osteogenic lineage cells osteogenic induction medium without DEX, and BMP6 is a key gene in the osteogenic differentiation of hDFCs, and has therapeutic utility for bone regeneration and bone research.

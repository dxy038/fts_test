The traditional map matching algorithms consider little about the complicated structure of the road network, and regard all roads as the same. However, in the transportation information system using the floating car data (FCD), the GPS sampling rate is low, and it is probable to figure out the incorrect result when the vehicle is in the intersection area. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a bidirectional heuristic map matching algorithm for intersections based on a data structure for intersections. This algorithm apply the data structure of intersections to separates the intersection part from common map matching, decreases the FCD map matching mistakes that caused by the complicated road network and the GPS errors, and increases the accuracy of map matching.

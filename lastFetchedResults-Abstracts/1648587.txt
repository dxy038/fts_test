In the absence of hygienic considerations, it can cause poisoning. This study aimed to determine bacterial contamination in traditional ice cream produced in Arak city in 2011. 

Material and Methods: The samples (n= 30) were randomly obtained from different parts of Arak in, 2011.  The Samples were shipped in cold conditions and total count of microorganisms test was performed according to Iranian national standards.

Results: In 16.66%, the microbial contamination was below the limit of microbial load (5Ã—104), and in 83.3% the contamination was more than allowed level.

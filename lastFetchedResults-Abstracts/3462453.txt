The problem of parameterizing the class of deadbeat controllers for a given discrete-time system through the minimum number of parameters was solved by Schlegel [1]. This note shows how to utilize the above solution to study some problems in designing deadbeat controllers. First, an algorithm is developed to compute a controller which minimizes-in an average sense-a given objective function. Second, a necessary and sufficient condition is given for the existence of an output deadbeat controller. Finally, the problem of parameterizing the set of deadbeat controllers for those systems transformable to the phase-variable block-canonical form is reconsidered.

Objective: This study was conducted to know the validity of FNAC in the diagnosis of thyroid swellings.Material and Methods: Total 300 cases were included in this study. All had FNAC examination as out patient procedure. Out of 300 cases, 285 were operated and specimen were sent for histopathology. Full clinical data of every patient was recorded.Results: In 10 patients, the swelling disappeared after FNAC and didn't recur. Cytological examination showed no evidence of malignancy. These cases were labeled as simple cysts and were not operated. Five cases showed thyroiditis and were treated conservatively and improved. Rests of the cases (285) were operated and specimens were sent for histopathology . The FNAC findings of these operated cases were benign in 250 while malignant in 35 patients. Histopathologist reported these FNAC labeled 250 benign cases as (1) Benign—248 (2) Malignant—2. Similarly histopathologist reported FNAC labeled 35 malignant cases as (1) Malignant—30 (2) Benign—5 By comparing the results of histopathology and FNAC it is evident that 5 cases were falsely diagnosed as malignant and 2 cases were falsely diagnosed as benign by FNAC.Conclusion: FNAC is safe, inexpensive and less invasive diagnostic modality with excellent patient compliance. Its routine use can make the management of thyroid swellings cost effective by avoiding unnecessary operation on conditions like simple cysts and thyroiditis. FNAC has higher accuracy (94.2% sensitivity and 94% specificity) in case of diagnosis of malignant thyroid diseases.

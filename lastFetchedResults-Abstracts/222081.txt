This paper presents a generalized Bayesian framework
for relevance feedback in content-based image retrieval. The
proposed feedback technique is based on the Bayesian learning
method and incorporates a time-varying user model into the formulation.
We define the user model with two terms: a target query
and a user conception. The target query is aimed to learn the
common features from relevant images so as to specify the userâ€™s
ideal query. The user conception is aimed to learn a parameter
set to determine the time-varying matching criterion. Therefore,
at each feedback step, the learning process updates not only the
target distribution, but also the target query and the matching
criterion. In addition, another objective of this paper is to conduct
the relevance feedback on images represented in region level. We
formulate the matching criterion using a weighting scheme and
proposed a region clustering technique to determine the region
correspondence between relevant images. With the proposed
region clustering technique, we derive a representation in region
level to characterize the target query. Experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method combined with time-varying user model
indeed achieves satisfactory results and our proposed region-based
techniques further improve the retrieval accuracy.

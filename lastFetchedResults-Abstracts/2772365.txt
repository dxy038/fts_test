This paper proposes a novel bundle delivery scheme (BDS) aimed at achieving a delay-minimal bundle delivery in the context of an intermittent roadside network. The realization of this objective is challenging whenever network information is completely unavailable. The concept of virtual space (VS) presents itself as an efficient solution that allows the source to perform necessary data bundle retransmissions to a subset of arriving vehicles. In turn, these vehicles will secure earlier delivery of the retransmitted bundles to the destination. A thorough empirical performance evaluation of the BDS shows that this scheme exhibits a delay improvement of 22.6%&#8211;40% relative to other existing schemes.

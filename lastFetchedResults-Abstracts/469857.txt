Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether multiple controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles in oocyte donors affect the ovarian response, the oocytes retrieved, or the pregnancy rates.
Study design
A retrospective chart review of repeat donor in vitro fertilization cycles between 1992 and 2003 at the University of Cincinnati Center for Reproductive Health was performed. The variables that were examined included the peak estradiol level, the length of stimulation, the number of follicles >15 mm, the amount of gonadotropins that were used, the number of oocytes that were retrieved and inseminated, the average number of cells per embryo at the time of transfer, and the clinical pregnancy rates.
Results
A total of 107 in vitro fertilized donor oocyte cycles were analyzed, of which 45 young healthy women underwent at least 2 cycles and 17 women underwent 3 cycles. Donors who underwent a second or third cycle demonstrated no differences in the cycle parameters that were observed.
Conclusion
Repeated controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles in a donor population does not demonstrate a diminished ovarian response to exogenous gonadotropins. Oocyte donors can undergo up to 3 stimulation cycles without a negative affect on the ovarian response to gonadotropins, the number of mature oocytes retrieved, the embryo quality, or the clinical pregnancy rate.

An approach to paralleling optimal power flow is described that is applicable to very large interconnected power systems and is suitable for distributed implementation. The proposed scheme is based on an augmented Lagrangian approach using the ´auxiliary problem principle´. The objective is to find a set of control parameters with which the auxiliary problem principle can be best implemented in solving distributed optimal power flow problems. The paper is a useful guide to the choice of control parameters that are highly problem dependent and sensitive to problem data. Several IEEE Reliability Test Systems and the Korea Electric Power System demonstrate alternative parameter sets that are the key elements in achieving fast convergence.

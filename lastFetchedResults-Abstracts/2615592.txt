objective of this research were to investigate of tillage on soil erosion on dry lands (3-
11% slopes) sandy loam textuer, bulkdesity 1350 kg/m3 by using Cs137 as a tracer.In
this study eight plots were chosen parallel to the slope and 8 plots were chosen
perpendicular to the slope. Cs-137 (2,7×104Bq/kg) was distributed uniformly on a 0,5
×3m to 0,2m depth in a plot.Tillage operations (moldboard plow, disk and planter) were
done on the plot in separate stage. After the tillage operations, 12 soil samples on (0,5m
distances on each plots were collected by a core sampler.The 137 Cs activity of soil samples was determined by gamma ray spectrometer and estimated soil erosion. After
primary and secondary operations, soil losses was estimating in parallel direction to the
slope(20,1, and 6,49, R2=0,93) and in perpendicular direction to the slope, (3,54 and 1,23,
R2=0,60) ton.h-1,y-1 respectively. Soil erosion in parallel direction to the slope was 5,57
times higher than in perpendicular direction to the slope.The rate soil losses was
26,59.ton. h-1.y-1 , that is very significant in long time. Thus , the best way to plow slopes
of any steepness is across the slope with furrows being turned only up ward.

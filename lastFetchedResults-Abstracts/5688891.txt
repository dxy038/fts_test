Depression is a mood disorder characterized by a sustained period of low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in activities. Dysfunction of the limbic system is implicated in depression. Different areas of this system have bidirectional links with the vestibular nucleus. The diagnosis of depression is subjective. Electrovestibulography (EVestG) might be able to assist in the diagnosis of depression in a more objective way. A dynamic measure of the excitatory (ipsilateral) responses during the background, acceleration and deceleration phases of an active tilt are compared with a small group (n=5) of depressive patients and age matched controls (n=10).

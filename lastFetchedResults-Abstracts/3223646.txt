The successful adoption of new technologies helps governments achieve efficiency in their implementation and delivery of public services to citizens. The objective behind various e-govemment initiatives has shifted in recent years towards establishing services that cater more to citizensÂ´ needs and offer greater accessibility. As a result, it is necessary to develop a well founded theoretical framework to measure the success of such initiatives. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the success factors behind governmental e-service delivery from a citizen viewpoint. This research identifies and discusses three theoretical perspectives in approaching the research problem: SI, success variables, and e-government success evaluation. A theoretical framework was developed to evaluate e-service delivery success. Initially, Additional variables were incorporated into the model from several disciplines, and re-specifications and extensions were made to develop a proposed success model for government e-services. Citizen satisfaction was proposed as a measure of e-government success, and its relationships were hypothesized with e-government system quality, information quality, e-service quality, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and citizen trust Fourteen hypotheses were formulated to test the proposed research model.

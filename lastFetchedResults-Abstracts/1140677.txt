The objective of the present work was to relate the physical evolution quantified by image analysis to the chemical transformation of beet pulp particles during enzymatic degradation. Beet pulps were degraded into a torus reactor equipped for visualisation. Pectinolytic and cellulolytic enzymes were used separately or in combination. Two global image analysis techniques were tested to characterise the size distribution of overlapping particles. Granulometric curves were extracted by mathematical morphology and a regularisation dimension was assessed by fractal analysis. Both techniques proved efficient to follow particle size evolution during degradation. When using cellulolytic enzymes alone, no chemical or physical evolution was observed. When using pectinolytic enzymes, a chemical modification occurred without any physical evolution. Particles physically disappeared when both enzymes were used. The chemical and physical evolutions of particles during degradation were interpreted taking into account the current model of molecular arrangement of primary cell walls.

The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that PBG structures can be used to conceive microwave devices. Theoretical analyses are performed applying the Finite Element Method to design volumic and planar microwave filters or active waveguides. At last, some theoretical results are compared with success to experimental ones between 10-20 GHz.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a globally significant cause of morbidity and
                            mortality in children. Few data on tuberculosis in children and
                            adolescents are available in Iran. The current study aimed to describe
                            the case characteristics and clinical-epidemiological aspects of
                            children and adolescents with TB. A retrospective review was undertaken
                            on 203 patients aged less than 19 years admitted to a referral TB
                            hospital from 2006 to 2011. Out of the 203 children and adolescents
                            diagnosed with TB, 57.6% of cases were female. Median age was 15 years
                            and 51% were 10 -18 years old; 83% had pure pulmonary TB. The common
                            type of extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) was pleuritis (64%) and 80% of the EPTB
                            cases were observed in adolescents aged 15 - 18 years. Female
                            adolescents aged 15-18 years were more likely to have positive smear
                            (88%), cultural growth (63.6%) and drug resistant TB infection (71%). In
                            this referral hospital setting, more pediatric patients with TB were
                            found among adolescent cases especially females. Early detection of
                            adolescents at risk to developing infection is the essential constituent
                            of TB control.

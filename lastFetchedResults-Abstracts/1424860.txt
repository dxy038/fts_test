Background: Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder in the elderly and several studies indicate that 10–15% of persons over 65 years suffer from significant depressive symptoms. Despite the high prevalence, most cases of depression in the elderly remain unrecognized and untreated, maybe because of a different pattern of symptoms across age groups. The objective of the study was to compare symptomatology and diagnostic profile between younger and elderly DSM-III and DSM-III-R major depressed inpatients and to advise an appropriate depression scale for the elderly. Methods: The study covers 461 depressed inpatients evaluated with the Hamilton Depression Scale and the Newcastle 1965 Scale. To find differences between younger and elderly patients, the symptomatology was analyzed stepwise by principal component analyses, latent structure analyses and single item analyses. Results: No clinically significant differences in symptomatology between younger and elderly depressed patients were found. The DSM-IV concept of Major Depression and the ICD-10 criteria for depression was not influenced by patients’ age. Limitations: All patients were hospitalized and mainly endogenously depressed and generalization of the results to other populations should be made with caution. Only pretreatment data was analyzed. Conclusions: The DSM-IV concept of Major Depression and the ICD-10 criteria for depression can be used without modification for age.

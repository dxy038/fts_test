Inroduction & Objective: Heamatological characteristics of the fish can be a marker of normal and abnormal conditions of the environment in different species of fish as animportant indicator of fish be considered. This study, was determined and studied the comparison of some biochemical factors of serum in common carp, silver carp and grass carp
Material and Methods: Tested was done with a sample of 10 fish from each group. The blood used from the tail vein was cut and was placed in a special container and was measured in laboratory value of each factor.
Results: Results showed that there is significant difference in the value of RBC, Hb, HCT, WBC, Lymphocyte and notrophil in Cyprinus carpio, Hypophthalimichthys molitrixand Ctenopharyngodon idella (p  <  0.05). But there is not any significant difference in the value of MCV, MCH, MCHC, monocyte and eosinophil (p  >  0.05). Also, results showed that there is significant difference in the value of alanin aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase  in common carp, silver carp and grass carp (p  <  0.05). But there is not any significant difference in the value of aspartate aminotransferase (p  >  0.05).  
Conclusion The results of this study show that heamatological characteristics are different for different species.

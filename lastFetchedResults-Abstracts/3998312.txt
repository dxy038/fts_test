A bidirectional transmission scheme is proposed that is suitable for an optical transmission system with Er<sup>3+</sup>-doped fibre amplifiers using pump intensity modulation of a 1.48 mu m pump laser diode. The practical feasibility of this proposal is confirmed by a system analysis and a transmission experiment. No penalty was observed for an amplified 2.4 Gbit/s signal at 1.536 mu m with a 5 MHz subcarrier from a 1.48 mu m pump laser diode.

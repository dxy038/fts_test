Wireless sensor networks are resource-constrained self-organizing systems that are
often deployed in inaccessible and inhospitable environments in order to collect data
about some outside world phenomenon. For most sensor network applications, pointto-
point reliability is not the main objective; instead, reliable event-of-interest delivery
to the server needs to be guaranteed (possibly with a certain probability). The nature
of communication in sensor networks is unpredictable and failure-prone, even more
so than in regular wireless ad hoc networks. Therefore, it is essential to provide fault
tolerant techniques for distributed sensor applications. Many recent studies in this
area take drastically different approaches to addressing the fault tolerance issue in
routing, transport and/or application layers. In this paper, we summarize and compare
existing fault tolerant techniques to support sensor applications.We also discuss several
interesting open research directions.

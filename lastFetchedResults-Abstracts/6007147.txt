A novel technique is proposed in this paper that achieves a yield optimized design from a set of optimal performance points on the Pareto front. Trade-offs among performance functions are explored through multi-objective optimization and Monte Carlo simulation is used to find the design point producing the best overall yield. One advantage of the approach presented is a reduction in the computational cost normally associated with Monte Carlo simulation. The technique offers a yield optimized robust circuit design solution with transistor level accuracy. An example using an OTA is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the work.

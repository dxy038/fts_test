Objective
cribe the isolation of Candida dubliniensis from a patient with denture stomatitis and to compare with the presence of yeasts in the oral cavities of denture wearers.

ndred and fifty-two Candida isolates were recovered through oral swabs from denture as well as the underlying mucosa from 100 patients wearing denture. For detection and identification of fungal isolates, standard phenotypic and genotypic methods were used.
s
five of 100 denture wearers suffered from denture stomatitis. Seventy-three Candida isolates were recovered from 38 denture wearers without denture stomatitis. In this group, Candida albicans was the predominant species (58.9%), followed by Candida tropicalis (15.1%), Candida guilliermondii (13.7%), Candida glabrata (9.6%), and Candida parapsilosis (2.7%).

y-nine isolates were yielded from 40 patients suffering from denture stomatitis. C. albicans was also the most frequently isolated species (58 isolates, 73.4%), followed by C. glabrata and C. tropicalis (7 isolates each, 8.9%), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2 isolates, 2.5%). One isolate was yielded of the following species: Candida famata, Candida krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. guilliermondii. Moreover 1 isolate was phenotypic and genotypic identified as C. dubliniensis genotype 1.
sions
icans is the predominant fungal species isolated from denture wearers. C. dubliniensis could be isolated from adults with denture stomatitis.

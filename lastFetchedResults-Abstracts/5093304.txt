We have recently shown that there is a previous unknown longitudinal movement present in the arterial wall. The aim is now to investigate whether the longitudinal movement is associated with longitudinal strain of the arterial wall. The objective of this paper was to describe a new non-invasive ultrasonic technique that measures the longitudinal strain of arteries in human in-vivo. Results indicate that a longitudinal strain is present in the common carotid artery.

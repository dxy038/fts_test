The objective of the present paper is the design of the effective microwave method of the complex dielectric permittivity measurement with high value real and imaginary parts of dielectric permittivity of the measured liquid in small enough volume. The central place in this task holds the research of an optimal measured resonator cell. A hemispherical dielectric filled resonator with a small central hemispherical cavity was chosen as the measured resonator cell. The central resonator cavity is surrounded by solid chemical persistent dielectric and is filled up with the measured liquid.

Dual Buck/Boost integrated three-port bidirectional DC/DC converter that this paper researches combines the conventional dual active bridge (DAB) and two bidirectional Buck/Boost circuits. The input current ripple is minimized due to interleaving operation of the two input inductors. Besides, bidirectional power flow capability between any two ports can be easily achieved with phase-shift plus PWM control. The operation principle and steady-state characteristic are analyzed, and the ZVS constraints for different operation conditions are explored in detail. Finally, both correctness of theoretical analysis and feasibility of the converter are verified with experimental results of the built 300W prototype.

A parallel program is composed of multiple processes, each of which is to perform one or more tasks defined by the program. The optimization objective for partitioning is to balance the workload among processes and to minimize the interprocess communication needs. Its primary goal is to ensure that no processor is idle while there are processes waiting for services in other processors. Mobile agent technology has the ability to travel from host to host in a network and to places of their own choosing at times. It motivates force in reducing force in reducing network traffic and overcoming network latency and their ability to operate asynchronously and independently of the process that created them, mobile agent has been an effective choice for parallel and distributed computing. In this paper, we propose a framework called MALB (mobile agent based load balancing) that uses mobile agent technology to implement efficient load balancing on computing cluster nodes. The MALB system is designed to control the all slave nodes from the master for evenly distributing workloads among processor. The key features of MALB include evaluation parallel tasks on behalf of the user. We experiment MALB with sample applications and found out. Various load balancing policies can be incorporated with versatile mobile agents in the framework. Mobile agents based load balancing approaches have the merits of high flexibility, low network traffic and high asynchrony

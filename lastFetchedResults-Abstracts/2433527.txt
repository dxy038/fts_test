The Web is one of the most important information media and it is influencing in the development of other media, as for example, newspapers, journals, books, and libraries. In this paper, we analyze the logical extensions of traditional libraries in the Information Society. In Information Society people want to communicate and collaborate. So, libraries must develop services for connecting people together in information environments. Then, the library staff need automatic techniques to facilitate so that a great number of users can access to a great number of resources. Recommender systems are tools whose objective is to evaluate and filter the great amount of information available on the Web to assist the users in their information access processes. We present a model of a fuzzy linguistic recommender system to help the University Digital Libraries users to access for their research resources. This system recommends researchers specialized and complementary resources in order to discover collaboration possibilities to form multi-disciplinar groups. In this way, this system increases social collaboration possibilities in a university framework and contributes to improve the services provided by a University Digital Library.

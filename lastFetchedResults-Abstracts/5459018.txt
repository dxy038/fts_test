Techniques of micro stereovision coupled with a stereo light microscope and two image sensors are applied to micro-manipulation, micro-assembly and micro-measurement, etc. For micro stereovision, a vision model should be given in order to calculate coordinates in the objective reference frame from image coordinates of two imaging reference frames. And stereo matching methods for stereo images are used for finding correlated features. So the relative rotation of two image sensors can bring errors when a vision model is used for calculating coordinates of the objective reference frame. In this paper, an error correction method of image sensor rotation for micro stereovision is proposed. Experiment results indicate that precision is increased about 6% after correcting the error from image sensor rotation.

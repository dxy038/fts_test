In this note, a robust control algorithm for nonlinear multi-input uncertain systems is presented. It applies to the class of systems transformable by a diffeomorphic map into the so-called parametric-pure feedback form. A tracking control objective is attained via the combination of the well-known backstepping design and the MIMO extension of a recently developed second-order sliding-mode strategy

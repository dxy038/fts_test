This article introduces a novel framework to deal with the scheduling problem concerning batch chemical plants. The main contribution of this work in comparison with previous approaches relies on the fact that it includes the environmental impact as an objective to be optimised, integrated with other more commonly used as makespan and/or financial performance. To address this problem, an advanced planning and scheduling tool (APS), which includes an environmental evaluation module based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) criteria, a temporisation algorithm and a financial module, coupled with a set of multiobjective genetic algorithms allows the computation of a set of non-dominated solutions in terms of the predefined criteria. This set of solutions can be used by the decision-maker in order to select the one that represents the right compromise among the different objectives.

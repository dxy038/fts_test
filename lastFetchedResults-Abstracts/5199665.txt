So far, we have developed effective wide area disaster information network (WDN) using Internet over the combination of both wired and wireless network. In this information network, two important functions including resident safety information system and bidirectional video communication system between evacuation places and disaster information center are provided. However, in this WDN, system failure of network and computing facilities by disaster was not considered. In order to recover the information system as soon as possible from the system failure, network protocol has to deal with those requirements. In this paper, we introduce wireless recovery protocol (WRP) to temporally recover WDN with minimum configuration even though some of network and computing facilities were damaged by disaster, using network management and GPS functions. The design and implementation of the WRP is precisely described. The prototype system and its hardware and software environment to evaluate its functionality are also precisely described.

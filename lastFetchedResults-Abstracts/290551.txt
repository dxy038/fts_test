The trainee gynaecologist requires specific teaching to achieve competency in gynaecological surgery. Basic skills such as knot tying and suturing should be acquired outside the operating theatre. They can be learned on simulations, including bench models, using synthetic materials, life-like models and animal tissue. Video training equipment is useful for the development of basic laparoscopic handâ€“eye coordination. Intermediate and advanced skills require simulations using more sophisticated bench models, live animals and virtual reality computerised systems. Structured teaching and assessment methods are essential. Surgical skills training models should be reliable and valid, and can be incorporated into an objective structured clinical examination, which could be used to assess individual development and allow progression through a training programme. Simulation training does translate into improved operative performance. Supervised operating experience on patients is crucial to training and should be assessed regularly using a global rating form with constructive feedback to facilitate improvement.

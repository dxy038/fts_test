In the steelmaking and continuous casting (SMCC) production process, operation time delay may lead to casting break or processing conflict so that the initial scheduling plan becomes unrealizable. Existing research methods are difficult to guarantee the accuracy of the model and successful application to actual applications. The rescheduling problem in response to operation time delay is firstly analyzed. This is then followed by the establishment of a novel multi-objective nonlinear programming model (MONPM). In specifications, a three-stage rescheduling method is proposed including the batches splitting (BS), forward scheduling method (FSM) and backward scheduling method (BSM). As a result, the real-time application shows that the proposed rescheduling method efficiently ensures the continuous casting and dramatically shortens the redundant waiting time for molten steel in very short rescheduling time.

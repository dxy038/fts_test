Background: Bacterial sepsis in neonates is a clinical syndrome characterized by systemic signs of infection and accompanied by bacteremia in the first month of life. The mortality rate is high and sometimes has reported up to 50%.
Objective: Isolation of aerobic bacteria which are responsible for neonatal sepsis and determination of their antibiotic sensitivity patterns.
Methods: The study was cross-sectional and undertaken in Imam Khomaini Hospital, Ahwaz during year 2000. Blood culture, identification of isolated species and susceptibility testing were done according to the standard techniques used in microbiology laboratories. Findings: The results showed that ten cases had positive blood culture which all of the isolated bacteria were gram negative bacilli. Enterobacter species were the predominant pathogens (50%). KIebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coil had similar frequencies (20%). One case was recognized as Alcaligens xylooxidans (10%). All of the isolated bacteria were nearly susceptible to amikacin and resistant to ampicillin.
Conclusion: Based on the overall results of the study, entric gram negative bacteria were the common cause of neonatal sepsis.

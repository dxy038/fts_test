Building fire risk evaluation is the base of building fire risk management. Carrying out building fire risk evaluation can effectively prevent and control the building fire accident occurring. In this study, a fuzzy approach to building fire risk assessment methodology using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) and synthetic weights provided to assist decision-makers in determining the proper weights of building fire risk factors. Firstly, the factors influencing building fire risk were discussed based on fault analysis tree (FAT) and indices of evaluating building fire risk were established. Then, the building fire risk is evaluated using fuzzy mathematics tool and the method determining the synthetic weights of indexes including both subjective favoritism and objective information qualitative knowledge and quantitative data to be integrated were given. Finally, an application case for this method to fire risk assessment was provided.

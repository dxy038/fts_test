Electric vehicles provide portable energy storage that can be used in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) applications. In order to source power to the grid, the power electronics on-board these vehicles must be bidirectional. A single stage bidirectional isolated AC-DC converter is discussed. A modulation scheme for this topology is proposed to provide control of real and reactive power. A control scheme is coupled with the modulation and allows the topology to act as an inductive or capacitive or load while sinking or supplying power. The proposed modulation scheme can charge the electric vehicle battery as well as provide ancillary services to the grid. The modulation and control scheme are analyzed and discussed. Simulation and hardware results are presented.

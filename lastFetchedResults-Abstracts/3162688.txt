A novel structure of Reconfigurable Orthogonal Antenna Array (ROAA) was constructed as a box structure which includes four verticals of the Reconfigurable Planar Antenna Array (RPAA) at 5.8GHz is presented. The main objective of this work is to design and analyze the ROAA with its active feeding network (based on PIN diode switches) to steer beam over 360&#176;. The integration of PIN diode switches with antenna enables to steer the antenna beams to the desired direction. This can be done by changing the switch state to either on or off mode for each RPAA. The switches are used to select the port at feed network and supply the RF signal to the antenna for changing the apertureÂ´s function during operation. The 16-PIC power controller output is used to control and supply the DC voltage to activate the RF switches mode. The experimental results of the ROAA are represented. These results clearly show that the main beam for the antenna can be steered by changing the switch configuration.

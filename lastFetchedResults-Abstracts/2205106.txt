The main objective of this work is to study the delayed cracking phenomenon of the 301LN unstable austenitic steel, by determining the distribution of residual stresses after deep drawing, taking into account the phase transformation. Deep drawing for different ratios is done for two different temperatures. Cracks appear for the highest drawing ratio (DR = 2.00) in the top of the cup. The breaking patterns observed using a scanning electron microscope show ductile fracture in the middle region, and both intergranular and transgranular rupture in the edges. Martensite contents throughout the cup wall and through the thickness are determined. Increasing the martensite content was found to have a great effect on the cracking sensitivity. X-ray diffraction allows us to determine the residual stresses in the martensitic phase. These last are positive, increase with increasing drawing ratios. The maximum value is located at the middle height of the cup, it exceeds 500 MPa for the 2.00 drawing ratio, and is less than 350 MPa for the 1.89 drawing ratio.

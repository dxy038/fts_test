Background and Objective: Several positive properties of electronic teaching in teaching _learning situations have been caused its widespread prevalence in various fields. Among the target groups, nurses are the best choice for e-teaching because of their excessive working hours. So, the purpose of this study is to determine the effect of electronic teaching of air medical transport on nurses learning.
Materials and Method: In this semi-experimental study 30 employed nurses in Baqiyatallah hospital of Tehran were selected by simple random sampling in 2011. The electronic teaching of air medical transport was done. The questionnaire was designed by researcher which consisted of 30 questions. This instrument assessed the effect of teaching in three levels of cognitive domain consisting of knowledge, comprehension and application before, immediately after teaching and 2 weeks later. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16, repeated measures ANOVA and independent T-Tests.
 Results: The mean and standard deviation of knowledge scores, before, after teaching and 2 weeks later, were respectively 5/3±1/8, 7/5±1/92, 7/7±1/55, in comprehension level 4/76±1/61, 6/06±1/43, 6/33±1/47 and in application level 4/5±1/57, 7/56±2/04, 7/3±1/7. From 30 total scores, the scores of three levels were 14/3±3/71 before, 21/13±4/41 immediately after and 21/33±3/17 two weeks later. There was a significant difference in all levels of learning (P=0/003).
Conclusion: Results showed that application of virtual methods can be improve the learning of theoretical courses and active participation of nurses, thus it is recommended that multi-media methods are used in order to time saving and more effectiveness in nursing  service training.

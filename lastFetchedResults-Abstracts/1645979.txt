B-Glucosidase is involved in the degradation of cellulose in soil and has the potential for monitoring biological soil quality. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of barley residue placement, burning, nitrogen fertilizer and tillage management on B-glucosidase enzyme after a period of 90 days. A field experiment was carried out based on a completely randomized design with a factorial arrangement using two replications. The treatments were included two levels of barley residue (3 and 6 t.ha-1), burning (without and with stubble burning), urea fertilizer (0 and 125 kg.ha-1) and tillage systems (no-till, conventional tillage). Results showed that 6 t.ha-1 crop residue treatment increased B-glucosidase activity in comparison with 3 t.ha-1 treatment at 0-5 cm. However, stubble burning and tillage treatments significantly decreased B-glucosidase activity while the nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased B-glucosidase activity. The results of this experiment showed that no-tillage system along with crop residue retention of 6 t. ha-1 and without stubble burning systems could be the most short-term effective management to protect and promote B-glucosidase activity.

Objectives
To identify an accurate and reproducible method to define myocardial infarct (MI) size, we conducted a study in a closed-chest canine model of acute myocardial infarction, in which MI size was measured using different thresholding techniques and by imaging at different delay times after contrast administration.
Background

The MI size by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) is directly related to long-term prognosis. However, previous measurements were done using nonuniform methods and tended to overestimate nonviable areas.
Methods

Thirteen animals underwent 90 min of coronary artery occlusion, followed by reperfusion. The CE-MRI data were acquired within 24 h after reperfusion and compared with triphenyltetrazolium chloride pathology. In the first nine animals, images were obtained not, vert, similar15 min after gadolinium diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) using an inversion-recovery gradient-echo pulse sequence. To identify the most accurate method, MI size by CE-MRI was measured visually and by semi-automatic thresholding techniques, using different criteria. In four additional animals, images were acquired every 6 min until 30 min after Gd-DTPA.
Results

Postmortem MI size was 13.5 ± 2.6% of left ventricular volume. Semi-automatic techniques, using full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) criterion, correlated best with postmortem data (r2 = 0.94, p < 0.001; results confirmed by Bland-Altman plots). Using FWHM, there was no difference in MI size between different delay times after contrast (15.2 ± 2.9% to 14.5 ± 4.2% at 6 and 30 min, respectively; p = NS).
Conclusions

When an objective technique is used to define MI size by CE-MRI, accurate infarct size measurements can be obtained from images obtained up to 30 min after contrast administration.

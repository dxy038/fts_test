Background and Objective: Cardiovascular diseases are one of the causes of death in obese women. This study was conducted to examine the effects of diet, exercise, and both on serum lipids and lipoproteins in obese females.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 45 sedentary and healthy obese females (29.01±2.55 y, body mass index 33.11±1.66 kg.m-2) were randomly divided into four groups: diet alone (500 kcal less than daily energy expenditure, n=10), exercise alone (six 60 minute per week 60% - 80% maximum heart rate, n=11), exercise and diet (250 kcal less than daily energy expenditure, four 60 minute per week 60% - 80% maximum heart rate, n=12), and control (n=12). Body composition, serum lipids, and lipoproteins were measured in all subjects at baseline and after an 8-week intervention period. The data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics, which was accomplished by one-way ANOVA followed by the LSD post-hoc test (p < 0.05).

Results: Subjects in the diet and exercise group lost 5.47±0.6 kg and those in the diet group lost 5.54±0.7 kg of their body mass. No significant changes were observed in the exercise group relative to the control group. After 8 weeks of intervention, serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol decreased in both diet and exercise and diet groups and it was most strongly related to weight loss.

Conclusion: Diet and exercise are the most effective means of reducing lipid and lipoprotein risk factors in obese women.

A 3-D surface seismic reflection survey, covering an area of over 7.7 km2, was conducted at
the Rye Patch geothermal reservoir (Nevada, USA) to explore the structural features that
may control geothermal production in the area. In addition to the surface sources and receivers,
a high-temperature three-component seismometer was deployed in a borehole at a depth
of 1250 m within the basement below the reservoir, which recorded the waves generated by all
surface sources. The objective of this study was to determine the subsurface structure of the
reservoir based on this surface-to-borehole dataset. A total of 1959 first-arrival travel times
were determined out of 2134 possible traces. Two-dimensional ray tracing was performed to
simulate wave propagation from the surface sources to the receiver at depth. The ray tracing
was based on a 2-D laterally homogeneous velocity model derived from results of a verticalseismic-
profile (VSP) experiment recorded in the same well. The method is an approximation
where it is assumed that differences in travel time between the observed and modeled data are
caused by structural deviations from a homogeneously layered model as estimated by the VSP
profile, and thus are mapped into topographic changes at depth. The results indicate, to first
order, the presence of two dominant geologic features. The first observation is consistent with
the regional trend of the geologic units in the Basin and Range province with a north-south
strike and dip to the west, as expected for this area west of the Humboldt Thrust Range. The
second is a local feature in the form of an eastâ€“west ridge. The geometry of the structure is
corroborated by results from a seismic-reflection survey, and by results of a gravity survey
conducted in the area above the reservoir.

For manufacturers of machine tools a core challenge is to offer complete, client-specific production systems as a system supplier. Consequently, the requirements for automation and handling technology are constantly increasing. In particular, the type of linkage between machine tools and peripheral devices is very important. Usually several suppliers are involved in the development of an agile manufacturing system (AMS), due to the numerous components of handling systems. In most cases, there is no transparency about the process chain, the capabilities and necessities of handling and automation functions on all supplier levels. Furthermore, every supplier optimizes its own part of the system in terms of cost, cycle time and availability. The wbk Institute of Production Science developed a new simulation-based configuration tool for an optimal sharing of automation and handling functions among the suppliers of AMS. The focus of the approach lies on the automation and handling functions, such as transport, clamping, gripping, and the layout of machining cells, but not on the optimization of machine tools themselves. The objective of this paper is to achieve an overall optimum regarding output, utilization of machining cells and availability of an integrated automation process chain.

A new method to find the minimum circular envelope of a radiating system from one view, one frequency field data is presented. Without solving the full inverse problem, the approach estimates the center and the radius of the smallest ball containing the sources/scatterers by minimizing a monomodal objective functional by means of a gradient-based optimization technique. The results of the numerical analysis asses the reliability of the proposed technique

Objective
The aim of this study was to determine whether Microdispersed Oxidized Cellulose (MDOC) possesses a hypolipidemic effect in apolipoprotein-E/low-density lipoprotein receptor double-knockout (ApoE/LDLR-deficient) mice and the possible mechanism of this effect in mice.
Methods
Female ApoE/LDLR-deficient mice subdivided into two groups were fed with a Western-type diet for 8 wk, and the experimental group was supplemented with 5% MDOC for 8 wk. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed an atherogenic diet containing 5% MDOC or pectin for the determination of a possible hypolipidemic mechanism of MDOC action.
Results
Biochemical analysis showed that 5% MDOC treatment significantly decreased total cholesterol by 20% (P = 0.0338) and very-LDL cholesterol by 21% (P = 0.0110) and significantly increased the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 62% (P = 0.0172) when compared with non-treated ApoE/LDLR-deficient mice. The results Association of Official Analytical Chemists method 991.43 revealed that MDOC contains 59.78 Â± 5.0% of fiber. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that administration of MDOC did not affect cholesterol absorption in the small intestine. Using C57BL/6J mice, MDOC and pectin treatments decreased cholesterol content in liver and increased fermentation in the gut in vivo. In vitro experiments confirmed that MDOC is fermentable under conditions mimicking those in the large intestine.
Conclusion
We demonstrated hypolipidemic effects of MDOC in ApoE/LDLR-deficient mice. Moreover, we propose that MDOC is a hypolipidemic soluble fiber acting probably by increased fermentation and production of short-chain fatty acids in the large intestine in mice. We propose that MDOC might be a possible source of soluble fiber for use in dietary supplements.

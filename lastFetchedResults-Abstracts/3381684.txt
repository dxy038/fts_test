The objective of this study is to model the association between the electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral features and the novel r scale representing the sedative effects of the propofol anesthetic drug. On the basis of the r scale, the unresponsiveness to the verbal command (LVC) is forecasted. EEG recordings are taken from a 16-patient study population undergoing propofol anesthetic induction. EEG was filtered into consecutive 4-Hz passbands up to 28 Hz. Of these time-series, the amplitude envelopes were extracted and used as input features to the first and the second-order polynomial multiple linear regression models. The values risin[0.4,1] were predicted with the R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.775 with a cross validation. The LVC times were forecasted with the median error of 5%-7% or equivalently 10-13 s. In contrast, using the median of the measured LVC times of the training population as a forecast, the corresponding error was 12% or 26 s. The results suggest an acceptable correlation between the r scale and the EEG spectrum in the studied range. Moreover, the r values of an individual can be predicted using a population model. The suggested framework enables forecasting the LVC, which may open new possibilities for steering the drug administration

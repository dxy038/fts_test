In this work we design, simulate and implement two fuzzy-logic based algorithms for mobile robots: one for obstacle avoidance, and another one with the combined objective of avoiding obstacles and as well as reaching a pre-defined target point in an unknown environment. The hardware used in this project is the National Instruments (NI)Â´s embedded robotic platform which houses the SBRIO (Single-board Reconfigurable Input-Output) that includes a powerful real-time controller, and a field programmable gate array (FPGA). For obstacle avoidance the robot has only one rotating ultrasonic sensor on the front side. The software is implemented using high-level Lab VIEW modules for embedded FPGA and real-time programming. Results show the key advantages of this new approach which is its accuracy, simplicity and quicker reaction to sudden changes especially when the robot is moving in an unstructured environment. This is due to the fact that the approach accounts for the size and shape of the robot and generates the speed of motion proportional to the distance from the obstacle.

The paper presents a unified methodology for an efficient Digital Signal Processor (DSP) implementation of acoustic echo cancellation algorithm based on the Fast Exact Least Mean Square (FELMS) adaptive algorithms. The difficulty is to retain as much as possible the improvement brought by the reduction of the arithmetic complexity of FELMS adaptive algorithms without exceeding DSP resources such as pointer register. The objective is reached by an efficient data management and an optimal memory data organization

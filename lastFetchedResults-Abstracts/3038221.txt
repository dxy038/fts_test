IP over WDM networks are a promising candidate for the next generation optical Internet networks. A new traffic-engineering (TE) scheme is proposed in this paper with the objective to route subwavelength connection requests with QoS constraints. In particular, we consider the routing of high-priority connections characterized by stringent requirements in term of delay and packet-loss ratio, by translating them into constraints at the physical layer. Furthermore, in order to provide efficient service differentiation, the impact of a suboptimal preemption algorithm is analyzed through extensive simulation experiments considering both the blocking probability and the network disruption, while comparing it with an optimal mechanism proposed in literature.

That Human vision apperceives the objective world is always represents as an image. The most basic characteristics of an image are the space distributions, L(i,x,y), of gray/chroma. The physical parameters of the objective world apperceived by human vision just are the physical parameters of an image. These physical parameters are the important elements constructing an image and influencing the visual quality of an image. Therefor, these physically measurable parameters are called the visual parameters of an image. The definitions, measurement methods and the associations with image quality of these visual parameters would be described in this paper.

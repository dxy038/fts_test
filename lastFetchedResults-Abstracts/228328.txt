A considerable amount of attention has been paid
lately to a number of data hiding methods based in quantization,
seeking to achieve in practice the results predicted by Costa
for a channel with side information at the encoder. With the
objective of filling a gap in the literature, this paper supplies a
fair comparison between significant representatives of both this
family of methods and the former spread-spectrum approaches
that make use of near-optimal ML decoding; the comparison is
based on measuring their probabilities of decoding error in the
presence of channel distortions. Accurate analytical expressions
and tight bounds for the probability of decoding error are given
and validated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. For dithered
modulation (DM), a novel technique that allows us to obtain
tighter bounds to the probability of error is presented. Within
the new framework, the strong points and weaknesses of both
methods are distinctly displayed. This comparative study allows
us to propose a new technique named “quantized projection”
(QP), which, by adequately combining elements of those previous
approaches, produces gains in performance.

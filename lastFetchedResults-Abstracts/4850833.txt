This study presents an integrated computer simulation and genetic algorithm for optimizing operator allocation in some workstations to maximize production throughput in a large multi product assembly shop. At first, computer simulation is used as an exquisite tool for modeling and analyzing the true performance of the system. Then, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to maximize throughput of the system. In the other words, optimal number of sub-station operators is found using GA such that the throughput is maximized. The results show that for having the maximum throughput we must allocate 4, 2, 3 and 3 operators to stations 11, 12, 13 and 15, respectively. We achieve the result with less frequency by integrating GA and computer simulation. The results of this study shows that the integrated GA simulation is ideal to be applied for problems with several numbers of parameters and variables and complex objective function.

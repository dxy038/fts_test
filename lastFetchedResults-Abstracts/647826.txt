The objective of this study was to determine the impact by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in areas in which samples are regularly taken by the German Environmental Specimen Bank (GESB). A filter combination consisting of a glass fibre and a PU foam filter has been used to completely collect atmospheric pollutants allowing a quantitative extraction of the PAHs collected and a simple cleanup. The mass spectrometric evaluation using deuterated standards resulted in standard deviations of 1–6% for various PAHs detected by this method (extraction + cleanup + MS-SIM) applied to the sub-nanogram range. The repeatability of the method (sampling + analysis) has been checked by taking 5 different samples with 5 different samplers at the same location. The sampling period was 6 h and resulted in variation coefficients of 2.1–10.2%.
Real samples were taken in 3 different areas more than 400 km distant from each other (Halle/Leipzig, N=7; Saarland, N=14, Großhansdorf, N=30).
Almost identical profiles of the volatile PAHs were recorded in all 3 areas suggesting a long-distance intermix of the atmosphere. However, different profiles of particle-bound PAHs were found in different sampling areas indicating that they are suitable to characterise local emission rates and possibly also emission sources.

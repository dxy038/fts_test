The concept of inductively shielded superconductive magnetic energy storage is extended from toroidal to solenoidal magnets. A framework for such a system, an analytic method, and a design principle, are also introduced. An appropriate objective function was found for identifying the variation of the inner and outer compensated solenoid coils with respect to position. This function was optimized using the conjugate gradient method. Using the results of the analysis, an experimental magnetic system was built and tested. The results indicated good agreement with calculations; the leakage field was less than 0.6% of the central field.

Summary form only give, as follows. The data processing aspects of ultrasonic NDT are reviewed mainly with respect to work carried out recently at Harwell. The objective is to show how increasingly sophisticated methods of data processing, such as SAFT, image sharpening, pattern recognition, etc., are beginning to be applied. They can lead to more objective decision on behalf of the inspector and greater reliability. These methods however required extensive data and this leads to potential problems in data storage and computer speed. The extend of this problem is illustrated with simple examples. Computer performance will continue to increase so that brute force solutions to this problem are probable eventually. However it is worth looking at ways to avoid having to use ever larger computer power

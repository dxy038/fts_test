Introduction & Objective: Venous thromboembolic disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are a spectrum of a single disease entity.  In most clinical situations, anticoagulation is the preferred form of therapy .IVC filter  placement when using anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated or proves ineffective. The placement of an IVC filter is considered standard preventive treatment for PE. The aim of this study was follow up of patients with permanent vena cava filters in the prevention of pulmonary embolism after six months. 
Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study 6 patients with IVC filter were followed up after 6 months. They were examined about having emboli, reccurent DVT, edema, varicosis, bleeding, misplacement, and fracture of filter. Data were analyzed with SPSSV17. 
Results: 6 patients having a mean age of 58.6 years were evaluated.  There was no difference in sex . The reason of admission in all cases was DVT. Doppler sonography was done for all the patients. In 66.66% anticoagulation therapy was done before surgery. The filter was placed percutaneously in all cases. After 6 months in 5 cases there were no signs of DVT, PE, edema, and varicosis. In addition one patient died because of respiratory arrest due to encephalopathy. No complications were seen during admission period. 
Conclusion: Although IVC filter increases the risk of recurrent DVT in the long term ,it remarkablely decreases the risk of PE.IVC filter is a useful and effective treatment in patients with contraindication of using anticoagulation therapy especially in patients with cancer.

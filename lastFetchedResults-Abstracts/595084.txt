Objective: To assess the durability of Devega's repair of tricuspid valve in severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR).Material and Methods: From January 2002 to December 2003. 22 Devega's surgical repairs of tricuspid valve in severe TR were done either with mitral valve replacement or with Atrial Septal Defect (Secundum Type) repair. Clinical data was retrieved from hospital records and analyzed post-operatively on the basis of NYHA status and echocardiography findings at the interval of 6, 12 and 24 weeks. The durability of Devega's repair was assessed.Results: Out of 22 Devega's repair, over 80% of the patients having severe TR+3 reverted to no TR and about 20% patients had mild TR postoperatively at the interval of 6 months and the repair was intact on echocardiography.Conclusion: Devega's repair of tricuspid valve in severe TR is a safe and economical procedure in our setup.

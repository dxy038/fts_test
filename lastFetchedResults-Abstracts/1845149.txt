Zero (ZQ) and double (DQ) quantum 2D chemical shift selective and spin-echo 3D NMR imaging at microscopy resolution, has been applied to the morphological study of silkworm, Bombyx mori, during its metamorphosis. Attention has been focused on the evolution of the internal structure of the insect during its postembryonal life occurring through the larval, pupal and adult development. A major objective of this work was the characterization of the silk glands, responsible for synthesis and secretion of fibroin and sericin, through the changes of distribution and mobility of water, by imaging the water protons during postembryonal life stages. Moreover, alanine deriving from silk gland proteins was imaged during the last life stage of Bombyx mori.

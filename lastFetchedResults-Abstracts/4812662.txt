A throwing motion control for a 2 degree of freedom robot is studied. Our control objective is to reduce the target error. We design a trajectory of the robot in consideration of the torque limit, the maximum angular velocity and the time required, from the beginning of the throwing motion to hitting a mark. We apply nonlinear dynamic compensation with parameter estimation for trajectory control. Furthermore, we modify the time when an object is released from hand by using the estimated parameters and the predicted target error. The effectiveness of this method is examined. The result shows that this method provides satisfactory performance for a reduction of target error

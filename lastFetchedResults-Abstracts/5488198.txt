The ability to visualize time-varying phenomena is paramount to ensure correct interpretation and analysis, provoke insights, and communicate those insights to others. In particular, interactive visualization allows us the freedom to explore the spatial and temporal domains of such phenomena. The task of visualizing tissue growth is challenging because of two factors: The amount of data that needs to be visualized and the large simulation parameter space. In this paper, we present our application of visualization to a three-dimensional simulation model for tissue growth. Cellular automata is used to model populations of cells that execute persistent random walks on the computational grid, collide, and proliferate until they reach confluence. Our research objective is the progress toward the development of a problem-solving environment that can guide the design of experiments for tissue engineers.

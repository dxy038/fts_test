"Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP)" provides a discipline-neutral means of requesting and providing data across the World Wide Web. The paper elaborates on the design and building of the OPeNDAP-based Physical Oceanographic Data Service System of South China Sea, which uses the GDS, TDS and Dapper data servers to implement the OPeNDAP Services of wind, current, wave, tide, Argo float, CTD and ADCP data, and uses LAS and DChart to provide interactive interface. The goal is to allow all end users to access transparently whatever data they require in a form they can use, all while using their favorite application. With the help of OPeNDAP, it achieves the objective of seamless access to physical oceanographic data of South China Sea in a highly heterogeneously distributed environment over the network.

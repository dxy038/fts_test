Polymeric insulators used in 13.8 kV distribution network are presenting premature damage due to cavity inner dielectric. With the objective to develop a diagnostic process, it was constructed an experimental distribution line in Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE) campus. In this article it will be described this experimental line characteristics and performed studies to plan its construction.

SINCE REDUCTION of maintenance was the primary objective for the development of a new watt-hour meter, detailed consideration was given during its design to the resistance-to-surge problem. By reducing the hazards of meter damage from surges, longer service periods without attention are possible. This provides savings which are particularly important to operating utilities under present conditions of increasing labor costs for maintenance and testing of meters.

Smart grid enables Distributed Energy Resources (DERs); wind, energy storage and demand response through advanced technologies. Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is great example of the technologies which allows coupling of independent energy networks together. Energy Hub (EH) has been originated as a new approach to optimal planning and operation of combined networks in recent years. Wind turbine as an important of distributed generation in the world as beenh integrated to electricity network over two past decades. Optimal placement of wind turbine in multi carrier energy network in presence of CHP as another distributed produce source originates novel challenge which is considered in this paper. A multi objective function is formulated to solve the optimization problem with considering multi carrier energy network operation costs, loss and voltage profile. Simulation carries out a 33 bus radial distribution network which is supplied with CHP in some buses. CPLEX solver of GAMS and Genetic Algorithm of MATLAB is employed to solve the problem. Simulation results reveal optimal allocation of wind turbine in multi carrier energy networks in presence of CHP. Results demonstrate that optimal placement of wind turbine in the systems improves operation costs till 8% and loss power till 5%. It also enhances voltage profile till 0.5%.

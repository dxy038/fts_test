In this paper, a wavelet based image super-resolution reconstruction algorithm is presented. The super-resolution image reconstruction problem is known to be an ill-posed inverse problem. The objective of the suggested algorithm is to remove this ill posedness. The suggested algorithm is based on breaking the problem into four consecutive steps, a registration step, a multi-channel maximum entropy restoration step, a wavelet based image fusion step and finally a maximum entropy image interpolation step. The objective of the wavelet fusion step is to integrate the data obtained from each output from the multi-channel restoration step into a single image, which is then interpolated using the maximum entropy interpolation scheme. The paper explains the implementation of each step of the suggested algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm has succeeded to obtain a high-resolution (HR) image from multiple degraded observations with a high PSNR. The computation time of the proposed algorithm is small

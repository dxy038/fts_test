Although political development, which means promoting participation of all people in determining the fate of political entities, can be achieved through a variety of methods, it is the common goal of all developmental viewpoints. Elections as the most prominent method and manifestation of that participation have been of great importance to theorists of social and political science and also to politicians. An important question for both groups has been to explain the election behavior of people and various social groups. Study of election behavior has been also a serious concern for researchers in relevant fields in the Islamic Republic of Iran, especially during the past decade. The main question of this paper is what norms and criteria shape election behavior of university students which is among main indices of political development, and what role is played by social networks in setting and directing those norms? The goal of this paper is to study the relationship between social networks and election behavior of students at Isfahan University. By dividing social networks into three categories of vertical, horizontal, and qualities of social networks, and also by focusing on four dimensions of political participation, namely, subjective, official, unofficial, and objective dimensions, it has become clear that horizontal networks have had the highest impact on the political participation of students with the lowest effect proven for the qualities of social networks.

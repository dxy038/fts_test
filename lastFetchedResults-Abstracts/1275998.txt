Sediments represent a vast sink for contaminants in aquatic systems, and may pose a threat to pelagic and benthic organisms. The objective of this research was to determine the bioavailability and toxicity of sediment-associated PAHs and heavy metals, using embryos and larvae of the oyster Crassostrea gigas, exposed to two sediment fractions: the whole sediment and the elutriate. The percentages of abnormal larvae, the contaminant accumulation and, (in the case of metal contamination), the induction of metallothionein in the larvae, were investigated. Sediment-associated PAHs and heavy metals were available for exposure, as indicated by their accumulation in C. gigas larvae and by the abnormalities induced during larval development. The critical body burden of PAHs (Fluo, Pyr, BaA, Triph, Chrys, BbF, BkF, BjK, BeP, BaP, Per, IP, BPer and the DahA) in the larvae was 0.3 μg g−1, above which abnormalities were observed. This value corresponds to concentrations observed for most vertebrate and invertebrate species. The bioavailability of PAHs is determined by their solubility; only the soluble fraction of PAHs is accumulated by the embryos. The bioavailability of metals for the larvae is substantiated by MT induction, correlated with cytosolic metal concentrations. MT induction provided a better early-warning response than the embryotoxicity test currently used for evaluating environmental contamination by metals. This study recommends choosing oyster embryos as a particularly sensitive tool for evaluating sediment quality

In this work, we are interested in detecting blotches in degraded old films. The objective of this paper is to study the impact of the motion estimation technique on our wavelet-based blotch detector and we propose a robust multiresolution motion estimation approach based on the block-matching algorithm. The experimental results indicate that this robust algorithm significantly improves the detector performances and reduces its computational complexity.

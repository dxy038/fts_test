Introduction & Objective: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic progressive inflammatory
disease of the articular joint that results in significant pain, stiffness and swelling and leads to
destruction. The clinical findings and biomarkers application can allow clinicians to quality
the effects of aggressive treatment during the first stage of the disease in order to prevent joint
destruction and disability. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between
joint erosion and clinical and laboratory findings.
Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study 266 patients with RA referred to Mobasher
Kashani hospital in Hamadan were evaluated. The data of clinical and laboratory findings and
X ray results were collected and analyzed by chi square test.
Results: The study showed that the painful joint, number of painful joint and swelling joint had
a significant correlation with erosion (P=O.05, P=O.057, P=O.013 respectively). The morning
stiffness, fatigue and rheumatoid nodule had a significant correlation with joint erosion
(P=O.OOI , P=O.OO , P=O.04 respectively). However the number of joint swelling, elevated
ESR, positive CRP and positive RF didn't have significant correlation with joint erosion
(P=O.18, P=O.I08, P=O.66, P=O.32 respectively).
Conclusions: We conclude that for a better diagnosis of joint erosion both clinical and
paraclinical findings should be considered.

Progesterone is essential for maintaining pregnancy in goats, and embryonic losses may
be a consequence of the reduction in circulating progesterone levels close to the time of
implantation. Some evidence exists regarding social dominance affecting the plasma progesterone
levels in several species—where dominant females conceive earlier. The objective
of this research was to determine whether serum progesterone levels differ in goats of different
social status. A behavioural study was conducted for 10 days in a herd of 57 does and
an individual success index (SI) was calculated according to the result of aggressive interactions.
Goats were classified as high (SI: 1–0.67), medium (SI: 0.66–0.34) and low-ranking
(SI: 0.33–0.0). Ovulation was synchronized using two injections of prostaglandin 11 days
apart, and the plasma progesterone levels determined daily for a period of 20 days. The area
under the plasma progesterone curve during the entire study was greater in the high than in
the medium and low-ranking does (96.2±5.8, 79.5±5.3 and 81.3±5.3 ng/ml, respectively,
P < 0.05). During days 11–17 following prostaglandin synchronization, the plasma progesterone
levels were higher in the high-ranking (P < 0.05), compared to the low-ranking does.
Plasma progesterone levels were significantly correlated with SI at days 14 and 15 (r = 0.26;
P < 0.05). Results suggest a relationship between social ranking of goats and the plasma
progesterone production from the corpus luteum and other possible sources

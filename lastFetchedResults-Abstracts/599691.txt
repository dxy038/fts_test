The main objective of this study was to determine the effects of Rhizobium and PGPRs on the seed yield and yield components in Chickpea. The experiment was carried out at the RAN Research Station in Firouzkouh in 2011. The treatments consisted of 4 levels of PGPR bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens strain 169, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain153, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain 4 and non-inoculation or control) and 4 level of Rhizobium bactria (Rhizobium CP-31, Rhizobium CP-36, Rhizobium IC-12 and non-inoculation or control). The present results have shown that the highest height, weight of 1000 seeds and seed yield were obtained after applying 8 ton/ha vermicompost. The maximum plant height and biological yield were obtained respectively by using Pseudomonas strain 153 and Rhizobium CP-36. Thus, combined application of Pseudomonas and Rhizobium can be helpful in developing of production and yield in Cicer arietinum.

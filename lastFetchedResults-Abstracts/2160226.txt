Wild type Aeromonas hydrophila (Strain AO1) isolated from the lesions of ulcerative disease syndrome (UDS) affected fish bears a 21 kb virulence plasmid. With plasmid curing the isolates became attenuated and failed to induce fatal haemorrhagic ulcers in fish. The objective of the present work was to check the immunogenicity of these plasmid-cured derivatives and determine whether such strains could be used as candidate antigens for eliciting protective immunity to A. hydrophila infections in the Indian catfish Clarias batrachus L. It was observed that the plasmid-cured strains were immunogenic since infection with live plasmid-cured AO1 isolates generated effective T cell responses and led to increase in serum antibacterial agglutinin titres in C. batrachus. Plasmid-cured AO1 strains injected into C. batrachus could disseminate into head kidney (HK) and spleen but never attained the same bacterial loads obtained with wild type AO1 and were cleared rapidly from the host. Immunisation with plasmid-cured bacteria prevented systemic spread and conferred protection against lethal challenge (10 Ã— LD50) with wild type A. hydrophila as well as other pathogenic strains of Aeromonas sp. These results demonstrate the potentials of plasmid-cured A. hydrophila derivatives as candidate antigens for eliciting protective immunity in fish and the possibility of using such isolates as shuttle vectors in aquaculture.

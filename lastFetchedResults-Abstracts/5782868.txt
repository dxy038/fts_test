A speech pre-processing algorithm is presented to improve the speech intelligibility in noise for the near-end listener. The algorithm improves the intelligibility by optimally redistributing the speech energy over time and frequency for a perceptual distortion measure, which is based on a spectro-temporal auditory model. In contrast to spectral-only models, short-time information is taken into account. As a consequence, the algorithm is more sensitive to transient regions, which will therefore receive more amplification compared to stationary vowels. It is known from literature that changing the vowel-transient energy ratio is beneficial for improving speech-intelligibility in noise. Objective intelligibility prediction results show that the proposed method has higher speech intelligibility in noise compared to two other reference methods, without modifying the global speech energy.

Temperature related inconveniences such as heat stroke, heat rash, frostbite, hypothermia and others, have been a persistent problem for people throughout history. Some of these conditions, when left unchecked, have led to unfortunate deaths. What is even more common is the unsatisfaction that people have with the weather at various points of the year. People often complain that it is either too hot or too cold. The current technological solutions made to keep people thermally comfortable such as air conditioning and heating units have come a long way and have been successful in helping people obtain comfort in their dwellings (e.g. home or car), but are not personal mobility solutions. What if one has to be out in the weather? The addition or subtraction of layers with coats and jackets or beach wear, are popular solutions to that problem, but do not always yield upmost satisfaction, for layers become cold over time and sunburn is a serious problem. This is why a heating/cooling suit is a very beneficial product for the masses. Such a suit allows the user to control and monitor the internal temperature of the suit from high temperatures to low temperatures, depending on the season. Creating the most comfortable thermal environment for the user within an enclosed space of small proximity while providing comfort, practicality and mobility is the objective of this suit. With the use of the thermoelectric effect, microcontroller technology and a bit of ingenuity, this suit can be realized.

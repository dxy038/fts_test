The objective of this paper is the evaluation of a hybrid inorganic/organic polymer type material based on hydrated ferric oxide (HFO), in the adsorption process of arsenic oxyanions from contaminated waters used as drinking water. The study includes rapid small-scale column tests conducted in continuous flow operation in order to assess the arsenic removal capacity in various conditions. Thus it was evaluated the influence of some competing ions like silicate and phosphate on As(V) adsorption and the influence of feed water pH in the removal process of As(V) and As(III) species. Based on the As/pH variation in time at different feed water pH (5, 7 and 9), a possible sorption mechanism that fits the experimental data was suggested. The regeneration and re-use of the hybrid adsorbent was studied in the presence and in the absence of the contaminant ions. The novel hybrid material is very selective towards arsenic oxyanions even though the presence of silica and phosphate reduces the adsorption capacity.

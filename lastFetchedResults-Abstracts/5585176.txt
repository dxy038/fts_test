This paper proposes a method to optimally allocate two types of distributed generation (DG) in the distribution network to maximize the worth of this connection to the Local distribution company (LDC), as well as, the different customers connected to the system. The two types are natural gas based and fuel cell DG units. The fuel cell based DG units represent a renewable dispatchable source of energy, as it is assumed to be supplied by hydrogen, which is extracted from water using wind energy. The benefits considered in this paper are upgrade investmentsÂ´ deferral, cost reduction of energy loss and, finally, reliability improvement, which is represented by cost of interruption. The planning problem of determining the optimal location and sizes of DG units is defined as multi-objective nonlinear problem, and a genetic algorithm (GA) technique is applied to solve the problem.

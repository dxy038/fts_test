The objective of this study was to evaluate genetic and non-genetic factors influencing characteristics of young buck semen production using a multivariate model that takes into account the longitudinal structure of data. Data were collected from 1989 to 2002 at two French A.I. centres. The data corresponded to 13151 and 9206 ejaculates of 758 Alpine and 535 Saanen bucks respectively, collected at the beginning of the first breeding season (September–December). The semen volume, the total number of spermatozoa, the concentration, the motility score of spermatozoa after freezing and the percentage of motile spermatozoa after freezing were registered for each ejaculate. Within-breed heritabilities and repeatabilities were estimated using a multivariate animal model using a power spatial covariance structure for environmental effect. For all characteristics and the two breeds, the main source of variation was the year–month interaction that interacted with the centre. We observed a decrease in years of motility score after freezing. Age and frequency of collection had a significant effect on semen volume and number of spermatozoa for both breeds, and on concentration of spermatozoa for the Alpine breed. No effect of these factors was found on the characteristics observed after freezing. Heritabilities for concentration, number of spermatozoa, semen volume, motility score after freezing and percentage of motile spermatozoa after freezing per ejaculate were respectively, 0.32, 0.15, 0.25, 0.12 and 0.05 for the Saanen breed and 0.34, 0.25, 0.29, 0.17 and 0.03 for the Alpine breed. Genetic correlations between volume and number of spermatozoa were respectively, 0.74 for the Alpine breed and 0.86 for the Saanen breed. Further study is required to compare the semen characteristics of young bucks with their mature production.

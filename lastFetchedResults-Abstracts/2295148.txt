The main objective of the common DLR/ONERA project MIRACLE is to harmonize the CFD activities and strategies of DLR and ONERA in order to better fulfil the future requirements of transport aircraft industry in Europe. The paper presents the most significant achievements of the co-operative activities, which have been focused on the following objectives: collaborative enhancement and industrialization of the structured and unstructured-hybrid CFD solvers elsA (ONERA) and TAU (DLR); validation of both flow solvers elsA and TAU for industrial applications; identification of an appropriate software architecture for next generation CFD tools.

int effort of DLR and ONERA on CFD development has accelerated the enhancement of numerical methods for aerodynamic predictions within conventional and unconventional, environmentally friendly aircraft designs. Both, flow solvers elsA and TAU are routinely used in European aircraft industry. The MIRACLE effort is an important step on the road map to meet the future ambitious goals of aircraft research and industry.

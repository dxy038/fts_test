Future mobile communication systems will need to be reconfigured to support evolving standards and provide new services on demand to mobile terminals. This can be realised by utilising new Software Defined Radio (SDR) technologies. A modular reconfigurable architecture and method of reconfiguration for SDR is presented. The purpose is to allow run-time reconfiguration of the real-time digital processing section of the digital radio. The proposed architecture can be realised in software or hardware depending on the computational complexity, and power requirements of the system. The design and implementation of a multirate Digital IF receiver that can be implemented as reconfigurable modules is also presented. The objective of this design is to maximize flexibility using parameterised modules and minimizing reconfiguration data and time. The long-term objective of this research is to develop flexible low power SDR technologies for mobile terminals, which uniquely integrates the best features of work being conducted in software design with reconfigurable hardware.

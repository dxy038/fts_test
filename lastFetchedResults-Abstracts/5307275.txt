Objective: To investigate the effect of ER-&#945;36 siRNA on the growth of ER-breast cancer cell. Methods: The inhibitive effects of ER-&#945;36 siRNA with various concentration on ER negative breast cancer cell at 24 h and 48 h were determined with MTT, the changes in DNA quantity was detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, the expression levels of ER-&#945;36 and pro-caspase-3 by Western blot. Results: ER-&#945;36 siRNA could inhibited the growth of ER-breast cancer cells lines in vitro. The apoptosis rates at early phase treated with ER-&#945;36 siRNA were 15.5%. The expression of ER-&#945;36 decreased significantly after ER-&#945;36 siRNA treatment. Conclusions: ER-&#945;36 siRNA could induced the apoptosis in ER-&#945;36 dependent manner and had specificity to induce apoptosis of ER negative breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Nowdays using of distributed generation (DG) are growing and regardless of optimum location and size, they can't be useful. In this paper, the HS (Harmony Search) algorithm is used for optimum placement and sizing of DGs in order to decrease the losses and increase the reliability in a standard grid. The proposed method for sizing and sitting of the DG capacities in the grid is so proper and useful in comparison with the conventional method. In suggested procedure, the DG is used to compensate the lost power of several nodes that are disconnected from the grid, while the conventional method tries to compensate the lost power of the node which DG connected to it and so this subject results in optimum value of objective function. The power losses reduction, reliability improvement and a combination of them are objective functions that considered in this paper. In this paper, the simulation results based on mentioned objective functions are presented and compared together. The presented simulation results show the validity and effectiveness of suggested method in optimum placement and sizing of DGs. Some flexibility has been considered in the provided program in order to solve the optimum placement of DGs under real conditions.

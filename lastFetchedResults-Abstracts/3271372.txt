This paper presents analytical techniques for reducing switching losses of voltage source inverter (VSI) using Generalized Discontinuous PWM (GDPWM). The switching losses of inverter is influenced by the angle on the modulation of GDPWM. This problem will be optimized using a new optimization method. This method is called as Spontaneous Evolutionary GA (SEGA). The inverter switching losses is formulated as objective function to optimize the angle. At this optimization process, angle values will be determined to minimize the inverter switching losses. Thermal module of Power Simulator (PSIM) is used to verify the optimized angle of GDPWM. The simulation was performed using a three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) and an inductive load. Simulation results confirm the method could minimize the losses of inverter.

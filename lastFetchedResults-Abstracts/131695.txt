BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Parkinson is a common disease that caused by degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Drug therapy can prevent movement disorders in patients and so they can do independently their daily activities. Many drugs are used for treatment of this disease. This study was done to compare the effect of bromocriptine and selegiline in parkinson' s disease.
METHODS: 77 outpatients (50 were male and 27 were female) with the mean age of 65 years were selected and followed for a three year period. The patients were divided into three groups: levodopa and trihexyphenidyl were administered to all groups but in second and third groups they were given selegiline and bromocriptine, respectively. The patients were evaluated on the basis of United Parkinson's Disease Rate Scale (UPDRS) and consequent visits.
FINDINGS: In this study by considering motor scale, third group in comparison to first group was in a better condition. At first, second group (selegiline) in comparison to first group was in a better condition but by passing a period of time this difference was statistically non- significant. The rate of side effects especially dyskinesia in third group was low.
CONCLUSION: According to the results, bromocriptine as an adjunctive drug is used for treatment of parkinson's disease with levodopa and in comparison to selegiline is more effective.

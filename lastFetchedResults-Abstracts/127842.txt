Introduction & Objective: Several studies have been performed about the association between Helicobacter pylori and gastric carcinoma some of which have confirmed while others have excluded this link. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible connection of gastric carcinoma with Helicobacter pylon infection.
Materials & Methods: We evaluated 70 gastric carcinoma and 70 age and sex matched control subjects (without any mass or ulcer) for H. pylori infection by Geimsa staining of the samples obtained from the subjects.
Results: The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 37.14% in control subjects, 44.44% in intestinal type and 40% in diffuse type of gastric carcinoma.
Conclusion: Statistical analysis did not reveal any meaningful difference between the prevalence of H. pylori in case and control group in this study. Therefore, the relationship between H. pylori and gastric carcinoma was excluded in our study. Atrophy and metaplasia intestine which result in reduction of colonization of bacteria and also bias in sampling might account for the findings of the present study.

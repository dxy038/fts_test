Large-scale integration of rooftop solar power generation is transforming traditionally passive power distribution systems into active ones. High penetration of such devices creates new dynamics for which the current power distribution systems are inadequate. The changing paradigm of power distribution system requires it to be operated as cyber-physical system. A goal-based holonic multiagent system (HMAS) is presented in this paper to achieve this objective. This paper provides details on design of the HMAS for operation of power distribution systems. Various operating modes and associated goals are discussed. Finally, the role of HMAS is demonstrated for two applications in distribution systems. The first one is associated with control of reactive power at solar photovoltaic installations at individual homes for optimal operation of the system. The second deals with the state estimation of the system leveraging different measurements available from smart meters at homes.

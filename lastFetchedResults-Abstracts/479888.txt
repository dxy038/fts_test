Background and Objective:  In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the interrelationships among obsessive- compulsive disorder, impulsivity, and serotonin and previous studies produced mixed results. This study aimed at investigating the comparison of impulsivity between responsive and non-responsive obsessive-compulsive patients to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
Subjects and Methods: In an ex post facto design,  using Sadock and Sadock's (2007) definition, and through convenience sampling, 27 Obsessive-Compulsive patients were divided into two groups (responsive and non-responsive to SSRI) and were examined through 11th Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (symptom checklist), and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.
Results: The mean scores of impulsivity and its components in responsive patients were higher in comparison with non responsive ones. Centroids of responsive and non responsive groups were significantly different regarding impulsivity, attentional, motor, and non-planning impulsiveness (p <  0.009). Among the four variables, there were significant differences only in impulsivity (p < 0.01), attention (p <  0.01) and impulsiveness between responsive and non responsive groups (p  < 0.05).
Conclusion: The findings of this research shows that there is a significant difference in impulsivity level between responsive and non-responsive obsessive-compulsive patients to SSRIs, and the mean score of impulsivity in non-responsive patients is higher. However, attending to some paradoxes in the literature, more researches are needed to provide a comprehensive theoretical explanation for the interrelationships among impulsivity,OCD, and responsivity to SSRIs.

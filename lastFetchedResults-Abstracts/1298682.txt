Abstract
Background: The main objective of this research was to study photocatalytic oxidation of phenol in aquatic solutions by using of UV, TiO2 and the combination of them. Phenol compounds are widely used in industries and other daily life. Highly toxicity and carcinogenicity of these compounds can causal considerable adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystems and human health. 
Methods: The study was an experimental research and carried out by phenol 100 mg L-1 solution and contact time, pH and amount of TiO2 were considered in photocatalytic system as the basic variables affecting removal efficiencies. Phenol concentration in inlet and outlet samples was detected by spec-trophotometery at 500nm. 
Results: Combination of UV and TiO2 can cause higher efficiencies of phenol removal. The removal efficiencies of UV, TiO2 and UV/TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation system with various operation condi-tions had a range of 1.8%-19.64%, 2.38%-17.8% and 34.65%-82.91%, respectively. It was found that increasing of TiO2 concentration and contact time and pH , increasing the amount of phenol that oxi-dized in combined system and maximum removal coefficients obtained in pH=11 , 9 h contact time and 0.2 gr of TiO2.
Conclusion: Combinated UV/TiO2 process may be applied as an effective process for the removal of phenol from aquatic solutions such as industrial wastewaters and polluted water resources.

In this paper, a separation theorem is established firstly. Applying this theorem the relationships between the solutions of a series of inequality systems are discussed. Then a necessary optimality condition without distance function is obtained under a new constraint qualification for a multiobjective programming in which all the objective functions and constraint functions are Lipschitz. Finally, sufficient conditions are studied.

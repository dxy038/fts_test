Although many conventional optimization methods already applied to arch dam shape optimization, these methods impose lots of disadvantages on optimal results at last. A Genetic algorithm (GA) based on float-encoding is presented and applied to closure temperature field and Shape optimization of arch dams. The results of a practical project indicate that GA has an advantage over that by multi-objective non-linear programming method.

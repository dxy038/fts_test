Linear construction projects typically consist of several repetitive activities and have the same operations repeated at each unit. Traditional scheduling techniques are found to be inadequate to solve scheduling problems of such projects. Linear scheduling methods are well suited to the characteristics of linear construction projects. Line-of-Balance is one of these linear scheduling methods. Asphalt highway construction project may be a good example for a linear project. The main objective of this study is to handle the scheduling problem of both on-site and off-site operations of a 4 km long and 14 m wide asphalt highway project using the combination of line-of-balance and discrete event simulation techniques. It is found that the studied project could be completed within at least 17 days using the resources owned by the contractor company. Moreover, the developed simulation model enables the contractor to estimate the arrival times of the trucks that would provide an uninterrupted work flow.

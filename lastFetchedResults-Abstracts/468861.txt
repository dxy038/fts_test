Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare efficacy on fetal lung maturation of intra-amniotic betamethasone or budesonide with the efficacy of maternal intramuscular betamethasone.
Study design
Pregnant ewes received intra-amniotic betamethasone (0.5 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg fetal weight), intra-amniotic budesonide (0.5 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg), maternal intramuscular betamethasone (0.5 mg/kg maternal weight), intra-amniotic saline solution, or maternal saline solution. Lambs were delivered 2 or 7 days later, at 124 days of gestation for measurement of respiratory system compliance, ventilatory efficiency index, and surfactant levels.
Results
Lung function increased 2 days after maternal betamethasone, intra-amniotic betamethasone (2 mg/kg), and intra-amniotic budesonide (2 mg/kg) administration and 7 days after maternal betamethasone or intra-amniotic budesonide (2.0 mg/kg) administration. Lung function was not improved 7 days after intra-amniotic betamethasone (2.0 mg/kg) administration or 2 days after intra-amniotic betamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) or intra-amniotic budesonide (0.5 mg/kg) administration. Intra-amniotic corticosteroid administration increased fetal death and respiratory morbidity.
Conclusion
Intra-amniotic corticosteroid administration improved preterm lung function, but the associated morbidity and mortality rates suggest that they are not suitable for clinical use.

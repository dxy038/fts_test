OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the importance of deoxyribonucleic acid content to long-term survival from advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical and pathologic prognostic factors, including deoxyribonucleic acid content measured by means of flow cytometry, were analyzed for 282 patients. RESULTS: In 80% of the patients, the deoxyribonucleic acid patterns were nondiploid. In univariate analysis stage ( p< 0.0001), residual disease ( p< 0.0001), deoxyribonucleic acid index ( p = 0.01), and deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy ( p = 0.02) significantly predicted progression-free survival. In multivariate analysis stage ( p< 0.001), residual tumor ( p = 0.001), deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy ( p = 0.02), and deoxyribonucleic acid index ( p = 0.02) retained independent prognostic value. Residual disease and deoxyribonucleic acid content retained independent prognostic value for stage III tumors but not for stage IV tumors. CONCLUSION: Deoxyribonucleic acid analysis with flow cytometry provides prognostic information about long-term progression-free survival from advanced ovarian carcinoma and should be considered in the stratification processes of patients in future clinical trials. This prognostic information appears to be inversely related to tumor burden. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:1217-25.)

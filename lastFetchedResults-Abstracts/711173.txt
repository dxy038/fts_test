Objective
The purpose of this paper is to further describe prepubertal distal longitudinal vaginal folds and its natural history.
Design
Biopsy of the folds and follow-up through puberty.
Results
Histology of the folds shows normal vaginal mucosa over loose fibrous connective tissue without a firm fibrous core. The folds disappear in puberty.
Conclusions
Prepubertal distal longitudinal folds are common, and disappear probably by spreading out during puberty with the physiologic estrogenic widening and lengthening of the vagina. This can occur because the folds do not have a dense fibrous core. The folds may be confused with the vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma or sexual molestation if the fold reaches the hymen, and forms a “bump”. The folds are benign.

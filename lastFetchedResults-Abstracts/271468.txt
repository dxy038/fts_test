current study considers the problem of the strain localization as being a dynamic
transition in the range of the correlation length. Using the particle dynamic method within the
framework of statistical physics the proposed model re-examines the assumptions and simplifications
of the traditional, quasi-static, continuum localization theories. Special attention is focused on the
softening regime, “mystery” of the vanishing fault width and the reasons for this “pathological”
result. The proposed model suggests an objective and physically acceptable measure of the fault
“width”. 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved

This paper presents optimal design of simply supported laminated composite plates subject to given in-plane static loads for which the critical failure mode is buckling. The objective function is to maximize the buckling load capacity of laminated plates and the fiber orientation is considered as design variable. The first-order shear deformation theory is used for the finite element analysis. In this paper, the effects of bendingâ€“twisting coupling are also included for the buckling optimization. The modified feasible direction method is used as an optimization method. Also, computer programs are coded in MATLAB and Golden Section method is adapted in this program for the optimal design of laminated plates for maximum buckling load. The effect of width-to-thickness ratio, aspect ratio, number of layers, material anisotropy, load ratios (Ny/Nx), uncertainties in material properties and functionally graded materials on the results is investigated and compared.

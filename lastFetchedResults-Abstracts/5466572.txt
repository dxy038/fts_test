The systematic study of the evaluation reputation system seem to be at he heart of all e-commerce activities that require trust. We found that the fuzzy neural network method has its own advantage of solving e-commerce reputation estimate. In this research, We propose a fuzzy neural network model to determine the weights of estimate index. Then, we presents the sellersÂ´ reputation estimate index system, and gives the fuzzy neural network estimate model. Finally, we trained data which have gained membership degree after quantized and fuzzy disposed. Because the training of the network is an adaptive course, the results of evaluation indices are more objective.

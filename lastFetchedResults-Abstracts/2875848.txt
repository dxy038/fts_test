This paper presents a novel definition for allograph models and recognizing them in machine printed text. The aim of allograph extraction method is to find and collect the allograph from the set of characters. The objective of this paper is to give feature definition of such character primitives which can be used to distinguish the shape characteristic. This paper also proposes a new design for extracting the structural properties of the pattern in machine printed text (only English alphabets from A-Z). The recognition method is tested using multi character random letter sequence.

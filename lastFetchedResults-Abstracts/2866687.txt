Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) has become a recent topic of research in both the Internet and the Telecommunication industry. The terrific increase in popularity of VoIP services is a result of huge growth in broadband usage. Both in wired as well as in wireless communication, VoIP is replacing the traditional telephony techniques. To ensure a good quality speech through VoIP, certain Quality of Service (QoS) parameters must be analyzed. But, the transmission of voice data over VoIP network is challenging task because a packet delayed above a threshold period gets lost. The performance of the VoIP network is highly degraded due to Packet drop, delay, and jitter. Hence more robust techniques are required to upgrade service quality. The vital parameters to measure service quality are packet drop, Delay and Mean Opinion Score (MOS). The objective of this paper is to implement VoIP in a Local Area Network with Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) capabilities, analyze the popular voice CODECÂ´s using QoS parameters and identifying suitable codec techniques for VoIP traffic. OPNET simulator is used to generate real time traffic and simulate IPv6 capable network.

This paper presents the solution of the optimal power flow (OPF) using the simulated annealing (SA) technique. The main goal of this paper is to verify the viability of using SA to solve the OPF problem simultaneously composed by the load flow and the economic dispatch (ED) problem. Definitions on the objective function, weights and norms are given here as well as criteria for solving the load flow. Two test systems (Six and IEEE 30 busses) are used to highlight the goodness of this solution technique

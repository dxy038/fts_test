This paper presents comparisons between different methods used to solve Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem economic dispatch (ED) problem. These methods are Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm from the heuristic methods. Comparisons between these heuristic methods and conventional methods like Interior Point method (IPM) are introduced. The objective function, which consists of the fuel (generation) cost is minimized. Numerical examples typical to each method are introduced. The solutions obtained are quite encouraging and useful in the economic dispatch environment.

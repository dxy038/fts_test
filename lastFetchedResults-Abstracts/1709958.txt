BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coffee plants can alter the activity of liver enzymes and reduce liver enzymes. Considering vital role of liver in the detoxification and the role of dietary factors in enhancing the body's ability to detoxify the chemicals and drugs, the present study was performed to determine the protective effect of boiled coffee on liver enzymes aspartate transaminase )AST(, alanine transaminase )ALT), alkaline phosphatase )ALP(, and total bilirubin in rats treated with thioacetamide. 
METHODS: In this experimental study, 32 male rats were divided into four groups of eight. Animals in the first group (control) received water and normal food for rats, group II (control) received water and normal food associated with the injection of 1 ml of normal saline as a solvent, and the third group received both normal food and water. For injecting thioacetamide (100mg/kg) the treated group received no intervention and the fourth group received boiled coffee (4mg/kg) orally in the diet of rats during 68 days (pretreatment). The average length of treatment time for pretreatment was considered from 8 to 10 weeks. Blood samples were taken at two stages: pretreatment and post injection of thioacetamide intraperitoneally at the dose of 100mg/kg. AST, ALT, ALP and total bilirubin were measured 48 hours after last injection.
FINDINGS: The results showed a significant increase of the rate of serum AST in treated group with thioacetamide (321±26) in compared to control group (162±3). Boiled coffee as pretreatment has protective effect on liver tissue. The rate of ALP in this group was 384±39 that significantly decreased (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In this study, boiled coffee has protective effect on liver enzymes.

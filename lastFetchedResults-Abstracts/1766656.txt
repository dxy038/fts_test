Objective: Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is a major hospital pathogen with a high capacity to resist most common anti-microbial agents. A. baumannii is the etiologic agent for various illnesses including pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections. Biofilm associated proteins (Bap) are specific cell surface proteins essential for the formation of biofilm and play a main role in its pathogenicity. Previously, we have studied various regions of this protein. Considering different criteria, some regions were introduced as conserved and immunogenic. The immunogenicity of one of those regions pertaining to amino acids 706-1076 previously examined has shown that its expression triggers high antibody levels when injected to mice thereby protecting the animals against the bacterium. The present study examines region 4 of the Bap protein in order to validate the previous bioinformatics studies and its immunogenicity.
Methods: In order to obtain immunity against this pathogen, a 1620 bp gene from Bap was amplified and cloned in pET32a. This region from Bap was cloned, expressed and verified by monoclonal antibodies. BALB/c mice were immunized by subcutaneous injection of the pure recombinant protein. Mice immune response was determined by ELISA.
Results: High titer of raised antibodies implied that the recombinant protein was a strong antigen and immunogen. 
Conclusion: The results indicate that this protein can be a suitable choice for developing a new recombinant vaccine against A. baumannii.

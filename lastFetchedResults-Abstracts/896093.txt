Background and Objective: Hepatitis B prevention is  a very important issue in the young women, since it can transfer from mother to infant. This study was aimed to determine factors associated with preventive behaviors of hepatitis B among the high school girls during the academic year 2005-2006 in the Arak, Iran.

Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in five high schools in the Arak city. A total of 590 students from the first and second grades, who agreed to take part in the study, enrolled using a cluster sampling method. The data were collected by a questionnaire, including constructs of perceived severity (15 items), perceived susceptibility (eight items), perceived barriers and benefits (seven items), behavioral intention (10 items), and self-efficiency (two items).

Results: The results showed that the mean age of students was 16.27 ± 0.72 years. Only 5.4% of students had received the hepatitis B vaccination in three intervals and more than one quarter (28.1%) of them were never used their personal equipment when they have gone to the barber salon. The constructs of perceived barriers (p=0.001), perceived susceptibility (p=0.022) and self-efficacy (p=0.001) were significantly associated with preventive behaviors of hepatitis B. The perceived barriers (3.76±0.60) had the maximum score, while self-efficacy (2.13± 0.87) had the minimum score. 

Conclusion: Due to the low range of preventive behaviors of hepatitis B and since these behaviors were associated with constructs of perceived barriers, perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy, adult girls must know about real preventive barriers of this disease and suitable ways have to be prepared to perceive the susceptibility of this disease and developing of self-efficiency.

This article examines the effect of plant entry
and exit in a deregulated ‘energy only’ electricity
market. A partial equilibrium framework
is presented that determines the optimal
portfolio of base, intermediate and peaking
plant for a given electricity load curve. An optimal
result for Queensland is compared
against the actual plant stock. Analysis of the
portfolio indicates that deregulation is failing
a key objective, namely enhancing dynamic efficiency,
because too much base plant has been
delivered. The research presents scenarios of
structural corrections, using the theory of the
generalised war of attrition to develop the
cases. Results from simulation experiments are
clear—consumers will secure lower electricity
prices in the short run. But oversupply of base
plant may suppress prices to such an extent
that they fail to signal timely entry of peaking
plant—the consequence of this failure being
eventual price shocks and, potentially, load
shedding.

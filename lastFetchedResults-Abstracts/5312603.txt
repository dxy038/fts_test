In this paper, we propose a cross-layer optimization scheme for multi-user video streaming over the uplink of IEEE 802.11e HCCA wireless network. The objective is to minimize the energy consumption of all users, including both video encoder energy and wireless transmission energy, while delivering desired video quality for each user. In our proposed scheme, both cross-layer optimization of individual mobile terminal and inter-user resource allocation are carried out, so that the video encoder and wireless transmitter configurations can be jointly steered. Experimental results show that when compared to the transmission system without cross-layer optimization, our proposed scheme is able to reduce total energy consumption from 35% up to 80%, while satisfying the same video quality target.

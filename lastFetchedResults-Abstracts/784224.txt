Objective The aim was to study predictive associations
between childhood stealing behavior at the of age 8 years
with later psychiatric disorders, criminality or suicide
attempts and completed suicides up to the age 25 years in a
large representative population-based birth cohort.
Method The sample includes 2,592 Finnish males born in
1981 with information about stealing from both parents and
teachers. Information about psychiatric disorders, criminality,
suicide attempts requiring hospital admission and
completed suicides was gathered from four different
Finnish nationwide registries until the study participants
were 25 years old.
Results One out of ten boys had stealing behavior during
the previous 12 months. After adjusting for parental education
level and conduct problems or hyperactivity
(i.e. potential confounds), stealing at eight independently
predicted substance use and antisocial personality disorders,
and high level of crimes. Stealing was also associated
with completed suicide or severe suicide attempt
requiring hospital admission. Comorbid stealing and frequent
aggression had the strongest predictive association
with any psychiatric diagnosis, crime and completed
suicide or severe suicide attempt, while stealing without
aggression was not associated with any of the negative
outcomes.
Conclusions Stealing accompanied with aggressivity at
age eight is predictive of wide range of adversities. However,
no increased risk was observed among the group with
stealing behaviors but without aggression.

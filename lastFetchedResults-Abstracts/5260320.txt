A hardware and software co-design method for the image processing system of intelligent transport systems (ITS) is proposed. The objective of this method is to optimize the division of functions between hardware and software by the optimum tradeoff. In this method, the targeted overall system is first modeled by software, and then functions and structures are adjusted. The performance of each function of software and hardware in the model is evaluated by simulation, and the optimized division of functions between hardware and software is obtained. Each functionally divided process of hardware and software is re-designed and fine-tuned and then operations are verified by the co-design test board in order to quickly design and construct a system which satisfies the design objectives. The ITS image processing development area is chosen as an application example for this method and its effectiveness is verified by evaluating the construction of a safe driving support system

One of the major arguments discussed in social and cultural semiotics is the question of norms and semiotic codes. In fact, the individual defines him/herself - in society to which he belongs - through the semiotic codes he produces. What the individual generates as his semiotic codes (behavioral, linguistic or clothing) not only tends to define him positively, but it also defines him negatively, for it shows how he fails to belong to other social groups. 
What is principally discussed in this article is to distinguish two types of norms: objective norm and evaluative norm. Afterwards, it aims to point to two forces â€“ centrifugal and centripetal- that result in separation or fusion of the semiotic codes. Considering these two objective and evaluative norms, two social phenomena including security semiotics and insecurity semiotics will be explained. Eventually, this writing elaborates on the phenomena of silence, hypercorrection, compensation and semiotic confusion, that are raised as reactions to the phenomenon of insecurity semiotics. Clearly to make theses idioms more comprehensible, different examples will be presented from various fields, specifically literary field.

Conventional image and video communication systems are usually designed with the objective being to maximize the fidelity of reconstructed images measured by mean square errors (MSE). It is well known that the fidelity metric MSE may not reflect the visual quality perceived by human eyes. Recent advancements in image quality assessment tell us that the structural similarity (SSIM), especially the gradient similarity, reveals the perceptual fidelity of images more reliably. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposes a new image communication approach, which conveys the visual information in an image by transmitting the image gradients and recovers the image from the received gradient data at decoder side using statistical image prior knowledge. In particular, we designed a gradient-based image SoftCast scheme for wireless scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can produce reconstruction images with much better perceptual quality. The advantage in perceptual quality is verified by the quality improvement measured by the metrics SSIM and gradient signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR).

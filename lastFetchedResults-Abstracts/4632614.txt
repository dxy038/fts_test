This paper presents a new approach to optimal zoning design. The approach uses a multi-objective genetic algorithm to define, in a unique process, the optimal number of zones of the zoning method along with the optimal zones, defined through Voronoi diagrams. The experimental tests, carried out in the field of handwritten digit recognition, show the superiority of new approach with respect to traditional dynamic approaches for zoning design, based on single-objective optimization techniques.

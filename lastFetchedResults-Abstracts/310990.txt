Objective.  The purpose of this investigation was to determine if postures of the lower extremity were related to the amount of anterior tibial translation.

Design. Regression model of lower extremity postural measures used to predict the amount of tibial translation for a sample of convenience.

Background. Retrospective studies have indicated a link between certain lower extremity postures and prediction of anterior cruciate ligament injury status. What is not clear is whether these lower extremity postures cause, or occur as a result of anterior cruciate ligament injury.

Methods. Genu recurvatum, the thigh–foot angle, and navicular drop measures were obtained from the right leg of 43 uninjured college-aged subjects. Tibial translation was determined using a KT-1000 arthrometer. Gender related differences were determined with independent t-tests. Step-wise regression was performed to assess the relationship between postural measures and subject gender, and tibial translation.

Results. Very good to excellent inter- and intra-rater reliability was found for the postural measures. There was greater tibial translation (P=0.01) in females. The final regression model indicated a moderate relationship between sex of the subject, navicular drop and tibial translation (r=0.551). Genu recurvatum and thigh–foot angle were not significant predictors of tibial translation.

Conclusions. We concluded that foot pronation has a greater impact on the amount of tibial translation than genu recurvatum and torsion of the lower leg in anterior cruciate intact subjects.

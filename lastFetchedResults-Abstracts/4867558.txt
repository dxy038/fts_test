The main objective of this paper is the dynamic self-sensing of the motion of piezoelectric actuators. The proposed measurement technique is afterwards used for a closed-loop control. Aiming to obtain a self-sensing scheme that estimates the transient and steady-state modes of the displacement, we extend a previous static self-sensing scheme by adding a dynamic part. Analytical solutions are provided to compute the gains of this dynamic part. Afterwards, the proposed dynamic self-sensing result is used in a closed-loop control. The experimental results demonstrate the concept and evaluate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed technique for closed-loop applications.

Aiming to relating the Farad to the Ohm, reproduced at Centro Nacional de Metrologia (CENAM) by means of the Quantized Hall Effect (QHE), a development project was planed. The results of the construction of a capacitance bridge that constitutes the first step to achieve this objective are presented.

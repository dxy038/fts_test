OBJECTIVE: Tumor angiogenesis is believed to be a prognostic indicator associated with tumor growth and metastasis. Studies of angiogenesis in breast, prostate, and lung cancer, as well as melanoma, have shown that neovascularization correlates with the likelihood of metastasis and recurrences. The purpose of this study was to evaluate microvessel density as a prognostic factor in endometrial cancer. METHODS: Between 1980 and 1991 the tumor registry identified 25 patients with a diagnosis of recurrent endometrial cancer. These patients were matched with 25 patients with nonrecurrent disease for age, stage, grade, and treatment. The histologic slides of the 50 patients were reviewed. The paraffin blocks were obtained, and the area of the deepest myometrial invasion was selected for staining. The microvessels within the invasive cancer were highlighted by means of immunocytochemical staining to detect factor VIII - related antigen. Microvessels were counted by two investigators who were blinded to the patients' clinical status. Survival data were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: Microvessel count was related to likelihood of recurrence, although this trend did not reach statistical significance. Patients with tumors of low capillary density had a mean survival time of 123 months. Patients with tumors of high capillary density had a mean survival time of 75 months (p = 002). Among patients with recurrent disease, those with a low capillary count survived a mean of 64 months. Patients with recurrent disease with tumors of high capillary density survived a mean of 45 months (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Angiogenesis factor correlates with survival in endometrial carcinoma.

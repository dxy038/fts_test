Cellular Automata is significantly applying to image processing operations. The description about the use of training of cellular automata for filtering the salt and pepper noise in binary images is exemplified in this paper. The selection of the best rule set from large search space has been performed on the basis of sequential floating forward search method. The peak signal to noise ratio values between original and filtered image is used as the objective function. The proposed method is also compared with some standard methods and found to perform better in respect to restoration of the image.

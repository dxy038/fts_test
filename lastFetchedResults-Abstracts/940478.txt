A mercury-cell chlor-alkali plant operated in Estarreja (North-western Portugal) for 50 years causing widespread environmental contamination. Although production by this process ceased in 2002, mercury contamination from the plant remains significant. The main objective of this study was to investigate mercury impact on the nearby environment and potential risks to local population. To assess the level of contamination soil samples were collected from agricultural fields in the vicinity of the plant, extending the study by taking samples of the predominant vegetation suitable for animal and human consumption, water samples, and fish species from a nearby coastal lagoon, to gain a preliminary insight into the potential for contamination of the terrestrial and aquatic food web. To determine population exposure to mercury, hair samples were collected from local residents. Total mercury concentration in the 0–15 cm layer of soil was found to be highly variable, ranging between 0.010 and 91 mg kg− 1, although mercury contamination of soils was found to be restricted to a confined area. Lolium perenne roots contained between 0.0070 and 2.0 mg kg− 1, and there is evidence that root systems uptake mercury from the soil. Levels of mercury in the aerial parts of plants ranged between 0.018 and 0.98 mg kg− 1. It appears that plants with higher mercury concentration in soils and roots also display higher mercury concentration in leaves.

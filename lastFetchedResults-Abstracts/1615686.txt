The work is a presentation of the use of a continuous stirred tank reactor with feedback control to maintain the biomass concentration in desired range. Through analysis of the model’s nonlinear dynamics and numerical performance simulations, conditions are obtained for the existence of the system’s positive period-1 solution. The analysis also indicates that the system is not chaotic. Based on the model’s analysis, it is demonstrated that the selection of suitable operating conditions for the continuous stirred tank reactor can be simplified. This offers the possibility of establishing more general and systematic operations and control strategies that are based on the counteraction of the mechanisms which underlie the adverse effects of the bioreactor dynamics. Moreover, in the article the new objective function is introduced and the aspect of advanced optimization of the biomass productivity is presented.

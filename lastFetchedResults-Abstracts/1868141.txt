Secreted proteins are considered to have an important role in inducing resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We analyzed the proliferation of PBMC from five healthy tuberculin-positive individuals, four tuberculosis patients, and six tuberculin-negative healthy controls to the whole bacilli, the 38- and 10-kDa-secreted antigens, and the 65- and 71-kDa hsp. Comparing the proliferative responses between the two mycobacterial-secreted proteins, we have found that both the 38- and the 10-kDa antigens were recognized by PBMC from healthy tuberculin-positive individuals. However, the magnitude of the proliferation caused by the 10-kDa antigen was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.005) THAN THAT WITH THE 38-KDA PROTEIN. IT WAS A FINDING OF IMPORTANCE THAT PROLIFERATION TO THE 10-KDA ANTIGEN WAS COMPARABLE TO THAT ELICITED BY THE WHOLE BACILLI. CHARACTERIZATION OF PROLIFERATIVE RESPONSES TOWARD THE 10-KDA ANTIGEN DEMONSTRATES THAT HUMAN CELLS PROCESS THE 10-KDA ANTIGEN PRIOR TO ITS RECOGNITION BY T CELLS, AND THAT THIS PROCESS MIGHT BE THROUGH LYSOSOMAL PATHWAYS. THESE DATA CONFIRM THE STRONG T CELL RESPONSE AGAINST THE M. tuberculosis 10-kDa antigen and demonstrate, for the first time, characterization of cellular activation toward this antigen. The magnitude of the proliferative responses to the 65-kDa hsp in the healthy tuberculin-positive subjects compared with tuberculosis patients was not significantly different (P &gt; 0.01). Finally, PBMC from the healthy tuberculin-positive individuals did not recognize the M. tuberculosis 71-kDa hsp. In summary, human resistant cells to tuberculosis respond to different classes of antigens, including constitutive cell wall proteins, secreted antigens, and hsp.

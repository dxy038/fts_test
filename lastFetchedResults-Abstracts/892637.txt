Present study describes the approach of applying Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with a Pareto-based multi-objective genetic algorithm to assist engineers in optimization of sheet metal forming. In many studies, Finite element analysis and optimization technique have been integrated to solve the optimal process parameters of sheet metal forming by transforming multi objective problem into a single-objective problem. This paper aims to minimize the objective functions of fracture and wrinkle simultaneously. Design variables are blank-holding force and draw-bead geometry (length and Diameter). Response surface model has been used for design of experiment and finding relationships between variables and objective functions. Forming Limit Curve (FLC) has been used to define the objective functions. Finite element analysis applied for simulating the forming process. Proposed approach has been investigated on a cross-shaped cup drawing case and it has been observed that it is more effective and accurate than traditional finite element analysis methods and the ‘trial and error’ procedure.

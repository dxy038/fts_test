
Objective: The objective of this study was analyzing the effect of meta-cognition elements on
depression, trait and state anxiety symptoms. Methods: In this Study, the sample consisted of 224 students of University of Social Welfare
and Rehabilitation Sciences that answered three questionnaires including Metacognitive
Questionnaire (MCQ-30), Beck Depression inventory (BDI-II) and Spielberger State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory. Pearson correlation coefficient and step-by-step regression to analyze were
used for data analysis. Results: According to the results, there is a positive and significant correlation between
total score of metacognition and four elements of beliefs (positive beliefs, negative beliefs,
uncontrollability and low cognitive trust (P<0.01). In addition, summary of results indicated
that out of metacognitive elements, only general negative beliefs may predict the variations of
depression scores, (P<0.01). Conclusion: Summary of this study demonstrated that metacognitive beliefs are significantly
effective on prediction of depression and anxiety. Moreover, out of metacognitive elements,
only general negative beliefs, in comparison with other elements, may predict the depression.

A new series of diarylmethylnapthyloxy ethylamines were synthesized by aminoalkylation of diarylmethylnaphthols which were obtained by Friedel–Crafts alkylation on 1- and 2-naphthols using diarylcarbinols as the alkylating agents. The title compounds were evaluated for antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in vitro and showed MIC in the range of 3.12–25 μg/ml.

MUSIC COLORZ is a wireless LEDs control system. As light and music play have major role in house, the presented idea is to create a lighting atmosphere which would be in total harmony with the music played (from a MP3 player, for example). Nonetheless, we realized a remote for a user interface that can switch colors, variations and intensities through different modes (manual or music). The system is built around Texas solutions: DSP C6x, MSP430 and SympliciTI RF. One objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of the system, using only TI solutions. It has been developed by INSA of Rennes engineerÂ´s students during one year.

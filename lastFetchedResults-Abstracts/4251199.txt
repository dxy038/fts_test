This paper describes the design and implementation of an interactive rehabilitation system for balance exercises on a spherical cap. The balance exercises are used to restore the function of the locomotor system after previous injury or disease. During this exercise, the patient performs several basic exercises under constant supervision and guidance of a physiotherapist. The quality of rehabilitation and its progression is usually evaluated only subjectively by physiotherapist. The proposed rehabilitation system is used for objective evaluation of the quality of rehabilitation and its progression. It consists of a wireless telemetric spherical cap and rehabilitation software. The main aim of this work was to design an online system for displaying the patientÂ´s position or the angular deflection on the computer screen during the rehabilitation.

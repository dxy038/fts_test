Data aggregation in sensor network can improve both efficiency and privacy of network traffic.Recent work in integrity-assured data aggregation has considered aggregation as only an efficiency primitive. In this work, we address for the first time the problem of integrity-assured data aggregation with efficiency and privacy as a joint objective. Our solutions show the inherent tension between privacy-preservation and integrity-assurance of data aggregation.

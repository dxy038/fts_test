Objective
Fortification of food with iron is considered the best sustainable way of preventing iron deficiency when an appropriate diet is not available. The most difficult challenge is to find the ideal combination of iron fortification compound and food vehicle. We investigated the effect of cheese whey drink with 15% of frozen strawberry fortified with ferrous bisglycinate on hemoglobin values in children and adolescents.
Methods
The assessed population participates in Public Educational Centers in Londrina, Paraná (southern Brazil), which assist families living in precarious socioeconomic conditions (annual income < US $500.00 per capita). Hemoglobin was measured for 1 y with a Hemocue portable photometer. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin values below 12 g/dL. Thus, hemoglobin was verified in 467 (7 to 14 y) individuals (249 boys and 218 girls).
Results
Although anemia prevalence did not decrease after 3 mo, there was a statistically significant decrease from 41.9% at the beginning of the study to 26.4% after 6 mo (P < 0.001) and to 9.6% after 1 y (P < 0.001). Statistically significant changes (mean ± standard deviation) were observed between children and adolescents with hemoglobin values below 11 g/dL (increase of 2.2 ± 1.03) and above 12 g/dL (increase of 0.35 ± 1.07; P < 0.0001).
Conclusion
There was a marked reduction in the prevalence of anemia in children and adolescents after long-term fortification of whey drink with ferrous bisglycinate.

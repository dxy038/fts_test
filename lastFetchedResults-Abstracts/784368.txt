Objective: To investigate the validity of a patient kept food diary in relation to weighted intakes and to
measure dietary intakes of older people both in hospital and after discharge at home. Design: A randomly
selected cohort of hospitalised elderly patients was recruited. All patients were instructed how to keep a record
of all food and drink consumed and any leftovers. Food diaries were kept for up to seven days in hospital and for
seven days in the community. In 18 consecutive patients dietary records were compared with weighed intake.
Setting: Associate Teaching Hospital, United Kingdom. Results: A total of 116 patients participated in the study
(median age 77 years, range 66-86 yrs; 49 female). We found significant correlations between food diary and
weighted macronutrient intakes both in hospital and in the community. Overall the food diary predicted within
Â±17% weighted energy intakes in 70% of individuals. Compared with the National Diet and Nutrition Survey for
free-living elderly people in the UK (1998), we found more or less similar energy and micronutrient intakes in
hospital, but lower intakes at home. Conclusion: Patients kept food diaries can be used to identify those at risk of
undernutrition and monitor those on nutritional support. It can also be used for nutritional education and for
achieving dietary goals.

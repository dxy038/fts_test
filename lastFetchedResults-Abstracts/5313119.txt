In this paper, we consider the cooperative driving of an automobile platoon in the longitudinal direction under the bidirectional information architecture, i.e., the cruise control makes use of the distances to the follower as well as to the predecessor. The framework of LTI systems with generalized frequency variables has been employed in the performance analysis in terms of D-stability and H<sub>2</sub>-norm. A closed-form solution is derived, giving the best achievable D-stability of the bidirectional architecture. The analysis results reveal how one should balance between the control actions associated with the predecessor and the follower. The simulation results confirm that the suggested parameter setting is effective in a platoon merging scenario.

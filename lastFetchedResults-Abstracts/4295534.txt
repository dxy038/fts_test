The first step, Nash equilibrium solution of multi-party decision-makers was calculated when the non-cooperative game. The second step, under the certain constraints, the consultation countermeasures of multi-party decision-makers in the cooperative game was found, and then, the pareto optimal of the consultation countermeasures was consulted. And, it was applied in a case of one construction engineering company to find a Pareto optimal solution to the enterprise competitive capability system target of alienation of negotiation. The results show that the pareto optimal policy can weaken the alienation problem of enterprise competitive system´s goals, and the payments and allocations of all competitive units are satisfactory.

We propose to address the critical issue pertaining to the energy consumption in data centers, which are the essential backbone of various IT functionalities provided over the Internet. We carry out extensive investigations on the avenues to reduce the energy cost incurred by the cloud service providers which run the requests from the customers subject to compliance with the predetermined Service Level Agreement (SLA). Secondly, we consider the social issue of increasing the renewable energy penetration into the grid. We achieve both the economical objective of energy cost reduction and social objective of increasing the penetration of renewable energy by employing a price and renewable aware load distribution algorithm. We formulate and solve a convex optimization problem, for which there exist computationally efficient algorithms. We carry out rigorous simulation experiments and demonstrate that our proposed method substantially outperforms other commonly employed algorithms.

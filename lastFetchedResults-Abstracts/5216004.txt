This paper describes both the design and technical integration of a deep water ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) that is able to employ visual inspection in deep water, as well as to take samples with an underwater arm. Visual inspection is the essential application for a ROV, which is useful for; underwater structure inspection, underwater oil production systems inspection and underwater pipeline inspection. This paper mainly describes the ROV design, and explains in general manner other elements; such as the SCU, LARS and TMS. It is important to mention that the design phase is complete and it was financed by PEMEX (Federal Mexican Oil Company). The project has stalled, since we are waiting for the financial support from PEMEX for the system construction. A future objective is the design and construction of Work-Class ROVs, which can be used to perform PEMEX specific tasks.

Reliability is a main technical index for aircraft of long life cycle and long storage period. Periodic test is a reasonable confirmation for keep a good reliability of aircraft system. If inspection and maintenance periodically is too long or short, it may exercise an influence upon low reliability and high economy. So, the optimal testing period is the effective way for a good reliability of aircraft if it could test cycle based on the reliability changes on life cycle. Because any action can influence the reliability on any life span, especially for the profile of plant test, deploy test and storage test. The variations of reliability have an important influence for testing period. Based on the principle of storage, the aircraft was divided into two categories: test or un-test. For the periodical detecting subsystems, the reliability models according to the examination node, test ability and the cost for test &amp; maintenance are analyses on the basis of the rules that the reliability or failure rate is different on different life-cycle profile and environment. According to optimization theory, an optimal testing cycles model are established based on constraint function of the reliability and objective function of the life cycle cost for aircraft. The results can help for quality management and use of equipment.

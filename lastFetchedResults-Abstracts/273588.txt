The primary objective of the present paper is to analyze the influence of interface stress on the elastic field within a
nano-scale inclusion. Special attention is focused on the case of non-hydrostatic eigenstrain. From the viewpoint of practicality,
it is assumed that the inclusion is spherically shaped and embedded into an infinite solid, within which an axisymmetric
eigenstrain is prescribed. Following Goodier s work, the elastic fields inside and outside the inclusion are obtained
analytically. It is found that the presence of interface stress leads to conclusion that the elastic field in the inclusion is not
only dependent on inclusion size but also on non-uniformity. The result is in strong contrast to Eshelby s solution based on
classical elasticity, and it is helpful in the understanding of relevant physical phenomena in nano-structured solids.

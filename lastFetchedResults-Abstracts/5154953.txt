The main objective of this work is to study the effect of low pulsed microwaves on heart rate variability signals derived from electrocardiogram signals( ) of ten cats. The cats were irradiated with rectangular pulsed microwaves at . , peak, . us wide and repetition rate applied to their brains through horns and wave guides for min followed by a min recovery period after exposure. The results clearly indicate that the pulsed microwaves radiation induced high fluctuations in power spectra of heart rate variability signal( R ) specially in the band of s to s ( . to . ) which is related to the thermoregulatory control activity, examining the power spectra of R of recovery period (after min microwave exposure) shows that change of power spectra of R signals during microwave exposure is not permanent.

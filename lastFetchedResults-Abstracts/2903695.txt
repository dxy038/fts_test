In this paper, a study about wireless sensor network (WSN) deployment strategy is demonstrated and made workable for the use of multi-objective approach. The development of sensor nodes by considering multiple objectives and existence of fixed obstacles is an important optimization problem. There are two objectives in this study, connectivity and coverage as two fundamental issues in wireless sensor networks deployment. In this work a multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is proposed to address this problem. Two proposed functions, ranking function and fitness function, are used to determine the best optimal solution from Pareto optimal fronts. Further we presented simulation and analysis to verify and validate the deployment of wireless sensor network in area with the presence of permanent obstacles.

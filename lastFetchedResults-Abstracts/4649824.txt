The objective of this research is to automatically detect and locate devices-of-interest (DOI) in x-ray images, even if partially obscured by devices of no interest, using a new ALISA Component Module. This preliminary study was performed using a single DOI, a 9mm Colt Beretta, but the solution method can easily accommodate other DOIs. Results obtained in real-time (a few seconds) revealed a robust and accurate classifier that could easily assist security personnel at the defined venue: carry-on luggage x-ray machines in airports. This research project was funded by the defense threat reduction agency (DTRA).

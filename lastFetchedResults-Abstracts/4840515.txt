China is a natural disaster-prone country and the natural disasters cause huge casualties and property losses. Among them, The losses caused by emergency logistics like emergency relief supplies and emergency personnel account for 15 to 20 percent. Emergency relief supplies logistics activities are significantly different from general commercial logistics. This paper firstly puts forward the different characteristics between natural disaster rescue emergency logistics and general commercial logistics supplies, and then analyzes the system structure of this special logistics problem. It emphatically studies the whole logistics process of dispatching vehicles available at local garages to transport relief goods from each warehouse to hit points under one kind of transport mode. On this foundation, establishes a mathematics model with the objective of minimizing vehicles total distributing time and designs an improved Genetic Arithmetic according to this model. At the end of this paper, a simple example is cited and testified by making use the genetic arithmetic toolbox of MATLAB7.0.

A planar passive array feed antenna for bidirectional Ku band satellite communication was designed, fabricated and measured. The feed antenna achieved 50 dB isolation between transmit and receive ports across the transmitting band. An on-reflector test was conducted by mounting the array feed with external low noise amplifier and block downconverter (LNB) on a 90 cm dish to verify the feed radiation efficiency and illumination pattern. The measured signal to noise ratio (SNR) with the planar feed including loss in test connectors was within 2 dB of that of a commercial horn feed.

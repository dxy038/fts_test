The configuration of a repairable system directly influences its performance measures, such as mean time between failures and steady state availability. Additionally, maintenance strategies such as corrective, preventive, and condition-based can affect the performance of the system. The objective of this work is to investigate the trade-offs between the configuration of a repairable multi-state system with binary components and its maintenance strategy. The corresponding stochastic process for the proposed model is formulated using the continuous-time Markov process and important performance measures of such a multi-state system are derived. An optimization model is introduced for the cost-effective design of this repairable multi-state system. The results are demonstrated using a numerical example for a power generation system.

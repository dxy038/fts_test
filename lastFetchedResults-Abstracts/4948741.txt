A sequence of BCU classifiers for on-line dynamic contingency screening is developed based on the modified BCU implementation. The theoretical basis for these classifiers is provided. The design objective of the BCU classifiers is to ensure that unstable (single-swing or multi-swing) contingencies be completely captured and that the number of contingencies needed for further analysis be significantly reduced. The effectiveness of the developed BCU classifiers and the proposed architecture is evaluated-using 1668 contingencies on a 50-generator, 145-bus power system with very promising results

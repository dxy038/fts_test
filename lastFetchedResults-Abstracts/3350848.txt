Sound pressure and particle velocity are used to reproduce sound signals in multichannel systems. The two sound properties were estimated step by step and particle velocity was scaled due to ill-conditioned equations in Ando´s study. We explore a new system of equations to maintain both sound pressure and particle velocity. The weight equations are solved in a non-traditional way to figure out exact solutions. Based on the proposed method, the perception of the direction of a sound event and the distance to the listening point are both reproduced correctly in a three-dimension reproduction system. The comparison between the proposed method and Ando´s method is outlined and the proposed method is more flexible and useful. Objective evaluation shows the wavefront in the proposed method is more accurate than Ando´s method and subjective evaluation confirms that the proposed method improves the spatial perception of sound events.

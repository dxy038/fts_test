In this paper, a tabu search (TS)-based approach to provide decision support in the problem of capacitor location in radial distribution networks is presented. The model explicitly considers two conflicting and incommensurate objective functions related to cost and operational aspects of evaluation. This offers the decision maker/planning engineer the possibility to expand the range of potential alternative solutions (since he or she is not limited to an optimal solution as in single objective models), also giving him or her an active role through the expression of his or her preferences to select a satisfactory compromise solution.

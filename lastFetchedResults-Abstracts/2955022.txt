Preliminary results of an attempt at correlation between objective parameters computed on video compressed sequences and subjective scores are reported. The measurement of the objective parameters is performed on sub-areas of the frame singled out taking into account spatial information and motion detection. The results show that the division of the frame into sub-areas can improve correlation performances provided by objective measurements; future planned studies are also reported

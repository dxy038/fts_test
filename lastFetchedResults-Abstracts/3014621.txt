This paper shows in detail the study of a photovoltaic power processing and control circuit with the objective to maintain a photovoltaic module at the maximum power point using the maximum power ratio technique-MPRT. This function is accomplished by controlling the photovoltaic module voltage through the current drained from the module. The circuit is implemented using a DC-DC converter in buck configuration. The power stage, the control strategy, the systemÂ´s operation principle and the simulation results are presented. In order to confirm the performance of the system, the experimental results acquired with the prototype constructed in laboratory also are shown.

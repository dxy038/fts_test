In this paper, a statistical study of the switching overvoltages (SOVs) of Kuwait EHV (275 kV) is presented. The statistical simulations include different types of faults (L-G, LL-G, 3L-G, L-L), line energization and successful line reclosure. The EMTP program is used to simulate the network for this study. The probability distributions for both system overvoltages and insulation breakdown are deduced. The objective is to determine the risk of system insulation failure at the critical spots of the system, and accordingly, to assess the system insulators which are currently in use. Surge arresters are introduced in the network in order to assess their effect in reducing the risk of failure of the insulation.

Background: Tinea pedis is the most common fungal infection in adults. It is a common problem in communal areas such as swimming pools and hotels.
Objective: To determine the frequency of tinea pedis in adult Muslims regularly attending mosques and to compare it with a control group
Patients & Methods: In a case-control study in 4 randomly selected mosques in Kerman, 99 adult Muslims praying in the mosque at least once a day on at least 5 days a week and 101 Muslims praying less than once a month in mosque (as control), were clinically examined for tinea pedis. Clinically suspicious individuals were further subjected to skin scraping for direct smear and culture.
Samples were also taken from 12 areas of the carpets of mosques for direct smear and culture.
Results: Only 6 individuals (3 in each group) had clinical signs of fungal infection and the culture confirmed diagnosis in 2 of them ( one in each group). Smears and cultures from carpets were all negative.
Conclusion: We did not find any differences in tinea pedis between Muslims regularly praying in mosques and the control group.

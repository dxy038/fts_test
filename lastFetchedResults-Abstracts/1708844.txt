It is essential to study and optimize multiple objective functions such as binder system design, feedstock, part geometry, mold design, and processing conditions in order to develop a successful powder injection molding process. A powder with different combinations of binder systems and a binder system with different combinations of powder systems were investigated with a combined experimental and simulation study. First, an experimental rheological study was performed to evaluate the influence of the powder/binder combinations on the rheological behavior and thermal stability of carbonyl iron and stainless steel powder injection molding (PIM) feedstocks. Second, based on the characterization of the feedstock, the simulation study revealed that the pressure-related parameters such as wall shear stress, injection pressure, and clamping force were mainly dependent on the binder system and not much on the powder characteristics, in the range of particle attributes studied. Third, to the temperature-related parameters such as melt front temperature difference and cooling time, binder selection is more critical than powder selection. Fourth, for the velocity-related parameter, maximum shear rate, the selection of both powder and binder system is critical in control. It is demonstrated that the simulation study is essential in the development stage for successful PIM.

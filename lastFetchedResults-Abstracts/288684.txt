Objective and importance: We report the case of a 73-year-old patient who presented a right motor deficit caused by an ipsilateral acute subdural hematoma. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstration of Kernohanâ€“Woltman notch phenomenon was obtained. Clinical presentation: The woman sustained a major head injury at home, followed by loss of consciousness. On admission to the emergency room, she was comatose, anisochoric (left>right), and showed a reaction to pain with decerebrating movements of left limbs (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 4/15). A right severe hemiparesis was observed. Cerebral computed tomography scan showed a large right hemispheric subdural hematoma. Intervention and post-operative course: A wide right craniotomy was performed and the subdural hematoma evacuated. During the post-operative period, the level of consciousness gradually improved. A MRI performed about 2 weeks after operation showed a small area of abnormal signal intensity in the left cerebral peduncle. On discharge, the woman was able to communicate with others, but her right hemiparesis was still severe.

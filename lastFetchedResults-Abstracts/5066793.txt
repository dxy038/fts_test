Educational web sites can be used as supporting learning tools for students that wish to supplement their knowledge without restrictions of time and place. The objective of this work is to propose a methodology for improving the mobile learners´ web experience and provide personalized presentation of educational content. The proposed approach results in recommending relevant links to the users´ interests, by exploiting the logs of the educational portal and the semantics of the learning content.

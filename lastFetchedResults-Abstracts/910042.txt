Several best management practices (BMPs) have been implemented through Water Quality Management Plans (WQMPs) in the
West Fork Watershed of Trinity River Basin in Texas, USA, where nonpoint source pollution is a serious concern. Major sources of
pollution are sediment erosion and nutrients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term impact of implementation of
WQMPs on nonpoint source pollution at the farm level and watershed level using a modeling approach. The Soil and Water
Assessment Tool watershed model was applied to quantify the impacts of implementing WQMPs on sediment and nutrients. A pre-
BMP scenario representing conditions of the watershed prior to the implementation of WQMPs, and a post-BMP scenario
representing the conditions of the watershed after implementation of WQMPs were simulated to estimate the reductions in nonpoint
source pollution due to WQMP implementation. The results are presented as percentage reductions in sediment and nutrient
loadings, at the farm level and at two locations within the watershed. The results revealed that (a) the benefits of the WQMPs were
greater (up to 99%) at the farm level and (b) the benefits due to WQMPs were 1e2% at the watershed level. Watershed level benefits
are tangible as the WQMP implementation area is very small compared to the watershed area. An additional scenario was evaluated
to show the possible impacts of expanding the current BMP effort on load reductions. This study showed that a modeling approach
can be used to estimate the impacts of water quality management programs in large watersheds.

Today, SAR interferometry plays an important role in the observation of the Earth. It enables the generation of digital elevation models. Differential interferometry allows the determination of uplifting and subsidence and coherence is utilized for land use classification purposes. Most of today´s radar satellites deliver data suitable for SAR interferometry. New missions will provide continuation of this capability. DLR´s German Remote Sensing Data Center is implementing an operational SAR interferometry processing system, currently supporting ERS SAR data. It will be further developed for ESA´s ERS follow on system ENVISAT as well as for the SRTM mission (Shuttle Radar Topography Mapper). The main objective is the operational interferometric derivation of DEMs to fill a global elevation data base. These DEMs are utilized for the terrain correction of amplitude images. Interferograms as base products for, for example, differential interferometry as well as coherence maps will be available for the repeat pass interferometry missions

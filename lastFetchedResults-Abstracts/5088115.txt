This paper contains a strategy to minimize energy losses in an electrical distribution network. In order to develop the strategy, a model was constructed to simulate an electrical distribution network, and different parameters were included that help in estimation of technical losses in medium voltage (MV) distribution network. The main objective of this paper is to minimize technical and non-technical losses in power systems. There are losses in power systems that cannot be predicted or calculated beforehand, these are the nontechnical losses. The bulk of these losses are likely caused by electricity theft, rather than the other possibilities such as poor maintenance of meters, and calculation and accounting mistakes, some power systems may suffer from both. The strategy is applied on a part of real distribution network. The network segments consist of different network busses delivering electrical energy from substation to supply different customers. In this network, the load supplied by one bus is a varying load for different times especially at maximum load conditions.

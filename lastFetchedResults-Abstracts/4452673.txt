The goal of the project described in this paper was to explore the possibility of developing an automatic system for treating contents based on user analysis and mobile scenarios, using HCI methodologies to design the output, with the objective to increase students´ satisfaction. Consequently, the contents´ edition would need to be independent of their output format. Empirical HCI methods were then used to design the user scenarios which correspond these formats.

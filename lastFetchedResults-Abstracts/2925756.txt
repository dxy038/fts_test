Bowater Containers (heavy duty) Ltd (BCHD) was registered to AQAP4 from the start of production, in 1981, and gained ISO 9002 in 1987. Implementing a formal quality system was seen as a first step in the introduction of Total Quality Management. With the completion of initial projects there was a significant `flattening out´ and, particularly on the shop floor, there was a perception that new ideas were lacking. During 1991 the view developed within the management team that `internal customers´ could give new direction to TQP (total quality performance). This was confirmed by an attitude survey that identified interdepartmental communications as an area for improvement. The internal customer initiative was launched in February 1992 with a quality objective highlighting the increasing demands and changing expectations of all customers. The internal customer concept has proven for BCHD a practical and effective route to quality improvement. The concept is not without potential problems, but these can be overcome to enable real benefits to be achieved

The objective of this research is to develop a case based reasoning system (CBRS) to assist medical students in diagnosis the histopathology. Case-based reasoning system will provide assistance to the medical students to retrieve the past successful diagnosis cases. This paper utilizes the CBR tool, myCBR, to construct a case-based reasoning system. myCBR is built upon the ontology tool: Prote&#769;ge&#769;. The cases are organized in an object-oriented way, which is inherited from Prote&#769;ge&#769;, for easy organization of the existing cases. Each class would have its attributes stored in the corresponding frame. Users can easily retrieve the most closed case by selecting the proper class from the menu then specified the corresponding values in the frame. A pilot implementation will show the process of the simulation case retrieval.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of soy protein isolate (SPI), three forms of native corn gluten meal on sensory, color and textural characteristics of an emulsified meat product. The meals included native corn gluten meal (CGM) that had been ph-adjusted from 4.4 to 6.6 and particle size reduced to either ∼38 (MC38) or ∼7 μm (MC7). When judged by a trained sensory panel, all CGM-based substances contributed the same degree of CGM off-odor intensity, but significantly lowered pork odor intensity when compared to SPI-containing products and controls. SPI and all CGM-based substances increased grain-like odor. Visual off-color was apparent in all meat products containing CGM-based substances. Instrumental color evaluation indicated that products containing CGM-based substances were lighter, more yellow colored than control and SPI-containing products. However, sensory denseness, springiness and cohesiveness, and texture profile analyses of meat products were not affected.

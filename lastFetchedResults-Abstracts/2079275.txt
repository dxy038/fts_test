The objective of this stud y was to evaluate the influence of wood fiber content (15, 30 and 45 percent) and
molecular structure of polymer on the physical and mechanical properties composites from linear Low Density
Polyethylene (LLDPE) and low density Polyethylene (LDPE). The polyethylene and saw dust were properly
mixed and injection molded. The results obtained show that the water absorption increased significantly, finally,
the thickness swelling increased with increasing wood fiber content. The mechanical properties tests were carried
out. There is decreasing tensile strength value and as the saw dust loading increased in the polymer matrix.
However the flexural strength increased as the weight fraction of the saw increased. Hence LLDPE are better than
LDPE for use with saw dust.

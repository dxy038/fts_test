We present a new computer interface that combines gaze tracking with brainwave measurements in an integrated head-mounted device. This interface is novel in the following four ways compared to previous works. First, because the system is designed as a single head-mounted device, both the brainwave data and eye images for gaze tracking can be acquired by wearing only one device that includes a sensing node and an eye image-capturing camera. Second, the noise in the brainwave data caused by blinking is removed by a blink detection system in the eye camera. Third, the sensitivity of a gaze-based navigation speed is appropriately controlled on the basis of the level of attention estimated by analyzing the brainwave. Fourth, performance and usability of the interface are validated by objective evaluating and subjective surveys. From experimental results, we confirmed that the proposed system shows promising performance and usability as a new computer interface<sup>1</sup>.

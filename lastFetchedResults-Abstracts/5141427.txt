In this paper, we illustrate the performance evaluation methods for optoelectronic circuit boards (OECBs). Here we report the details of the evaluation techniques for a bidirectional OECB developed to operate at 10 Gbps using a flip chip SMT optical transceiver. The evaluation techniques include DC and high speed optical characterization of individual component as well as at interconnect level. Performance evaluation of optical waveguide, optical DC characterization of VCSEL and photo diode, high speed optical characterization of transmitter, receiver and optical link are described here in detail.

Objective
Plasticity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) has gained major interest in stem cell research. In order to investigate whether HSC may differentiate into mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), we assessed chimerism in peripheral blood (PB), mononuclear cell fractions (MNC) of bone marrow, and MSC derived from bone marrow (BM) from 27 up to 4225 days after allogeneic transplantation.
Patients and methods

We applied fluorescence in situ hybridization using X/Y gene probes in sex-mismatched and STR-PCR in sex-matched patients. MSC could have been generated in 27 of 55 bone marrow samples derived from 20 patients. Fifteen patients received peripheral blood stem cell transplants (PBSCT), including CD34-selected PBSCT in two. Five patients received bone marrow.
Results

While all patients had chimerism in PB and MNC of the BM, in all but one patient BM-derived MSC were of recipient origin. This single patient showed reproducibly MSC of donor origin in a frequency of 1% after having received a CD34-selected PBSCT. Looking at graft collections, MSCs were easily generated from BM specimens, while no MSC could be derived from PBSC samples.
Conclusion

Even though HSC have been found to differentiate into a variety of nonhematological cell types, they usually do not differentiate into MSC after allogeneic transplantation.

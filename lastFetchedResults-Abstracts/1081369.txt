The solubility of carbon dioxide in different mixtures of aqueous solutions (normal water and different composition of saline water) has been determined at temperature of 25-90 °C and pressure of 1–2 bar by using an experimental rig which has been designed to ensure proper contact between the CO2 gas and different mixtures of aqueous solutions. The continuous analysis of the outlet vapour for CO2 content was done by the CM-5011 Carbon Coulometer and the amount of CO2 absorbed into the solution was calculated, this was followed by calculating Henry's law constant. The objective of this work is to present an experimental data that would show the effect of temperature, salinity and pressure on CO2 solubility in aqueous solutions.

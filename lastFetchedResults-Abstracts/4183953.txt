A 1.2 MW photovoltaic (PV) plant, with double concentration and two axis solar tracking, will be installed in Seville (Spain). It is based on V-trough concentration with the objective of reduced energy generation cost. Low concentration (=2X) is required because of efficiency and reliability of the used standard manufactured PV modules. This work analyses the geometry and optical efficiency of the V-trough concentrator, and the electrical behavior of standard PV cells and modules operating at low level concentration.

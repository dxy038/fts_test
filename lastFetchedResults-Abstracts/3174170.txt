Based on credibility theory, this paper firstly constructs a new type of fuzzy crop production planning expected value model with credibility constraints, in which the production profit and the man-power coefficients are uncertain and assumed to be characterized by fuzzy variables with known possibility distributions. Then we discuss some basic properties with respect to the objective function and credibility constraints. Regarding the proposed fuzzy crop production planning problem, we can rarely solve it directly using the classical optimization algorithms. But in some special cases, we can transform the objective function and the credibility constraints into the equivalent linear form via some theoretical methods. After that, we can solve this fuzzy crop production planning optimization problem by some classical algorithms. Finally, we consider a practical crop production planning example and solve it by Lingo software.

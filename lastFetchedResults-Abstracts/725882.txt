A series of N1-nicotinoyl-3- (4′-hydroxy-3′-methyl phenyl)-5-(substituted phenyl)-2-pyrazolines were synthesized by the reaction between isoniazid (INH) and chalcones and were tested for their antimycobacterial activity in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) and INH-resistant M. tuberculosis (INHR-MTB) using the agar dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds, compound (i) N1-nicotinyl-3-(4′-hydroxy-3′-methyl phenyl)-5-(1″-chlorophenyl)-2-pyrazoline was found to be the most active agent against MTB and INHR-MTB, with minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.26 μm. When compared to INH-compound i was found to be 2.8- and 43.7-fold more active against MTB and INHR-MTB, respectively.

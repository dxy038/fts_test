Objective: Root resorption is a complication of orthodontic treatment and till date, there is
a dearth of information regarding this issue. The aim of this study was to determine whether
the expression of transforming growth factor-B1 (TGF-B1, an inflammatory cytokine) is
related to orthodontic force. Moreover, if associated, the expression level may be helpful
in differential diagnosis, control and ultimate treatment of the disease.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, a total of 24 eight-week-old male
Wistar rats were selected randomly. On day 0, an orthodontic appliance, which consisted
of a closed coil spring, was ligated to the upper right first molar and incisor. The upper
left first molar in these animals was not placed under orthodontic force, thus serving as
the control group. On day 21, after anesthesia, the animals were sacrificed. The rats
were then divided into two equal groups where the first group was subjected to histological
evaluation and the second group to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). Orthodontic tooth movement was measured in both groups to determine the
influence of the applied force.
Results: Statistical analysis of data showed a significant root resorption between the experimental
group and control group (P < 0.05), however, there was no significant difference
in the expression level of the inflammatory cytokine, TGF-B1.
Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, we suggest that there is a direct relationship
between orthodontic force and orthodontic induced inflammatory root resorption. In
addition, no relationship is likely to exist between root resorption and TGF-B1 expression
in the resorptive lacunae.

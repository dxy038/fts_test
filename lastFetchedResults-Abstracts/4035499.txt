A multiplexer/demultiplexer based on a meander-type InP grating-assisted codirectional coupler is reported. It provides simultaneous bidirectional operation at two different wavelengths within the same 1.3 &#956;m window, as well as high bit rate distribution at 1.5 &#956;m. The same demultiplexer is usable in both optical terminals of a 1.3<sup>+</sup> or 1.3<sup>-</sup>/1.5 &#956;m access network

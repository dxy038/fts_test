The mobile user objective system (MUOS) is US NavyÂ´s next-generation military satellite communications network. MUOS communication links are designed to have good performance under harsh UHF channel conditions. A MUOS channel model has been developed for accurate link and system performance evaluation. This channel model is difficult to implement due to the complexity of UHF propagation effects, in this paper, a methodology for validating MUOS channel simulators is presented. To facilitate the validation process, several closed-form statistical functions of the model are derived.

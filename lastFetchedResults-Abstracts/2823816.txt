Summary form only given. Recently, design of light control pulse has attracted great attention both numerically and experimentally. The light pulse has interesting ability to change electron- or molecular-states to arbitrary objective states. We can obtain various photoreaction products with high quantum yield by using the light pulse. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies for numerical design of the pulse are based on the approximation which neglects the radiated field from particles. However, the approximation has not been verified yet because the complicated light-particle interaction must be accurately modeled in order to investigate the physical reliability. In this paper, firstly we analyze a single electron irradiated with the light control pulse which is designed by the conventional method based on the approximation to neglect the radiated field from the electron itself. The interaction is precisely simulated by the hybrid simulation of Maxwell´s and Schro&#776;dinger´s equations employing the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) scheme. It is represented that the conventional pulse cannot fully control the electron-state to the objective state due to the strong radiated field near the wave function. Secondly, we propose a novel method in which the light control pulse is designed with the effect of the radiated field from the electron using the Maxwell-Schro&#776;dinger hybrid algorithm. It is demonstrated that the new pulse can precisely control the electron-state.

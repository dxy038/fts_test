The optimum design of a low-noise amplifier is very important in order to detect a weak signal. The usual constraints are high sensitivity and wide operation range for a receiver. The objective of this paper is to find an effective and universal method for low-noise amplifier design. An illustrative example with the good experimental results is presented to expand on the modularized method. Also the method presented can be extended to the noise analysis and design of many other circuit topologies

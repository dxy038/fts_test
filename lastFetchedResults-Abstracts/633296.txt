Objective: Limited joint mobility (LJM) has been described as the earliest clinical complication of diabetes mellitus.
This study was performed to determine the frequency of limited joint mobility and to evaluate the association between LMJ and some chronic diabetic complications.
Materials and Methods: A total of 125 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 11.89 ±3.75 years, with 4.2±2 years mean duration of disease were studied. Diabetic patients were compared with 125 healthy young controls that were group-matched for age and sex. Variables such as age, sex, duration of disease and mean HbA1c level were obtained from the patients? medical records. LJM was assessed by observing the small joints of the hands in the prayer position. Student t-test and chi-square (X2) were used for comparisons between groups.
Results: The frequency of LJM was significantly higher in diabetic patients compared to healthy controls (19.2% vs. 4%, p=0.001). Diabetic patients with LJM had not longer duration of diabetes than those without LJM (4.33 years compared to 4.08 years, p=0.55). Its presence was significantly related to microalbuminuria (p=0.017) and higher systolic blood pressure (p=0.001).
Conclusion: Diabetic patients showed a significantly higher frequency of LJM than non-diabetic patients. LJM in the hands of patients with type 1 DM was associated with microalbuminuria but it was not related to retinopathy.

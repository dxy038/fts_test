Almost everyone has experienced fear at least once in their life because of a test. Fear can positively mobilise students, when it is under control. However, when fear becomes excessive, it can completely destroy students´ performance. Moreover, when dealing with a computerised test, fear can have an even more intense influence on students. The objective of this paper is to analyze about these issues and to propose an adaptive self-assessment system for reducing fear and supporting students´ learning during the preparation for exams.

In a pipelined-channel interconnection network, multiple bits may be simultaneously in flight on a single wire. This allows the cycle time of the network to be independent of the wire lengths, significantly affecting the network design trade-offs. This paper investigates the design and performance of pipelined channel k-ary n-cube networks, with particular emphasis on the choice of dimensionality and radix. Networks are investigated under the constant link width, constant node size and constant bisection constraints. We find that the optimal dimensionality of pipelined-channel networks is higher than that of nonpipelined-channel networks, with the difference being greater under looser wiring constraints. Their radix should remain roughly constant as network size is grown, decreasing slightly for some unidirectional tori and increasing slightly for some bidirectional meshes. Pipelined-channel networks are shown to provide lower latency and higher bandwidth than their nonpipelined-channel counterparts, especially for high-dimensional networks. The paper also investigates the effects of switching overhead and message lengths, indicating where results agree with and differ from previous results obtained for nonpipelined-channel networks

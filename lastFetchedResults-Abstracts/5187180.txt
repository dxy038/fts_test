The objective of this presentation is to address looping issue which may happen when the ten-digit Global Title Translation (GTT) data is transmitted by the LNP Administration Center when updating the GTT nodes, and propose a provisioning solution which will resolve the issue. This proposal enables service providers to provision GTT nodes from Administration Center and update all necessary nodes in LNP networks without logging into each node (office) which accommodates this GTT node. Further, this interface manages a sequential update technique which allows service providers to avoid the possibility of GTT message looping that happens when two GTT nodes are non-synchrony updated with GT translation information. In a case when intermediate network is present, this proposal eliminates mis-routing that happens due to non-sync GTT information across the networks

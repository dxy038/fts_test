Two new resource allocation schemes are proposed for foggy reconfigurable free space optical (FSO) networks. The schemes are formulated as multi-objective optimization problems (MOP). The MOP is composed of lexicographic lex-max-min and Lex-min-max optimization. One of these schemes enhances reliability and fairness over network capacity while the other scheme does the opposite. The simulation results reveal that two schemes have higher reliability and fairness over robust static topology (relay network).

Objective: The purpose of this study was designing a model of sport sponsorship selection in Iran’s premier league.
Methodology: The research method was descriptive and correlative. The statistical population consisted of sponsors who sponsored 9 sport teams in active premier leagues and 134 sponsors were selected as samples. Researcher– developed questionnaire with 24 questions was used to collect data. Its content and face validity was confirmed by 15 experts in sport management and sponsorship. Coronbachs Alpha coefficient was used to test the reliability of the questionnaire . Factor Analysis with a varimax rotation was used to analyse the data.
Results: Twenty-four variables were classified into four categories of sport nature, sponsor nature, management interests and compatibility degree. Finally, doing a Path analysis, the model of sport sponsorship selection of Iran was developed. Exploratory model indicated that sponsor nature and sport nature factors were independent ones and compatibility degree was as a intermediary factor, with the management interests acting as a response and dependent factor. Among all variables, sport nature has the highest effect on management interests (0.52).
Conclution: It is suggested that for increasing sport sponsorship in order to enhance satisfaction of sponsors, the effective and independant factors should be reinforced.

The objective of this work is to investigate the fatigue behavior of a single crystal nickel-based superalloy in the gigacycle regime. Testing from 106 to 109 cycles at 593 °C was performed using an ultrasonic fatigue system operating at 20 kHz. Multiple tests were performed at stresses near the fatigue limit to determine the variability in fatigue life in this regime. Endurance limit results were compared to similar data generated on conventional servohydraulic test systems to determine if there are any frequency effects. Scanning electron microscopy was then used to determine the initiation sites and the failure mechanisms. Initial results indicate little or no frequency effect on the fatigue strength or failure mechanisms of PWA 1484 at 593 °C.

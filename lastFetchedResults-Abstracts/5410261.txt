Deterministic timed event graphs (TEGs) are used in this paper to model manufacturing systems. The steady-state performance evaluation of such systems is carried out on the basis of simple results referred to TEGs. In this framework, a two-objective optimization problem joining the maximization of the system productivity and the minimization of the work-in-progress is formalized. The solution of this problem is sought by decomposing the overall problem in simpler subproblems whose structure turns out to be that of linear programming problems or linear mixed integer programming problems

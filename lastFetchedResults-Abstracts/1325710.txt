In the era of information and communication technology with all available new technologies in the field of education, students are subject to more challenges and risks comparing to the previous generations and they do need to learn new fields of knowledge and must have more comprehensive skills than before. The main objective of this study was to study the impact of educational software in improving the basic learning skills of students in the arts curriculum. The study has been conducted on fifth-graders of elementary schools in Amol (2011). In this quasi-experimental research, the sample classes were randomly selected out of approximately 150 classes of fifth grade elementary school students.  The samples consisting of two classes with almost 50 students, were divided into two groups: experiment and control. The data collection instrument was a questionnaire for pre-test and post-test data. To analyze the results of pre-test and post-test scores, the descriptive statistics including mean and standard deviation and also the inferential statistics (t test) was used for independent groups. By comparing the pre-test scores of two groups, it was observed that the two groups had no significant difference in the skills. Whereas comparing the scores of post test, it was observed that the performance of groups was significantly different when using the educational software i.e. the use of educational software can improve the basic skills of students for arts curriculum at fifth grade elementary school level.

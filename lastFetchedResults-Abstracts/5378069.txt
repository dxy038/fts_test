To achieve food safety, risk control in food supply chain is required. Supplier evaluation and selection is one important process for food supply chain. This paper establishes a system based on risk control and integrates the DEA-based objective method and the ANP-based subjective method into a new ANP&amp;DEA-based decision model for supplier evaluation. The paper explains the mathematical analysis in the specific case of a deteriorating food supply chain to confirm the model.

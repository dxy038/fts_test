Background: Maximal Volume Oxygen is an accepted standard for measuring cardiorespiratory readiness. This factor indicates the power of physiological adoption for increasing activity time and efficiency of cardiovascular system. The objective of this study was to find out an optimal correlation between Maximal Volume Oxygen and Maximal Voluntary Ventilation indicators and their effect on cardiorespiratory readiness of Shahid Chamran athlete students during 2004-2005.

Methods: A descriptive analytical study was designed to recruit athlete students. Sixthy athlete students were selected using simple random selection method. The subjects age range was between 19-25 years old and they were about the same weight and height. Data was analyzed using canonical correlation analysis methods.

Results: The results indicated that the optimal correlation occurs when both lung expiration and lung inspiration indicators have simultaneous effect of Maximal Volume Oxygen and Maximal Voluntary Ventilation on spirometric ones( r=0.81 , p<0.001). This correlation indicated 65.61 percent change of spirometric indicators by lung inspiration and expiration indicators.

Conclusion: The study concluded that there is a positive and direct relationship between lung inspiration and expiration indicators and spirometric ones.

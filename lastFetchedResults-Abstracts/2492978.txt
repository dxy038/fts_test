There are several different factors in industrial processes, which may have an impact on final product specifications. In this paper, the nonlinear multi-objective mathematical modeling for the 5 qualitative characteristics of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as one of the most widely used products in petrochemical industry is done by 9 Key parameters affecting the production process. For this purpose, Response Surface Methodology that is the combination of experiments design and statistical tests is applied along with Artificial Neural Network and Metaheuristic algorithms

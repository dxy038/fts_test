The development of educational Web pages has become one of the main tools used by institutions and teachers in engineering courses. However, these pages are usually constructed following teacherÂ´s criteria, instead of finding out the true usefulness for students. The main objective of this work is to analyze the usability of several educational Web pages devoted to digital electronics in Spanish engineering universities. The final goal is to get a list of conclusions that can help teachers to construct their own educational Web pages. The planning of the work for this purpose comprises three global stages. The first one constitutes the present paper. Authors introduce the need of the study, survey the current representation of usability concept and choose a model for the evaluation of software usability. The remaining two phases are also explained. Even though the study has been focused on the field of digital electronics, the final conclusions can be applied to other topics

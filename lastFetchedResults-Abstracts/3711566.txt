The question of a suitable control-relevant identification strategy for a class of long-range predictive controllers is addressed. It is shown that under certain conditions the best process model for predictive control is that which is estimated using an identification objective function that is a dual of the control objective function. The resulting nonlinear least squares calculation is asymptotically equal to a standard recursive least squares with an appropriate (model and controller-dependent) FIR data prefilter. Experimental results demonstrate the validity and practicality of the proposed estimation law

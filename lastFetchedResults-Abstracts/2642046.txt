There are two types of poverty in general: relative and absolute. Economically poverty is the lack of financial and monetary capacity, socially it is the lack of awareness and social exclusion, politically it is the lack of political participation and psychologically it is isolation, mistrust and suspicion. Culture of poverty is the culturazation of poverty among the poor that its main characteristics are continuous, generational perpetuation of poverty, lack of motivation to break the vicious circle of poverty, social mistrust, reluctance to civic participation, fatalism and acceptance of socio-economic failures. Accordingly, the main objective of this research was to determine the sociological culture of poverty among the rural poor.
The method used in this study is quantitative-survey. And the tool of data collection is questionnaire. A sample of 267 people were selected using Cochrane systematic and stratified sampling. 
The results showed that social partnership (-0/345), dependence on others (0/212), social capital (-0/353), social status (-0/387), domestic violence (-0/218), social isolation (0/134) and socio-economic base hereditary (-0/319) had significant correlation with poverty but unemployment and authoritarian personality variable had no significant relationship with the culture of poverty. In multiple regression analysis, the coefficient of determination is (0/491), adjusted coefficient of determination is (0/478) and multiple correlation coefficients is (0/345) and independent variables alone could explain 49/0 % of changes in dependent variable.

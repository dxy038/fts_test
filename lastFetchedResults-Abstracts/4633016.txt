Summary form only given, as follows. The peniotron has demonstrated an electronic conversion efficiency as high as 75 %, making the device attractive as a source of high frequency RF power, especially in harmonic operation. However, practical realization of the device is dependant on 1) selection of a stable operating mode, free of competition from gyrotron modes, 2) a high quality axis-encircling beam to increase the interaction efficiency, and 3) extraction of sufficient power to provide high device efficiency. This is the objective of the UCD peniotron.

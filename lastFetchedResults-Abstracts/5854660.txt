The multilateral CONSIS project is related to the migration towards Network Enabled Capabilities (NEC) in the participating countries. As such, CoNSIS aligns with the overarching objective of the NATO NEC (NNEC) to enhance the AllianceÂ´s ability to federate various capabilities at all levels, military (strategic to tactical) and civilian through networking and information infrastructure. Providing security and efficient network management have been important aspects of this work. The work has been a combination of theoretical studies and field experiments in order to get hands-on experience with the involved technologies. This possibility of addressing radios, networks, SOA, security and management together, has given us knowledge on how the different technologies affect each other and how they may be combined. A follow up project (CoNSIS phase II) is being planned with startup in 2014.

This paper discuss the novel implementation of Learner Centered Design Approach of E-learning System using 3D Virtual Tutors [1] and further enhances this work in facilitating young learners to interact with human tutors using WebRTC Based Multimedia Chat system. The present work adds three main features such as: Firstly, addition of live video lecture session by which students can interact with the tutor just like video call of Skype system. Secondly, the presentation of 3D virtual tutors´ narrations of articles in the text form of live transcriptions of avatars´ speech. Thirdly, introduction of timed quiz by which a real-life objective examination can be mimicked and thereby evaluating the performance of students. Lastly, we present a comparative evaluation of the original system and its improved version with respect to responses received from a large pool of young learners using the system.

In the article balance platform model will be presented, which in further part serve for leading simulation testing series. Because this type of mechanisms are mostly used in the posturoghaphy examinations, which rely on compensation movements registering performed in the straight posture so in the article authors concentrate on system consisting movable plate which moves in two directions x and y. Proposed system has also possibility of movement division in axis x for separate movement of each limb. In order to simulation tests performance mathematical model described by below equations was developed. At basis of motion equations simulation model was developed, which serves for leading of system tests. Experiments were divided for two parts: static and dynamic tests. They allow for determining of maximum forces needed to actuate mechanism as well as for its braking. Thanks to it in further examinations possible will be objective estimation of examined patient balance state. In further part of tests model will be widen by rehabilitated patient model with taking into account mass change. Also will be proposed control algorithm, which allows for controller adaptation to various mass of patients.

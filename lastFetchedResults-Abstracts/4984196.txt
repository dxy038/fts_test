Recently, a minimum classification error training algorithm has been proposed for minimizing the misclassification probability based on a given set of training samples using a generalized probabilistic descent method. This algorithm is a type of discriminative learning algorithm, but it approaches the objective of minimum classification error in a more direct manner than the conventional discriminative training algorithms. We apply this algorithm for simultaneous design of feature extractor and pattern classifier, and demonstrate some of its properties and advantages

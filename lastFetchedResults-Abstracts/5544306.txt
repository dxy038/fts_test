A Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation of NAS-wide beacon code assignment in the CONUS is presented. The optimization model is also tested with historical data and results demonstrated for a limited scenario. The objective of this research is to minimize (and if-possible eliminate) the need for change in the flight beacon codes as they cross center boundaries en-route to their destination. This reduction in the need to change beacon codes can help alleviate the additional burden during the workload intensive hand-off procedures.

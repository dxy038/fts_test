The inductive characteristics of graphite thin slabs are investigated with the objective of designing convenient loads for domestic induction heating uses. For this purposes it is defined a figure of merit consisting of the increment of the resistance of a loaded planar coil with respect to the resistance of the coil in the air. The equivalent resistance of the coupled coil-slab system is obtained by means of analytical calculations which are compared to resistance measurements. Performance of graphite slabs of different thicknesses and a ferromagnetic conventional material are compared.

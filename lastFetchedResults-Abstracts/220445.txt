ObJective(s): To plan an educational program to prevent HIV IAIDS among university students based on
Health Belief Model (HBM).
Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Tehran University in academic year of
2004-2005. The instrument used was a questionnaire including demographic information, knowledge
questions, health belief model constructs (perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits and
barriers) and attitude towards HIV IAIDS patients, high risk behaviors questionnaire and intention to take
HIV test. The participants were selected through stratified and systematic methods. Data were analyzed
performing Chi- square test, Pearson correlation and one way ANOVA.
Results: In all 664 students participanted in the study. The mean age was l8.47Â±8/1. According to self
r~pOI1, ~/o 4.1 were smoker, ~/o2.9 used substance drugs, % 1.5 suffered from sexual transmitted disease and
%58.\ intended to take HIV test. TV, news paper and magazines were the main sources of information about
HIViAIDS. %26.4 believed that their knowledge is insufficient. %71.1 believed in having low risk of being
infected. Almost all of the participants were highly aware of HIV IATDS. The results also indicated that there
was a significant relationship between the participants' knowledge and their perceived severity and
susceptibility and benefits in term of willing to take the test. Lack of HIV voluntary counseling and testing
center and fear of the test results were the main barriers of HIV test.
Conclusion: Thc findings suggest that we need to educate and raise the people consciousness about the
perceived benefits of HfV test, the way of giving the lest results. and the contact details and services for
voluntary counseling and testing centers.

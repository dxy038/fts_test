In the process of bidding for construction project, the winning bid is often determined by experts who assess bids in their marks, which have a strong subjective element. So there is the possibility to control who will be the winning bidder. This paper introduces the multi-layer feed forward back propagation (BP) neural network which belong to the artificial neural network (ANN) system to design a three-layer BP neural network system, which can automatic assess bids by computer. BP neural network with parallel processing, nonlinear approximating, good robust and adaptability can ensure bids evaluation activities fair and objective. Finally, the article uses a great deal of data for test and evaluation simulation to verify this system reliability and validity.

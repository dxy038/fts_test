Composition of fuell cell, battery and ultra capacitor in a hybrid electric vehicle, has the advantages of high-power density, fast startup, and good dynamic response. Obviously, the performance of the drive train relies mainly on control quality. This work presents an enhanced method for distributing power demand through the hybrid power sources. Fuzzy logic control has considered for this purpose. Moreover, genetic algorithm has been  implemented for tuning this strategy by off-line simulation in two combined driving cycle and evaluation in four separated driving cycles. Multiple objective fitness function deals with effective parameters (such as equivalent consumption, fuel cell and energy storage efficiency, state of charge variation, dynamic response) for getting reliable results from the optimization process. Finally, the optimized strategy presents a fully-advanced method for energy management system of fuel cell hybrid vehicles

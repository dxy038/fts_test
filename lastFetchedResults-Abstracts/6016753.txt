In this paper, we focus on firm real-time optimistic concurrency control algorithms that schedule the data accesses objective transactions in order to meet their deadlines, especially in replicated databases. The proposed optimistic concurrency control algorithms incorporate either non-blocking or blocking mechanisms in the validation stage. Our experiments demonstrate that the blocking-based algorithm is superior to non-blocking-based algorithm

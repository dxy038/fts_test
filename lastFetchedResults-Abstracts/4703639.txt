We have shown that a 15 GB optical disc that has a transparent plastic substrate of 0.3 mm thickness can be reproducible with an objective lens of NA 0.65, without any tilt servo and crosstalk cancel. And we also confirmed that the injection pressing molding method may be feasible to produce a plastic substrate of 0.3 mm thickness.

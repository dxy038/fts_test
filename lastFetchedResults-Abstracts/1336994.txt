The objective of this study was to determine the effect of vitamin E source on plasma vitamin E concentration. Five different formulations of natural source vitamin E (4,000 IU/day) were supplemented to Standardbred mares (n = 4 per group) for 14 days. Treatment 1 was given 10 g of 400 IU/g natural acetate (RRR-α-tocopheryl-acetate) powder, treatment 2 was given 6.66 g of 600 IU/g natural acetate powder, treatment 3 was given 6.66 g of 600 IU/g natural alcohol (RRR-α-tocopherol) powder, treatment 4 was given 20 g of 200 IU/g micellized natural alcohol powder, and treatment 5 was given 8 mL of 500 IU/mL micellized natural alcohol liquid. Blood samples were collected before supplementation (day 0), after day 7 and day 14 of supplementation, and analyzed for plasma α-tocopherol. Treatments 1, 2, and 3 increased (P < .05) from days 0 to 7, but remained similar at day 14. Treatments 4 and 5 also increased (P = .004, and P < .0001, respectively) from days 0 to 7 and were higher (P < .05) than treatment 1, 2, and 3. Plasma levels peaked at day 7 and either plateaued or decreased (treatment 5, P = .004) at day 14. The micellized alcohol formulations remained elevated (treatment 4) or decreased (treatment 5) after achieving peak blood concentration and, as hypothesized, tended to have plasma concentrations higher than the other vitamin E forms. Care should be taken to ensure that the most active biologically available form of vitamin E is provided in the diet to maximize its efficiency.

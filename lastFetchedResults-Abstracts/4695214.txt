Equipment is the active part in fixed investments of the construction project. In manufacturing engineering construction where Organic formation of capital is high, the equipment price accounts for a ratios of the construction costs. However, it takes a long process to complete the contract of large-scale equipment introducing and there also exists many uncertainty factors, which lead to the obvious difference between the value and price of the equipment while settling ultimately. This paper employed the principle of time value of money, established a equivalent settlement model and further built a model in large-scale equipment´s value occupying realization. By calculating analysis to prove that the time value of money is an objective existence that it become a basic principle in investment, namely, take full advantage of the time value of money, maximize access to the equipment´s value and cut down the cost disbursement, so as to control the construction costs effectively.

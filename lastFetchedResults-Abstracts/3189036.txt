This paper deals with the currently developing video encoding standard H.265/HEVC. The scope of this paper is to evaluate the encoding and compression efficiency of the new standard in comparison to its predecessor H.264/AVC and more specifically to validate if the main objective of the new codec is satisfied, which is to double the compression efficiency of the bit stream without deteriorating the quality level of the encoded signal.

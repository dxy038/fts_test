Power systems are step by step increasing its complexity in order to fulfill the requirements of current energy scenario. An interesting option is to use power systems formed by the connection of multiple power converters working to achieve a common objective. This is the case of multilevel converters with high number of power cells, current interleaved converters or parallel connection of power converters. This fact leads to solve the challenges of an efficient data communication structure what becomes critical when the number of power modules is high. This paper presents a solution of this challenge highlighting its simplicity and high performance. As an example, the proposed communications scheme has been experimentally implemented in a multilevel cascaded h-bridge converter demonstrating its good performance.

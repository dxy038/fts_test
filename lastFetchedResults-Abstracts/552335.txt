Background and Objective: Recent studies have shown that lead causes oxidative stress in bones by inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species. In this study, the effects of 8-week curcumin supplementation on the regional bone mineral density of femur and tibial bones in rats exposed to lead acetate was investigated. Materials and Method: Fifty days aged Wistar rats were randomly assigned to baseline, sham-operate, lead acetate and curcumin + lead (curcumin) groups. Lead and/or curcumin groups received 20 mg/kg lead acetate peritoneally for 8 weeks (3 days/week). In addition, the curcumin group received 30 mg/kg curcumin solution for 3 days-a-week for 8 weeks. The femur and tibial BMD were measured by Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) methods. Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA test and SPSS 17.

Results: MDA and lead levels were significantly lower in the curcumin group compared with lead-exposed and baseline groups. In addition, BMD and TAC levels was significantly higher in the curcumin group compared with lead-treated and baseline groups.

Conclusion: These results show that environmental exposure to lead may be a risk factor for skeletal diseases. Furthermore, the curcumin supplementation possibly has inhibitory effects on lead-induced loss of femur and tibial BMD. Sci Med J 2011; 10(3):295-307

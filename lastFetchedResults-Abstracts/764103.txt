Due to the development of various types of sciences, in particular, the information technology, expansion of telecommunication and communication networks and the soaring influence of personal computers among people, the effectiveness of traditional ways of working is diminishing. Despite this fact, the most important factor to institutionalize teleworking is its acceptance by the users. Accordingly, the basic question this study raises is weather the attitude of the employees towards teleworking is effective on their acceptance or not. This study concerns applied objective and it is of correlational-descriptive type in which data was collected and analyzed through 110 questionnaires, investigating the impact of individuals' attitude towards teleworking on its accepting by the employees of the Ministry of Industry, Mining and Trade. Based on the research model, the effective factors on accepting teleworking were categorized into three individual, organizational and social levels and then examined within the framework of advantages and disadvantages. The results suggest that there is a positive and significant relationship between the attitude of employees towards teleworking and its acceptance.

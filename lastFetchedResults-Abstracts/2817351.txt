In order to understand diseases regarding the musculoskeletal system, it is necessary to be familiar with the basic laws of the physiology of movement and individual morphological structures that create this movement. The presented article deals with the methodology of scanning and processing electrical processes in a muscle. In order to determine pathological state, expert knowledge is needed and due to this fact, the objective of this study was determination of behaviour of muscle groups of the upper extremity before and after load application in healthy population. The electromyographic system serves this purpose and it enables to scan the electrical muscle changes. The device BTS FREEEMG 300 was used for measuring, using a principle of surface electromyography. Obtained signal was then processed in the Matlab programme and the acquired values were evaluated by using a significance test of two variables.

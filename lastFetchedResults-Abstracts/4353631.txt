Efficiency of a video transmission over different networks is dependant on many coding and network parameters. Moreover, it is important to take into account the video content complexity when the video transmission over the network with limited capacity is required. In this paper we used the MPEG-4 codec and Network Simulator 2 (NS-2) to examine the impact of video content complexity on the overall quality of coded and over the IP and WLAN networks transmitted video. As a measure of objective video quality the Multi-scale Structural SIMilarity (MS-SSIM) index is used. Simulation results state that in terms of considered metric the video content complexity plays a significant role in a video transmission over the network of limited bandwidth.

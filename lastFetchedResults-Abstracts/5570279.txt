This paper addresses the problem of musical noise introduced by conventional spectral subtraction method for speech enhancement. A modified spectral subtraction algorithm based on the masking properties of human auditory system is proposed. In comparison with ViragÂ´s algorithm, the modification of proposed method is made from four aspects. Firstly, VAD (Voice Activity Detection) is substituted by MCRA (Minima-Controlled Recursive Averaging) algorithm to estimate the background noise; Secondly, the masking threshold is calculated based on enhanced speech by multi-band spectral subtraction method; Thirdly, the adaptive parameters of spectral subtraction method is adjusted; Finally, a modified form of parametric spectral subtraction is employed. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated under ITU-T G.160 standard. The results shows that, comparing with the reference algorithms, the proposed method provides acceptable amount of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement and noise reduction with a little impact on the level of speech. The objective speech quality is improved evidently at the same time.

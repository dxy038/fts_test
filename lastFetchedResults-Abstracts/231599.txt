The objective of the study was to evaluate the development potential of advanced power production systems based on biomass pyrolysis and gasification. Several alternative process configurations and power plant types (diesel, gas turbine, combined cycle) were compared to conventional steam cycle power plants. Electricity production capacities between 5 to 60 MWe were included. It was shown that although presently more expensive than conventional alternatives, all the new options have potential for further development. The biomass to power projects are most likely at sites, where low cost side products are available in countries, which have a favourable electricity tariff or subsidies for renewables. These projects are often small scale. Under these extreme circumstances capital intensive, high efficiency thermal biomass power technologies have difficulties in competing with conventional technology with lower investment cost and lower efficiency. However, environmental taxes and increasing fuel costs will improve the competitiveness of new biomass fuelled power plant concepts.

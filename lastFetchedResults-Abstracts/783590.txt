Objective In recent years, there has been
a call for greater awareness of the relationship between
trauma and psychosis, and several studies
involving patients with psychotic disorders have
found a link between traumatic life experience and the
development of psychosis. However, little research
has examined psychotic experiences in a traumatised
population. Method This study investigated psychotic
experiences in a sample of 40 survivors of sexual assault
(SA) compared to a control group without a
history of sexual assault (measured using a self-report
questionnaire) and examined the psychological factors
that may contribute to the development of psychotic
experiences in sexually traumatised
individuals. In particular, the role of dissociation and
cognitive factors such as post-traumatic cognitions
were explored. Results Of the 26 sexually assaulted
participants that were interviewed, 46% reported
auditory hallucinations and 46% reported visual hallucinations.
A significantly higher rate of psychotic
phenomena (delusional ideation and predisposition
to hallucinations) was found in the sexually assaulted
group compared to the control group. Severity of SA
trauma was significantly associated with severity of
PTSD and psychotic symptomatology. Dissociation
was strongly associated with all measures of psychotic
phenomena and negative cognitions about the self
and the world were associated with predisposition to
hallucinations and delusional ideation. Regression
analyses revealed that after controlling for the severity
of SA trauma, dissociation and negative beliefs about
the self significantly predicted delusional distress, and
dissociation significantly predicted predisposition to
visual hallucinations. Conclusions These exploratory
findings support the idea that psychotic phenomena
may be caused by traumatic life experiences and
highlight the need for further research. The implications
of these results for research and clinical practice
are discussed.

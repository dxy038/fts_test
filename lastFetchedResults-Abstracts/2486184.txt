Waste cooking oil (WCO) is being generated large scale all over the world; hence it
has devised serious problems of its waste management. Organised collection of WCO
in voluminous quantity is mainly used for the production of biodiesel. Most
researchers focus primarily on the biodiesel generation from WCO, although other
applications are also important and require attention. Objective of this review article
is to highlight most of the aforementioned possible applications of WCO which may
help in its utilization apart from biodiesel. It can be processed to obtain pyrolytic oil,
hydrogen gas, biodiesel or electricity production by direct burning. Applications like
combined heat and power generation (CHP) can utilize WCO with utmost efficiently.
It can also be processed chemically to obtained biodegradable polyurethane sheets,
greases, biolubricants, soaps and alkyd resins. Properly purified and sterilized WCO
can be used as a carbon source in fermentation processes for the production of
rhamnolipid biosurfactant and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Waste cooking oil
therefore can be considered as a potential waste which can be utilized as energy
source and raw material for chemical or biological processes.

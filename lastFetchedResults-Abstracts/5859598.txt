The objective of this project is to expand the capabilities of the Mars Umbilical Technology Demonstrator (MUTD) at NASA Kennedy Space Center. The MUTD shall provide electrical power and fiber optic data cable connections between two simulated mars vehicles, about 1000 m apart. The wheeled mobile robot Omnibot is used to provide the mobile base for the system. The mate-to umbilical plate is mounted on a Cartesian robot, which is installed on the Omnibot mobile base. It is desirable to provide the operator controlling the Omnibot, the distance and direction to the target. An approach for finding the position and orientation of the mobile robot for navigation using inertial sensors and beacons is investigated

In this paper, an investigation of optimal cutting parameters for maximizing production rate or minimizing production cost in multistage turning operations is reported. A machining model is constructed based on a polynomial network. The polynomial network can learn the relationships between cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut) and cutting performance (surface roughness, cutting force, and tool life) through a self-organizing adaptive modeling technique. Once the geometric model for machined parts and various time and cost components of the turning operation are given, an optimization algorithm using a sequential quadratic programming method is then applied to the polynomial network for determining optimal cutting parameters. The optimal cutting parameters are subjected to an objective function of maximum production rate or minimum production cost with the constraints of a permissible limit of surface roughness and cutting force and a feasible range of cutting parameters.

ABSTRACT: Aloe barbadensis Miller, commonly known as Aloe Vera is extensively used as a base element in preparation of medicine, cosmetics and food supplements. The objective of this study was to find out the effect of different levels of nitrogen on morphological and physiological characteristic of Aloe vera plants. Treatments included four levels of nitrogen (0, 500, 1000 and 1500 mg pot-1). After 12 months growing morphological and physiological treats such as plant height, leaf number, leaf length, leaf diameter, leaf wide , leaf weight, gel fresh weight, fresh weight of leaf peel, gel to peel ratio were measured. The results showed that the application of nitrogen increased the growth factors such as leaf number, leaf thickness, offset numbers and leaf.  The highest levels of aloin concentration and chlorophyll content were obtained in N1500 mg. Increasing N supply positively on increasing aloe vera yield, growth and aloin concentration.

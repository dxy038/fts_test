The main objective of presenting this paper is to enlighten the importance of restructuring of an existing Low Voltage Distribution System (LVDS) into High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) which has a better voltage and loss profile and high quality of supply. In India, the average transmission and distribution losses have been officially indicated as 25% of the electricity generated, because of the fact of usage of long lengths of Low Voltage (LV) distribution lines. In HVDS these long length LV lines are replaced by High Voltage (HV) lines up to the Distribution Transformer (DTR) and then a small length LV line is extended to the consumers end. Due to the usage of long lengths of HV lines, there is no scope for unauthorized power pilferage unlike in LVDS. A large rated distribution transformer in LVDS is replaced by many number of small rated distribution transformers in HVDS. Adequate investment in efficient working of transmission and distribution systems in developing economies with high growth of electricity demand is an important objective. Hence to overcome all these problems, implementation of HVDS is considered as the best move to enhance the performance of a distribution system.

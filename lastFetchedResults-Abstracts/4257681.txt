Plasmas have been used to reduce flue gases. Research has shown that positive and negative coronas using pulsed voltages have an effect on removing SO/sub 2/, NO, and NO/sub 2/. In this paper bidirectional pulsed voltages are used to increase the efficiency of flue-gas reactors. The particle-mesh model using NGP (nearest-grid-point) and FEM (finite element method) calculate the detailed space-time variations of the electric fields for the streamer and it makes the characteristics of reactor clearer. In this simulation NO is considered a dominant gas.

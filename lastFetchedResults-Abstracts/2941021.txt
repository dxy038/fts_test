We present an adaptive compression and resampling technique using wavelet packet shrinkage. The motivating application is surface digitization for computer-aided manufacturing. The objective is to improve estimation accuracy using a sparse and irregular, but more accurate, resampling of the data. We provide modified thresholds for wavepacket shrinkage, heuristics for choosing the resampling grid, and a mean estimator using measured data. Computed results illustrate application of the proposed technique

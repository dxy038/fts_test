LANDMARC algorithm achieves satisfactory location accuracy with less reader by introducing active reference tags, usually placed in the form of regular grid and served as neighbors for the tracking tags. However, the uniform arrangement of the reference tags is not applicable in the case that the probability occurrence of each area differs greatly, or obstacles like wall and partition exist. The paper firstly establishes the objective function according to an event-based occurrence probability model, and then proposes a PSO-based optimizing mechanism. Comparing with an earlier solution and the uniform arrangement, we come to the conclusion that the proposed algorithm provides a better design with higher accuracy and stability.

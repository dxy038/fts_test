Improved performance of inverters may be obtained by increasing the switching frequency of the power semiconductor devices. Switching frequencies greater than the hard-switched limits may be obtained by using soft-switching techniques, The MOS-controlled thyristor (MCT) is a relatively new device showing a great potential in soft-switching applications involving high-power densities. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to extend the research work done on both soft-switched (resonant) inverters and MCTs by evaluating the operating characteristics of MCTs for switching frequencies up to approximately 75 kHz under a zero-voltage switching condition. A PCB is developed to subject the MCTs and passive components to stresses similar to those actually occurring in the resonant and actively-clamped resonant DC link inverter topologies. In addition, operation results of the operation of the MCT-based active clamp in the actively-clamp resonant DC link inverter and some practical implementation considerations are included

This study presents the use of genetic algorithm methodology for identification of a micro-organism mixture batch fermentation process. This process is described by complex and nonlinear differential equations according the mass balance. The parameters of the model are estimated using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Simulations of the model obtained show accuracy in prediction behaviour ofthe model.

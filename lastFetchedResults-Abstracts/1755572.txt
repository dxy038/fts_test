Objective
aper aims to evaluate the factorial validity of the Chinese version of the Chalder Fatigue Scale (ChCFS) using a Chinese community sample.
s
l of 201 Chinese adults completed the ChCFS, the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF12), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the fit of a one-factor model, a two-factor correlated model, and a three-factor hierarchical model in both the 14-item and 11-item versions of ChCFS to the current data.
s
successfully replicated the original two-factor structure in the current Chinese community sample, and the 11-item version demonstrated better data-model fit than the 14-item version. The instrument possessed good internal consistency (Cronbach's Î±=.863). The convergent validity with HADS and divergent validity with SF12 were also evident.
sions
is valid and reliable among Chinese adults in the general population.

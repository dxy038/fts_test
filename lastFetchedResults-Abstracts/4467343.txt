In this paper, the lattice structure of a class of filter banks that possesses both the linear-phase property and the mirror-image symmetry, referred to as MIS-LPPRFB, has been investigated. By combining the MIS and the LP constraints and proposing a new simplified scheme, a reduced lattice structure with fewer parameters has been developed. It is shown that the introduction of the MIS has imposed certain constraints on the invertible matrices in the lattice structure of the conventional LPPRFBs, reducing the number of free parameters by nearly one-half Using the new lattice structure, the optimization design problem of MIS-LPPRFBs is also addressed with an objective of achieving a high performance filter bank for its use in image compression coding.

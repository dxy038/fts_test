This paper presents an experimental study on the tuning of an industrial fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for a shell-and-tube heat exchanger system. The objective of the experiment is to study the effect of FLCÂ´s scaling factors (e, &#916;e &#916;u) to temperature controllability of the heat-exchanger system. Various values for e, &#916;e and &#916;u were set to FLC, and the process response (temperature) was observed. The result showed that a smaller value of e resulted in process instability, while a larger value would led to slower process response. Contrary to e, a smaller value of &#916;e resulted in slower process response, while a larger value would led to process instability. For &#916;u, a smaller value resulted in slower process response, while a larger value led to process instability.

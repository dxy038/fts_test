This paper presents the design consideration and performance analysis of an on-line, low-cost, high performance, and single-phase uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system based on a boost integrated flyback rectifier/energy storage dc/dc (BIFRED) converter. The system consists of an isolated ac/dc BIFRED converter, a bidirectional dc/dc converter, and a dc/ac inverter. It provides input power factor correction, electric isolation of the input from the output, low battery voltage, and control simplicity. Unlike conventional UPS topologies, the electrical isolation is provided using a high frequency transformer that results in a smaller size and lower cost. Detailed circuit operation, analysis, as well as simulation and experiment results are presented. A novel digital control technique is also presented for UPS inverter control. This controller follows the reference current and voltage of the inverter with a delay of two and four sampling periods, respectively.

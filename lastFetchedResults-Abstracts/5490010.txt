An expert system technique has been developed for improved power system contingency identification and classification and for immediate corrective measures. The application of the expert system to contingency selection aids in easily partitioning the contingencies so that only harmful cases, which are also further classified, are considered, thereby reducing the computational burden. The expert system aids in the selection of an appropriate performance index and in the choice of weights applicable to the performance index selected. The selected violations are included in the multiple objective optimal power flow program using a generalized quadratic-based model. An appropriate objective function for a given contingency is selected by the aid of the expert system. The expert system is developed using if-then rules derived from the experience of planning engineers and system operators during power system security analysis and corrective activities. The developed algorithm has been tested using several objective functions on actual power systems, and optimal solutions have been reached in relatively few iterations. The algorithm has successively classified and ranked contingencies while preventing masking and misranking phenomena

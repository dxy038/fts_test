Objective
To look at the national coverage, composition and discussion of breast cancer multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) in England.
Design and data source

All breast units in England both symptomatic and screening were sent a questionnaire.
Main outcome measures

Attendance of core members at MDT meetings; Percentage of patients discussed with a treatment plan; Private patients discussed; Reconstructive surgery.
Results

The majority of core members of the breast MDT attend weekly meetings to discuss the multidisciplinary management of patients with breast cancer, although attendance by medical oncologists and reconstructive breast surgeons is limited. Three MDTs never had a radiologist present and 3 never had a pathologist present at the MDT meeting. Most breast MDTs have a meeting coordinator to collect case-notes, radiographs and pathology reports to facilitate the meeting.

Seventy-nine out of 134 teams discuss every cancer patient and 118 also discuss private patients.

Twenty-seven teams record the outcome of the MDT meeting electronically, 32 teams book surgery, 16 radiotherapy and 15 book chemotherapy direct from the MDT meeting.

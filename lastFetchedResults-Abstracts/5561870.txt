This paper proposes a novel multi-channel medium access control (MAC) that is based on CSMA/CA mechanism. The objective of this research is to evaluate the possibility of increasing network capacity and addressing collision problem of wireless sensor network comprising of low spec physical hardware. The proposed protocol can be implemented into wireless sensor network platform i.e. MICAz, Tmote-Sky without any additional hardware or firmware. Experiment results show that the proposed protocol can effectively improve the network performance compared with traditional single channel MAC.

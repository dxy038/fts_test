In order to simulate the real multi-layer plate structure, a DOF coupling algorithm of nodes and inner points of element based on constraint equation is proposed in this paper. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is let the DOF of the nodes on the constraint surface coupling with the DOF of the inner point of the element on the objective surface which can be expressed by the nodes DOF. By this way, the coupling formula is a multi-nodes constraint equation in fact. It can be seen that the von-mises stress distribution is more reasonable and reliable and meet the analysis needs comparing with the computed results by using the method of direct coupling nodes and the element type of MPC 184.

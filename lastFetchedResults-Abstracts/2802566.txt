In this age of explosive growth in information exchanges, there is indeed no time at which security does not matter. One of the symmetric encryption algorithms, DES, has kept its dominant position in the area of data encryption over the last few decades. However, with a rapid development in the field of computer hardware, DES has already been proved insecure. It takes a short time to translate the ciphertext to its corresponding plaintext using brute-force method at a reasonable cost. This is mainly due to the small key size DES employed. Given these issues, the objective of this article is to suggest an alternative on DES to obtain higher security and better execution efficiency by increasing the key size and updating the iteration technique. Comparisons were conducted with both DES and the advanced DES named triple DES (3DES). The results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms both previous algorithms.

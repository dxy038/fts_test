This article aims to investigate to what extent the theory of labeling beside structural theories (of both subjective and objective kind), rational choice and social control theories are able to predict the probability of re-imprisonment rate after re-commitment of the crime. The researchers applied a survey method and the respondents were prisoners with at least two records of accusation. The sample consisted of 340 prisoners, 98 females and 242 males, who were selected by using stratified, systematic and random strategies from a long list containing the names of the prisoners with imprisonment records. The data were gathered by administering a questionnaire developed by the researchers. The results indicated that the most important factors in predicting re-imprisonment rate were related to the following theories, respectively: labeling, rational choice, structural (related to objective dimension, i.e. social status, kind of crime), structural (related to subjective dimension, i.e. social and economic satisfaction and sense of discrimination) and control theories.  Moreover, the results showed that the above-mentioned theories altogether helped explain the prediction coefficient. The results were analyzed sociologically. It was concluded that the lesser importance of structural (of subjective dimension) and control theories may be related to the prisonersâ€™ similar situation in this respect, since the sample included all recorded prisoners. It was further concluded that the society should be held responsible to re-consider social interactions with the released prisoners who re-enter prison.

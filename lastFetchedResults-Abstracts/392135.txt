The objective of this study was to quantify the anaesthetic effect of EMLA cream during transtympanic electrocochleography (TTECochG) and thereby to determine if the application of EMLA should be recommended in routine practice of electrocochleography (ECochG). ECochG provides useful information in patients with inner ear fluid disorders. A major concern regarding transtympanic positioning of the electrode in ECochG is patient discomfort. Previous work has suggested that EMLA cream may make this technique more tolerable to patients. A prospective randomized study was performed evaluating the discomfort associated with unilateral TTECochG in a group where EMLA cream was used to anaesthesize the tympanic membrane (n=24), and in a group where no anaesthesia was used (n=22). A statistically significant difference was evident between the discomfort ratings of the groups (P<0.0001, Mannâ€“Whitney U test), the discomfort being greater in the no anaesthesia group. EMLA cream has thus been shown to alleviate the level of discomfort associated with TTECochG and so to be an acceptable modification of this technique.

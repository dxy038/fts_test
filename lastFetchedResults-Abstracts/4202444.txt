Helical explosive magnetic generators (HEMG) represent the inductive generators of electromagnetic energy. Operation of HEMG is based on compression of magnetic field, preliminary delivered to the helical coil, by the metal armature, placed coaxially in the coil center and expanding during an explosion. Circuit compression results in a decrease of its inductance, while the magnetic energy and the current increase. Current in HEMG reaches a magnitude of several dozen million amperes. When using HEMG, the designers, as a rule, try to get the maximum energy the generator is designed for. It means that usually explosive magnetic generators operate under limiting conditions. The objective of this work is to reduce the risk during explosive experiments by obtaining the possibility to develop new, and to use the available, HEMGs with guaranteed margins for the critical parameters.

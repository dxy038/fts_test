Time budgeting, which assigns timing assertion at block boundary, is a crucial step in hierarchical design. The proportion of high- and low-V<sub>t</sub> gates of each block, which determines overall leakage power consumption, is dictated by timing assertion, yet dual-V<sub>t</sub> allocation is not taken into account during conventional time budgeting. Bounded potential slack is introduced as a measure of dual-V<sub>t</sub> allocation, and is experimentally shown to be strongly correlated with the percentage of high-V<sub>t</sub> gates. A new time budgeting is proposed with objective of achieving bounded potential slack, which is formulated as a linear programming problem. In experiments with example hierarchical designs implemented in 45-nm commercial technology, the proposed time budgeting reduced leakage power by 32% on average compared to conventional time budgeting, when both are followed by the same dual-V<sub>t</sub> allocation. The time budgeting is also applied to voltage island design, where each block can have its own V<sub>dd</sub> with mix of high- and low-V<sub>t</sub> gates.

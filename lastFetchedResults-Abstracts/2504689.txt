Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) is a very rare genetic syndrome, and fewer than 500 cases have been reported in the world. Patients exhibit typical cutaneous involvement with hyperkeratosis, especially on the soles and palms, and early shedding of primary teeth. Internal organ involvements, such as liver abscesses, have been described in case reports. This  communication  represents  the  first  time  that  genetically  documented  PLS  with footprints of mycobacterium tuberculosis in liver and kidney is reported. T-Lymphocyte transformation Test with PHA was abnormal in this patient.

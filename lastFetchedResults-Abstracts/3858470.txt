Circuits that provide a transient and steady-state measure of slip and speed for rotating machines are described. A basic stroboscope consisting of very few components, all solid state, is also described and this can be used for the measurement, under steady conditions, of synchronous machine load-angle, of speed, and also, to a limited extent, of slip. The circuit designs are modular in character and where possible integrated circuits have been used, so that students may reasonably be able to understand not only the principle of the equipment but also, when educationally desirable, something of the circuitry as well. A further objective in developing these measuring devices has been simplicity of construction and economy of components so that multiple facilities can be provided for power teaching laboratories at a minimal cost.

Prediction of leaf area is essential in crop simulation models. The objective of this study was to find relationships between leaf area (LA) cm2.plant-1 and numbers of leaves on main stem (NLMS), leaf dry weight (LDW) g.plant-1, total dry weight of vegetative organs (leaf and stem) (TDWV) g.plant-1 and plant height (PH) cm, in wheat. For this purpose, an experiment was conducted using seven wheat cultivars including two durum wheat (Triticum durum) cultivars (Arya and Dena) and five bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars (Darya, Kuhdasht, Shiroudi, Tajan and Zagros) under irrigated and rainfed conditions at research farm of the Gorgan University of Agricultural and Natural Resources Sciences, Gorgan, Iran, in 2008-2009 cropping season. The experimental design was randomized complete block with four replications. Sampling was performed during the whole growing season. In each sampling; LA, NLMS, LDW, TDWV and PH, were measured and recorded. Segmented nonlinear regression model was used to describe allometric relationships between LA and the vegetative characteristics. Results showed that there was no significant difference between cultivars and the two conditions in respect to coefficients of allometric relationships. Therefore, one equation was used for all cultivars under both conditions. Significant relationships were found between LA and NLMS (R2 = 0.92), LDW (R2 = 0.96), TDWV (R2 = 0.95) and PH (R2 = 0.91). These equations can be used in simulation models of wheat as well as for the fast and easy estimation of leaf area, especially where there is no necessary equipments available.

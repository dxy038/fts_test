An all-optical 2R regenerator, based on a compact self-seeded Fabry-Peacuterot laser diode with a 10-mm-long embedded fiber Bragg grating cavity, and a bidirectional erbium-doped fiber amplifier, is proposed and experimentally demonstrated to execute all-optical 2R regeneration at 10 Gb/s. Compared with the conventional 1R regeneration, the proposed scheme has achieved significant 6.4-dB improvement of power penalty at bit-error ratio =10<sup>-9</sup> in the transmission experiment over 100-km standard single-mode fiber

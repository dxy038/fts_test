Migration of Android Native Application to Hybrid Application is a good choice since Hybrid Application is cross-platform in nature and has many other attractive features to offer but migrating an application from native to hybrid requires a lot of preparation for analyzing the complete process and dealing with the serious glitches expected during this process because any inappropriate step can drastically affect the success of an application. Therefore, the main objective of our work is to analyze and choose right migration methodology which would reduce developer´s efforts, time and cost of development and would also help in optimizing the issues faced for yielding better end results. Migration Approach may vary depending upon the requirement, architecture, size/complexity and purpose of the application, there can be many other important factors also like targeted devices/browsers. Therefore, it would be wise to analyze and evaluate each and every move prior to performing the migration. Considering these aspects, our research paper has presented some concrete solutions which shall help in identifying the right methodology for effective and successful migration. To validate our research work, we picked our own application entitled Student´s Portal which was built as an android application earlier and is now migrated to hybrid application by adopting the relevant and appropriate migration approach.

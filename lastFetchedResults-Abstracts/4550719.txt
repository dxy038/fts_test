Up to now, in the development of power electronics systems, the reduction of the initial costs or the increase of the power density have been of primary concern. However, with increasing energy costs also the power conversion efficiency is gaining higher and higher importance. Accordingly, while maintaining high power density, an efficiency as high as possible must be obtained. In this paper the maximum attainable efficiency and the dependency of the efficiency limit on technological parameters is determined for single-phase PFC boost rectifiers. In a first step basic PFC boost rectifier topologies are briefly compared with regard to high efficiency and a dual-boost PFC rectifier with integral common-mode filtering is selected as basis for the investigations. Next, simple approximations of the technological limits of the system performance are calculated in the efficiencypower density plane. With this, the Feasible Performance Space and the reduction in power density which has to be accepted for increasing the efficiency are clarified, and the trade-off limit curve (Pareto Front) of a multi-objective, i.e. efficiency and power density design optimization is determined. Furthermore, a comprehensive numerical efficiency optimization is carried out which identifies an efficiency limit of 99.2% for a 3.2kW system. The theoretical considerations are verified by experimental results from a laboratory prototype of the ultra-high efficiency system achieving 99.1% efficiency at a power density of 1.1kW/din<sup>3</sup>, as well as those firom an ultra-compact dual-boost PFC rectifier (95.8%, 5.5kW/dn<sup>3</sup>) and a very low switching freluency (3kHz) conventional PFC boost rectifier (96.7%, 2kW/din<sup>3</sup>). Finally, the sensitivity of the efficiency optimum with regard to various technological parameters is analyzed and an outlook on the further course of the research is given.

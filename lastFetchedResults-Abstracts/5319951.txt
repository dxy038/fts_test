This paper addressed the difficulties and challenges facing the wireless sensor networks on the battlefield cased by misdirection attack. WSNs is often vulnerable to attackerpsilas either in the routing or forwarding data and attempt to consume a lot of energy by sending a large quantity of useless packets. The main objective of the intruder is to misdirect the incoming messages to increase the latency, which prevents a few packets from reaching the base station. Remain unnoticed, the attacker keeps sending its own messages to its legitimate parent. The simulations showed that these solutions can help secure data and saved 40% of energy consumed.

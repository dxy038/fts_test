Blind source separation (BSS) is an emerging field of fundamental research with a wide range of applications such as remote sensing, data communications, speech processing and medical diagnosis. It is motivated by practical scenarios that involve multi-sources and multi-sensors. The key objective of BSS is to retrieve the source signals without resorting to any a priori information about the source signals and the transmission channel. In this paper, a second order statistics based technique and the corresponding algorithm are presented to perform the blind separation of stationary or cyclostationary sources. Finally, a case study with real data having as subject dams displacements monitoring is presented.

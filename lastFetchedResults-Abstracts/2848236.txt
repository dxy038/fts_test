In order to solve the problem that model predictive control, MPC, is difficult to apply to the large scale system or fast dynamic system, in this paper, we describe a new fast online optimization predictive control method. This method is to exploit the structure of the QPs that arise in MPC, reorder the appropriate variable and use the advanced interior-point to improve the control performance and achieve the rapid control objective. At the same time, we apply the method to the 3-DOF helicopter, and make a comparison between the fast MPC and the traditional MPC. The advantage of the fast MPC are concluded.

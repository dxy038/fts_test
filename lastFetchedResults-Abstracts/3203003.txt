The mapping mechanism from fuzzy colored Petri nets (FCPN) to fuzzy production rules (FPR) has not been well investigated, and has become a bottleneck to construct a rule-based system. To fill the gap, this paper develops bidirectional structural mapping models. According to the models, an encoder achieves the mapping function from FCPN to FPR. An instance is presented to illustrate the developed models are feasible and suitable for modeling a rule-based system. The objective of this article is to provide the bidirectional structural mapping models between FCPN and FPR. The main contribution of this work is that an inverse mapping mechanism from FCPN to FPR is developed. As a result, this work furnishes a novel mapping models, and lays a preliminary foundation for further fundamental and applied research.

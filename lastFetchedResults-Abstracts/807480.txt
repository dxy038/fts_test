A new model for overtaking on highway is proposed. The model considers such important factors as the reactive delay time for vehicle acceleration, deceleration, and lane-changing, the safe distance for car-following and the distance for overtaking. The time required for overtaking, the time loss in overtaking procedure and the spaceâ€“time evolution of vehicle movement are numerically investigated using the model and compared with the results from a survey. Numerical results show that our model can generate the traffic in accord with the observed one. The overtaking in a two-lane bidirectional traffic flow is also analyzed.

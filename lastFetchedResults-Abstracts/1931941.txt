The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of induction of estrus, synchronization of ovulation and timed artificial insemination in anestrous yaks using the Heatsynch protocol. In Experiment 1, 10 anestrous yaks were administered an analogue of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) followed by prostaglandin (PG)F2α 7 days later and then estradiol cyponate (ECP) 24 h after that. Ovulation was detected by rectal palpation at 2 h intervals beginning at the initial signs of estrus. Blood samples were collected at 2 h intervals beginning at the time of ECP injection up to 2 h after the occurrence of ovulation for the determination of LH and progesterone. All the animals responded to the Heatsynch protocol with expression of estrus and synchronization of ovulation. The mean time interval from the ECP injection to ovulation was 59.4 ± 2.62 h (range 50–72 h). The interval from the LH peak to ovulation was 30.2 ± 2.3 h. The high degree of synchrony in ovulation could be attributed to the synchrony in the timing of LH peaks. In Experiment 2, 10 anestrous yaks were treated with the Heatsynch protocol (as in Experiment 1) and TAI was performed at 48 and 60 h after the ECP treatment. Concurrently, 16 cycling yaks were inseminated approximately 12 h after detection of spontaneous estrus. Pregnancy rates were similar in both groups, 40% for TAI and 43.75% for yaks inseminated following spontaneous estrus (p &gt; 0.05). From this study, two conclusions can be drawn. First, the Heatsynch protocol can be successfully used to induce and synchronize estrus in anestrous yaks and, second, ovulation following the Heatsynch protocol is synchronized adequately to permit the use of fixed time AI in this species.

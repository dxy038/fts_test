In the study, we focus on the water quality monitoring and mapping using remote sensing .The objective of the research is to develop a precise and fast way of monitoring water chemical and biochemical quality of the water resources reservation area in the upper region of Huangpu River in Shanghai, China. One scene Thematic Mapper (TM) image in summer of 2005 was acquired and the simultaneous <i>in</i> <i>situ</i> measurement, sampling and analysis were performed. The main methods include radiometric calibration of TM remote sensor, atmospheric correction to image data and statistical model construction. The results indicate that satellite-based estimates and <i>in</i> <i>situ</i> measured water reflectance have high correlation, and a statistical relationship between calibrated image data (average of 5 times 5 pixels) of TM bands and laboratory analyzed data of water samples indicated that the reflectance of TM band 1 to band 4 and organic pollution measurements such as BOD and COD had higher correlation.

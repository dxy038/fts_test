Abstract

Objective

Environmental hazards, including poisons, can cause irreparable effects and even be fatal for children. Poisoning in children is common and serious, but often is preventable and treatable. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of drugs and chemical toxicity leading to apnea. In addition, we detected type of drug that induced apnea among children.

Materials & Methods

In a retrospective cross-sectional study from Apr 2012 to Apr 2013, sampled data of all hospitalized drug-induced apnea children were collected through hospital records.

Results

The most common cause of drug toxicity was methadone syrup (74%). The mortality rate was 3.1%; all of them due to methadone poisoning.

Conclusion

There was a high prevalence of apnea and poisoning of methadone in children.

Methadone poisoning should be considered in apnea.

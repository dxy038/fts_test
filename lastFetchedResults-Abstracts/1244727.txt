The objective of our study was to identify and interpret the various processes during development of upward positive leaders from tall structures. We provide a physical interpretation for the varying luminosity of the leader channel during its initial ascent and the pulsing luminosity during much later stages of the established leader. Our analysis confirms that pulsed luminosity is a result of recoil leaders intercepting the current-carrying channel connected to ground. This interception produces an M-component. Applying the bidirectional leader concept and a simplified electrostatic approximation, we introduce physical models of the dart leader-return stroke sequence and the M-component.

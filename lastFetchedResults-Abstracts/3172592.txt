In this paper voltage stability is evaluated by both dynamic P-V curves and time-domain simulations, considering the dynamic control effects of a static var compensator (SVC) and under load tap changing (ULTC) transformer. The proposal in this paper is to use ANN to prediction the ULTC tap ration and SVC susseptance of the voltage stabilty of power system. The objective of this paper is the determination of the critical loading points with bifurcation analysis using a neural network and the comparasion of the ULTC and SVC on the dynamical voltage stabilization. The simulation results and prediction values were obtained using the MATLAB/SIMULINK and NeuroXL prediction simulator respectively.

Distributed Generation (DG) generally means power generation in consumption locality. But sometimes, it Told technologies that use renewable energies for power generation. This paper presents a method for optimal sitting and sizing of DG in distribution systems. In this paper, our aim would be optimal distributed generation allocation and sizing for several parameters, include: voltage profile improvement, loss reduction, and THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) reduction in distribution networks. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used as the solving tool, which referring determined aim, the problem is defined and the objective function is introduced. Considering the fitness values sensitivity in PSO algorithm process, it is needed to apply load flow and harmonic calculations for decision-making. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated for typical distribution network, and it is compared with the GA method in terms of the solution quality and computation efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed PSO method is indeed capable of obtaining higher quality solutions efficiently.

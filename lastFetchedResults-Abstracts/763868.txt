Introduction: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common invasive cancers, and is responsible for physical and psychosocial morbidity. Therefore, Quality of Life (QOL) is an important outcome for these patients. Although extensive research has examined QOL in patients with colorectal cancer, less research has examined factors that predict QOL. 
Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the predictive factors of QOL in patients with colorectal cancer.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we assessed 110 patients with colorectal cancer who referred to Razi hospital. Data were collected by interview with patients and review of medical records. Health related QOL was evaluated by SF-36. The Data were analyzed with descriptive and deductive statistic methods (Generalized Linear Models) at ?  <  0.05 using SPSSv.16 software.
Results: Out of 110 patients with colorectal cancer, 58.2 % of them were men. Mean age of patients was 58.33 ± 12.39 years. Mean of Karnofsky performance status was 87.64 ± 9.27 and mean of comorbidity was 1.31±1.89. Mean of health related QOL was 70.92 ±15.56. In regression analysis gender, job status, living condition, insurance, hospitalization number, performance status and comorbidity were predictors of health related QOL in patients with colorectal cancer.
Conclusion: Predictors of health related QOL was socio-demographic factors included gender, job status, living condition, insurance and health/disease factors included hospitalization number, comorbidity and performance status in patients with colorectal cancer.

Carbon nanotube (CNT) has emerged as potential candidate for replacement of conventional metal patch. The principal objective of our research is to develop nanostructure based flexible patch antenna array for multi frequency operation in Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. Patch antenna design using CNT on flexible cotton sheets and CNT silver composites as conductive patch and ground plane has been simulated. Due to high conformability and conductivity of CNT all antenna parameters like VSWR, Return loss, Gain and radiation pattern meet design criteria. Our simulated antenna shows a return loss less than -10 dB and VSWR less than 2 at 2.06 GHz, 2.38 GHz and 2.49 GHz. A simulation of a versatile and conformable antenna design has also been done wherein the whole geometry is rolled up like patch array on cylindrical surface. This brings about conformability to the curved surfaces and integration with the structure which results in a unique antenna design.

Dynamic task assignment is a critical issue in the control of dynamic multi-team systems. An interesting example of dynamic task assignment is the deployment of fighting units on each side during a military operation. An initial deployment of resources by a top commander may not always result in the most desirable outcome. A reassignment of the units to different tasks during the course of operation may then become necessary in order to achieve the required objective. In this paper, the possibilities of changing the initial assignment of certain units, and the deployment of units after completing their initial assignment to other tasks are investigated. Two typical cases requiring specific reassignment strategies are considered. Because of the complexity in optimizing multi-team dynamic systems, we consider only the two-step lookahead Nash strategy as the approach to determine the optimal reassignment. We show that the use of reassignment strategies can improve the performance of the overall system and thus provide the team leader with a more flexible and effective control mechanism to achieve the overall desired objective.

In this paper, the power quality (PQ) requirements for demanding loads are presented. The economic impacts associated with PQ are characterized. Conventional solutions using lead acid batteries and diesel engines are facing increasing opposition due to environmental concerns. Clean distributed generation is presented as potentially interesting option to provide high levels of power supply reliability. A proton exchange membrane fuel cell is being used to build an uninterruptible power system. The main objective of this work is to analyze the output power of the fuel cell generation system based on some power quality parameters such as THD and power factor, among others. Simulation and experimental results of the fuel cell DC/AC power converter operation are presented.

The design of automatic carrier landing system is a crucial technique for carrier-based aircraft, since it facilitates landing of aircraft on carriers in various severe weather conditions, such as low visibility, heavy wind and rough sea conditions, which can hardly be achieved by manual control. In this paper, a novel method of optimizing the control parameters in the automatic carrier landing system of F/A-18A is developed, which is based on simplified Brain Storming Optimization (BSO) algorithm. The gains in the inner loop are optimized by fitting the frequency response curve of the closed-loop system with a desired frequency response curve. The control parameters in the autopilot and auto-throttle control module are optimized by minimizing a set of objective functions defined in the time domain. Comparative experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

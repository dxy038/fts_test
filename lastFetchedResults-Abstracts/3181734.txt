Objective: In order to improve detection method of non-invasive pulse wave detector, taking into account the operation complexity of the radial artery test, a simple finger pulse detection are choose. Methods: Through a large number of clinical data analyses, the conversion relationship of the radial artery pulse detection and volume pulse wave detection was determined, hemodynamic parameters based on the volume pulse wave were calculated and test results were compared with results of echocardiography. Results: The differences of hemodynamic parameters detected by volume pulse and echocardiography were not statistically significant. Conclusion: It is showed that the application of cardiac output and other blood flow parameters detection by the method of volume pulse wave is feasible.

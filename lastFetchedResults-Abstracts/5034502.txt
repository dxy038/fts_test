This paper studies the control configuration of a Microgrid Connected Photo Voltaic (MCPV) source. In the control of a MCPV, maximum power point (MPP) tracking, droop control and DC bus voltage regulation are the main required functions. To increase their penetration in the microgrid, MCPV sources have to participate in the microgridÂ´s frequency regulation. Consequently, MCPV may be forced to depart from MPP for short periods of time. In this paper, a control method is proposed to operate the MCPV in the MPP at all times except when there is a need to stabilize the frequency. The method achieves this objective autonomously without any need to change the control configuration. This method is explained and its superiority over other controllers to achieve the same objective is investigated. The parameters of the universal controller are selected such that the controller can achieve the required performance. The suggested control configurations are validated through simulation studies.

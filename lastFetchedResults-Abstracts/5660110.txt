This paper presents a methodology for optimal distributed generation (DG) location and sizing in distribution systems. The main objective of the added DG units is minimizing the total electrical network losses with acceptable voltage profile. Genetic Algorithm (GA) Technique is used as the optimization searching algorithm due to its advantages over the other optimization techniques in this application. The system losses and voltage profile evaluation is based on a power flow analysis for the distribution network with the representation of the distributed generators using MATPOWER software package. Cost Benefit Factor (CBF) is used to evaluate the benefits of the added DG units to the system performance. This factor combined the cost of adding new DG unit with the saving gained from total power losses reduction and reserved power generation. The optimization algorithm is applied to two different test distribution systems; 13-Bus radial system and actual 66 kV distribution network of Alexandria, EGYPT. The results indicated that if the DG units are placed at their optimal location and have optimal sizing, the total distribution system losses will be reduced.

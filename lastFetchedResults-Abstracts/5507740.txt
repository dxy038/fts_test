In this paper, we present a forwarding strategy for two-stage bidirectional relaying in which trellis-coded modulation (TCM) is employed. We reveal that adaptive network coding cannot resolve distance shortening occurred at specific channel conditions when a certain TCM is used. To overcome this issue, we introduce an improved amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme termed pseudo AF (PAF). The proposed strategy adaptively switches network coding and PAF according to the channel information. Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve throughput performance.

Diagnosis of asthma in the preschoold children is difficult due to lack of objective lung function tests suitable for this age group. Impedance pneumography (IP) is a mode of measurement that may potentially enable ambulatory 24h recording of tidal breathing indices and respiratory dynamics that are known to relate to small airway obstruction. The aim of this research was to induce changes in breathing control and mechanics and study the ability of IP to reproduce TBFVC and track its changes under potentially difficult conditions. This was achieved by a comparison of direct mouth pneumotachograph (PNT) and IP tidal breathing flow-volume curves (TBFVC) during free breathing and expiratory loading obtained from 17 young lung-healthy subjects. The expiratory loading produced strong and significant changes in the respiratory pattern and mouth pressure. The agreement of PNT and IP normalized TBFVCs was found excellent having the highest distance between the normalized TBFVCs of (mean&#177;SD) 7.4 %&#177;3.6 % and 6.2 %&#177;3.0 % during free and loaded breathing, respectively. The agreement was not affected by the presence of the expiratory load despite it poses multiple potential hazards for the IP measurements. We conclude that by using correct electrode placement and cardiac filtering, IP was able to accurately reproduce and track changes in normalized TBFVCs under normal and abnormal respiratory conditions in healthy adult subjects.

Despite the importance of the effects of inadmissible loads in the reduction of the life cycle and operation time of bridges, there is no scientific and systematic procedure for the deterioration analysis of bridges under overloaded vehicles. The main objective of this article is to outline a methodology for determining the damage effects of inadmissible loads on concrete bridge decks, considering the fatigue effect. With recourse to the fatigue phenomenon, the relationships
between the passing loads and the number of allowable load cycles were determined. These relationships were the basesfor constructing models by which the deterioration ratios of concrete bridges couId be assessed and, consequently, the amount of fi nes for vehicles can be caIculated.

A single-compartment lung model has been used to describe the dynamic pulmonary mechanical function in six intubated and ventilated newborn infants with a birth weight less than 1500 grams. Two model parameters, resistance and compliance, were used and derived for single breaths using a linear regression technique. Parameter values were calculated for whole breaths, the inspiratory phase and the expiratory phase. The main objective has been to detect any significant changes of the elastic and resistive properties of the respiratory system related to different ventilator settings. The estimated resistance and compliance parameter values changed significantly in 13 out of 15 cases.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

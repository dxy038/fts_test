A three level control system for a variable speed wind energy conversion scheme (VSWECS) supplying a weak AC power system is presented. The objective of the control strategy is to maximize energy capture and simultaneously to support the voltage of the bus where the VSWECS is connected. Using an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) inverter, both control of active and reactive power supplied to the grid and reduction of harmonic distortion can be achieved. The response of the proposed scheme has been tested and evaluated in a test system using a developed computer program simulating in detail the system operation

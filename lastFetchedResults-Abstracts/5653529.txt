The most common way of multi-objective optimizations is assigning a weight to each objective and construct a single fitness function. In this method finding of the appropriate weights is the most important problem. The second method, which is not very well-known for power system researchers, is to optimize the objectives independently. Many optimum answers are achieved instead of a single one. These optimum results are known as Pareto front. The Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are two successful approaches, which obtain the Pareto front. Nowadays, Distributed Generations (DGs) are widely used in the power systems to improve the overall conditions of the network. One of the most important issues about a DG is its optimum size and place allocation. In this paper, the two aforementioned algorithms are employed to find the optimum sizes and places of DG installation while DG cost and system total power loss are optimization objectives. These procedures give several results, which all of them are optimal and designer could select one of them according to his interest the results are compared with that of GA that optimizes weighted sum of objectives.

We report a new passive optical network (PON) architecture to reduce customer transmitter cost using an upstream repeater at the remote node. The system can further provide both downstream and upstream regeneration by utilising standard bidirectional transceivers. Our architecture can extend a conventional PONÂ´s feeder fibre reach to 50 km and split ratio to 1:256. The system demonstration shows insignificant penalty to the existing network performance and meets the IEEE 802.3ah standard requirements.

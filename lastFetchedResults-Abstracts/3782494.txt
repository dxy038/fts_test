This letter presents the results of the search for optimum punctured recursive convolutional codes (RCCs) of rate k/k+1, for k=2,...,8, suitable for concatenated channel codes whose constituent encoders are recursive, systematic convolutional codes. The mother codes that are punctured are rate-1/2 RCCs proposed for use in parallel and/or serial concatenation schemes. Extensive tables of systematic and nonsystematic puncturing patterns, optimized relative to various objective functions suitable for concatenated channel codes, are presented for several mother codes.

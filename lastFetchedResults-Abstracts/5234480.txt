Unidirectional constant frequency (CF) quasi-resonant (QR) converters can be implemented using two current-bidirectional switches. Therefore, the bidirectionality in current can be obtained from these unidirectional converters without having to change anything at all in the power circuit. A family of zero-current switching (ZCS) and zero-voltage switching (ZVS) CF-QR bidirectional converters is reported using the concept of a CF-QR bidirectional switch. The analysis, operating characteristics, and design considerations for a buck/boost CF-ZVS/ZCS-QR converter are discussed. A design example is also included

Mode detection in online handwritten documents refers to the process of distinguishing different types of contents, such as text, formulas, diagrams, or tables, one from another. In this paper a new approach to mode detection is proposed that uses bidirectional long-short term memory (BLSTM) neural networks. The BLSTM neural network is a novel type of recursive neural network that has been successfully applied in speech and handwriting recognition. In this paper we show that it has the potential to significantly outperform traditional methods for mode detection, which are usually based on stroke classification. As a further advantage over previous approaches, the proposed system is trainable and does not rely on user-defined heuristics. Moreover, it can be easily adapted to new or additional types of modes by just providing the system with new training data.

The rapid and objective measurement of timing intervals of the electrocardiogram (ECG) by automated systems is superior to the subjective assessment of ECG morphology. The timing interval measurements are usually made from the onset to the termination of any component of the EGG, after accurate detection of the QRS complex. This article describes a real-time system that uses wavelet transforms to overcome the limitations of other methods of detecting QRS and the onsets and offsets of P- and T-waves. Wavelet transformation is briefly discussed, and detection methods and hardware and software aspects of the system are presented, as well as experimental results.

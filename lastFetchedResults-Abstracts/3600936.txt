Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been recently established for several systems such as HiperLAN/2 and Digital video/audio broadcasting, due the easy implementation of the modulator/demodulator and the equalizer. Moreover, also increasing interest is currently being put on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, based on the use of antenna arrays at both the transmitter and the receiver. Here, we propose two joint beamforming strategies of low computational load for systems combining OFDM and MIMO. The ultimate objective is the maximization of the signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SNIR) over the carriers subject to a total transmit power constraint. Specifically, the maximization of the harmonic SNIR mean and the minimum SNIR over the subcarriers are proposed. The asymptotic behavior of the proposed methods is analyzed to provide a complete comparative and general view of the most relevant and already known transmit power allocation strategies. Finally, a theoretical analysis of the performance degradation of these techniques is carried out for the case in which the channel state information (CSI) is not perfect. Monte Carlo simulation results for the system bit-error rate and performance degradation with imperfect CSI are provided.

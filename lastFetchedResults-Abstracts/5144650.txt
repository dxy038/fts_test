We have improved the ordinary total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). Two improvements have been achieved, one is the interface between opaque material and solution can be observed, another is the interface far away (usually several ten micro meters) the objective lens can be observed. By this improved TIRFM, the adsorption of protein molecules at a crystal/solution interface had been successfully observed. We have obtained the results of relationship between the amount of adsorbed protein molecules on bunched steps and the height of bunched steps of a protein crystal.

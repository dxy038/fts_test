Background and Objective: Pelvic girdle and respiratory muscles weakness and hyperglycemia are associated with reduced lung capacity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of core muscles strengthening on pulmonary function in obese women with type II diabetes. 

Materials and Methods: The population of the research were all women with diabetes type II in District 2 of Yazd. Twenty four patients with diabetes type II, aged 40-55 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 30.32 ± 4.18 kg.m² and fasting blood glucose greater than 126 mg /dl were selected by purposive sampling. First, the anthropometric variables and indices of lung function were measured, then subjects were randomly divided into two groups (experimental, n=14 and control, n=10). Core resistance training was done for 12 weeks (3 days/week, 60 to 75 minutes) for experimental group. Lung function indices were assessed by spirometry.

Results: Core resistance trainings significantly reduced WC (p=0.001), WHR (p=0.04), FEV1/FVC (p=0.001) and fasting blood glucose (p=0.001) and increased FVC (p=0.001), FEV1 (p=0.001) as compared with pre-test measures, whereas body weight and BMI remained unchanged in experimental group (p?0.05). 

Conclusion: Blood glucose control can be effective in reducing pulmonary complications. Therefore, exercise training programs that can lower blood glucose levels in diabetic patients, are effective therapeutic interventions for improving lung function. According to the results, core resistance trainings that strengthen the core muscles such as diaphragm are effective to improve lung function.

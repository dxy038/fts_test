Background: Dementia is a common health problem in the elderly. Studies have shown that levels of pulse wave velocity (PWV) could predict cognitive impairment. The objective of this study was assessment of the relationship between arterial stiffness levels and cognitive status among the older people.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 60 individuals included 31 women and 29 men aged â‰¥ 60 years who were admitted to Khatam-Ol-Anbya hospital in Tehran and were eligible, were randomly selected according to admission code. Data such as demographic information, Global Deterioration Scale level, Geriatric Depression Scale -15 score, were collected by face to face interview. The arterial stiffness was measured using Sphygomocor system by calculation of carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity. Data analyzing was conducted using univariate and multivariable logestic regression models. 
Result: The mean age of the participants was 72.62 (7.62) and it was significantly higher in cognitive impairment than those who had normal cognition [73.40(7.36) vs. 70.27(8.00) respectively, P = 0.05]. The average years of the schooling in individuals with normal cognitive status was higher than the other groups (P < 0.01). Average pulse wave velocity in the participants was 11.81(4.11) meters per second. The PWV was significantly increased with the exacerbation of the cognitive impairment (7.24 m/s in normal group vs. 15.52 m/s in the severe cognitive impaired group, P < 0.01). 
Conclusion: The pulse wave velocity has an inverse relationship with cognitive status. It seems that arterial stiffness associates with lower levels of cognitive status independent to other cardiovascular risk factors.

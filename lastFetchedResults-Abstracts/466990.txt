Objective: In a previous study of women who had been sexually assaulted, we reported a 26% prevalence of a major psychiatric diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to better characterize sexual assaults in women with a major psychiatric diagnosis. Study Design: All female patients ≥15 years old with a complaint of sexual assault underwent a standardized history and physical examination by an upper-level resident in obstetrics and gynecology. Data were abstracted and verified. A psychiatric diagnosis was determined by history and by use of computer-linked medical records. Chi-square or Fisher exact test was used for categoric analysis. Results: Of the 819 women who were examined, 211 women (26%) had a major psychiatric diagnosis. In these 211 women, the prevalence of solely mood, thought, or substance use disorders were 26%, 14%, and 16%, respectively, whereas 44% had ≥2 diagnoses. Having a psychiatric diagnosis was associated with increasing age (P = .001), homelessness (P = .001), and incarceration (P = .001). In comparison with women with no psychiatric diagnosis, sexual assaults in these 211 women occurred more frequently outdoors (P = .007), by a stranger (P< .001), or by ≥2 assailants (P = .02). Being assaulted with a weapon (P = .04) and being hit (P = .01) were more prevalent in assaults against women with a psychiatric diagnosis, as was anal contact (P = .03), contact to ≥2 body orifices (P = .001), and body trauma (P = .01). Conclusion: Sexual assaults in women with a major psychiatric diagnosis are common. These assaults are more violent and result in body trauma more frequently than do sexual assaults in women without a psychiatric diagnosis. Prevention and treatment strategies should target this vulnerable population. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:1284-91.)

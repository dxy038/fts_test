The objective of this article is to demonstrate the versatility of applying ready designed mathematical software packages to the area of electric motor drives. All simulation interactive tools are based on linear and nonlinear mathematical models that in someway represent the physical behavior of the engineered system. Therefore, whether the simulation is carried out by dragged icons or by writing complicated equations, the result is a predication of the system behavior. The described procedures are helpful in assessing the performance and feasibility of the single and three phase variable speed drives using an IBM personal computer. Minimum knowledge of programming language is required and no great expense is incurred. The simulated study cases have been used in adult education training sessions and proved to be very successful

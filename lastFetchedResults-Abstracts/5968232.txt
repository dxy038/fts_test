Coordinated multi-cell processing facilitates multiuser preceding techniques across distributed base station (BS) antenna heads. Hence, it can efficiently exploit the available spatial degrees of freedom in a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. A generalised method for joint design of linear transceivers with coordinated multi-cell processing subject to per-BS/antenna power constraints is proposed. The system optimisation objective is to balance the weighted SINR across all the transmitted data streams. The method can accommodate a variety of scenarios from coherent multi-cell beamforming across a large virtual MIMO channel to single-cell beamforming with inter- cell interference coordination and beam allocation. The performance of different coherent/non-coherent and coordinated/non-coordinated multi-cell transmission methods with optimal and heuristic beam allocation algorithms is numerically compared in different scenarios with varying inter-cell interference. The coherent multi-cell beamforming greatly outperforms the noncoherent cases, especially at the cell edge and with a full spatial load. However, the coordinated single-cell transmission with interference avoidance and dynamic beam allocation performs considerably well with a partial spatial loading.

Hybrid Overlay Network (HONet) is a locality-aware hybrid overlay architecture, which combines the scalability and simplicity of a structured overlay with the connection flexibility of an unstructured overlay. In this paper, we propose Canicula, an improved HONet. First, using a simple and accurate network coordinate system, Canicula achieves more reliable node clustering. Secondly, Canicula uses an enhanced overlay construction method to reduce the impact of guarded hosts. The experimental results on over 450 PlanetLab nodes show that the ARDP in Canicula is only 45% of that in flat bidirectional Chord.

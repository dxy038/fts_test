Privacy and data protection are pivotal issues in nowadays society. They concern the right to prevent the dissemination of sensitive or confidential information of individuals. Many studies have been proposed on this topic from various perspectives, namely sociological, economic, legal, and technological. We have recognized the legal perspective as being the basis of all other perspectives. Actually, data protection regulations set the legal principles and requirements that must be met by organizations when processing personal data. The objective of this work is to provide a reference base for the development of methodologies tailored to design privacy-aware systems to be compliant with data protection regulations.

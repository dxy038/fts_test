We study the performance of greedy scheduling in multihop wireless networks where the objective is aggregate utility maximization. Following standard approaches, we consider the dual of the original optimization problem. Optimal scheduling requires selecting independent sets of maximum aggregate price, but this problem is known to be NP-hard. We propose and evaluate a simple greedy heuristic. We suggest how the greedy heuristic can be implemented in a distributed manner. We evaluate an analytical bound in detail, for the special case of a line graph and also provide a loose bound on the greedy heuristic for the case of an arbitrary graph.

Six electronic technologies under development for the Mars Technology Program are discussed. The scope of this set ranges from electronic packaging to microprocessors to power supply to communication technologies. An overview (motivation, objective, approach) of these six projects is presented, along with a comparison to the state-of-art. The overarching goal is to develop and mature these technologies to a point where the Mars Exploration Program can consider their use in a specific flight mission.

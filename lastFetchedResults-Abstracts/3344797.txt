This contribution addresses the critical question of sampling rates used to measure variables of interest by cyberphysical and environmental monitoring systems. The data used in this analysis were measured and recorded in a Brazilian forest canopy between 2007 and 2014. Through variogram analysis time series of air temperature, humidity, soil moisture and photosynthetically active radiation, this study provides practical recommendation of minimal sampling rates for the selected environmental variables. The objective is to determine the optimal sampling frequency to maintain sufficient temporal resolution of collected environmental data while minimizing the energy consumption of environmental monitoring devices. In addition to the direct benefit of energy savings, proper design of sampling regimes can also improve reliability and reduce the life-cycle costs of operating environmental monitoring systems.

Describes the development of the SimCon (SIMulation-based project CONtrol) system, which provides the basis for implementing progress reporting and control in a simulation model. The issues considered in SimCon include developing a reporting-by-exception capability from a hierarchical breakdown structure that minimizes progress reporting at the very detailed level. Simulation constructs are developed to store project progress information and simplify the logical linking of simulation processes. SimCon is implemented using object-oriented concepts, event-driven programming, relational databases and a simulation engine. The objective of this research is to improve construction management productivity in progress reporting and control and to improve decision-making by incorporating detailed resource-level interactions in project modeling

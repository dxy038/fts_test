Background and Objective: Shoulder rotator cuff tendonitis is very common. Each person experiences this disorder at
least once during his life. This problem is the third most common of the musculoskeletal disorders, after low back pain
and neck pain worldwide. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of low power laser and ultrasound in the
tlt:a[ment of the shoulder rotator cuff tendonitis.
Materials and Methods: This is a double blind clinical trial study performed in the Fattemieh physiotherapy clinic of
Rafsanjan In for 12 months, from 20 January 2007 to 20 January 2008. Ninty patients who were afflicated with rotator
cuff tendonitis of the shoulder were divided into three equal groups randomly (30 in each group). Patients were treated
in 10 sessins. Each group either received low power laser or ultrasound or none (control group). Intensity of the pain
and improvement of the movement was assessed during 1st, 51h and 10th sessions. Data were analyzed by SPSS.
Results: The results of this study showed that low power laser can be more effective than ultrasound in the relieveing
the pain among patients (p<O.OOO). Although, in 5" session, low power laser was more effective than ultrasound in
improving the movement of the shoulder (p<O.OOO), in the 10" session ultrasound was shown to be a better method
(p<O.OOO).
Conclosion: It can be concluded from our results that low power laser is a more suitable method for reducing the pain
of the shoulder rotator cuff tendonitis. However, ultrasound can be a more effective method for improving the
movement of the shoulder.

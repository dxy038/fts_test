Objective
 problems are common in patients with chronic illnesses. However, few studies have investigated problems with sexual functioning in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The present cross-sectional study assessed the influence of SLE on sexual functioning and its associations with illness perceptions and medical and socio-demographic characteristics.

udy included 106 SLE patients who used at least one immunosuppressive agent to control their SLE. Sexual functioning was measured using the Physical Disability Sexual and Body Esteem and the Medical Impact Scale from the Sexual Functioning Questionnaire. Patients' illness perceptions were assessed using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire.
s
of patients agreed that their SLE had a negative influence on their sexual functioning. In addition, treatment for SLE seemed to play an important role in the negative impact on sexual functioning. Patients' illness perceptions were more important predictors of sexual functioning than medical and socio-demographic characteristics. SLE patients appear to report a lower sexual functioning than patients with other chronic illnesses.
sion
 general and immunosuppressive treatment for SLE specifically have a negative influence on sexual functioning. Patients' illness perceptions appear to play a more important role in the negative impact on sexual functioning than medical characteristics such as disease activity. The high prevalence of sexual problems highlights the need to more frequently address and aim to improve sexual functioning in patients with SLE. Patients may benefit from methods such as illness perception modification and coping style interventions to reduce their sexual problems.

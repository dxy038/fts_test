The various psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders etc. are characterized by neuro-cognitive impairments in multiple cognitive domains. Hence, broad and sensitive tools are required for effective diagnosis and therapeutic management of the neuro-cognitive impairments pertaining to such disorders. Traditional neuro-cognitive tests used widely are associated with high cost and high administration time. Computerized neuropsychological batteries, however, have the potential to overcome the limitations posed by the traditional means. Various requirements were identified to develop a validated Smartphone based application intended to administer such a computerized battery to patients in the absence of a trained professional while enabling the same professionals, here the psychiatrists, to impart more effective treatment and additionally interpret the obtained data in a manner that sheds a new light on the implications of such batteries. An application and its implementation are described here which will achieve this two-fold objective.

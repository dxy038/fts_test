In this paper, the authors propose and analyze a network-based control architecture for power-electronics-building-block-based converters. The objective of the proposed approach is to distribute the control system to guarantee maximum flexibility in the control of power distribution. In the proposed control system, controller and controlled devices are connected through the network, which affects the measurement and control signals mostly due to delays. The main goal of this work is to outline a design methodology for controllers operating with measurements coming from a network. The approach proposed here assesses the robustness of the control system in the presence of delay and aims to design an optimal controller for robustness against network delays. This methodology is based on uncertainty analysis and assumes that the delays are the main element of uncertainty in the system. The theoretical foundations of this approach are discussed, together with the simulation and implementation of a physical laboratory prototype.

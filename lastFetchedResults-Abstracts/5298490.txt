In this paper, some results of the MIRAS-SMOS demonstrator campaigns are presented. The follow two campaigns were held: an image validation campaign at IRTA side and a flight demonstrator campaign at Finland. The ultimate objective of the airborne demonstrator is to demonstrate its imaging capabilities by applying improved calibration and inversion algorithms to natural low-contrast targets.

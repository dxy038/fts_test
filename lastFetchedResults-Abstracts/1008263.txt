Orthogonal machining of unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (UD-CFRP) composites is simulated using discrete element method (DEM). The objective of this work is to present a simple numerical model that allows the study the machining of unidirectional composites during orthogonal cutting. To control the physicochemical phenomena that occur during cutting, it is necessary to identify the parameters of contact, very difficult to measure experimentally. The DEM numerical simulation is presented then as an alternative to the problem. This tool has helped to recreate the physical mechanisms identified experimentally and to understand the origin of the abrasive wear of carbide tools. The observation of the chip formation using a high speed video camera made possible to validate qualitatively the results of numerical simulation by discrete elements. This tool can also determine the cutting forces quite close to reality.

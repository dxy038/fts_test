In this paper, firstly, optimization design mathematical model of floating crane balance system is constructed concretely under the multi-objective circumstance. Secondly, genetic algorithm is adopted as the optimization method, and then specific genetic operation flow is designed, genetic algorithm coding method, fitness function, operation parameters are determined, and the three basic genetic operation of genetic operator: choose, intersection and mutation, are to do a detailed programming instructions. Thirdly, the optimization results are obtained based on these in VC++6.0 environments, the optimal result are compared to the non-optimized value and the value reduces 16.74%. Finally, according to the resistive overturning stability requirement of floating crane, the optimization results are to be stability checked, so the rationality of optimization results are to be proved.

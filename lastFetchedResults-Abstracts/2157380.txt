Concerning the legal system governing the contracts concluded between the government and foreign investment companies, two widely-held views are presented by jurists. Some, resting on traditional ideas, consider the legal system governing the contracts signed by government as the national law of governmental treaties. But others hold that international rules, whether the traditional rules of private international law or transnational trading rules, determine the legal system which governs this particular kind of contracts. Apparently, in dealing with the contracts signed by government especially investment contracts, the only ideal solution will be to refer to the identified principles of inconsistency of laws, especially the objective rule, in order to the law which has strong connection to the contract. Generally speaking, the law which governs the contracts in different law systems is defined either by an objective standard or a private standard.

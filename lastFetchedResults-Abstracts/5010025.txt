The human side of innovation and change is often directly related to perceptions rather than objective measurements. In this study, 30 management attributes are examined, and how they are perceived in industry, government and academia. Nine interrelated cases were considered: how industry perceived itself, government and academia, how government perceived itself, industry and academia, and how academia perceived itself, government and industry. The 30 attributes were: (1) planning, (2) problem solving, (3) managing, (4) measuring, (5) developing people, (6) innovating, (7) contributing, (8) synthesizing, (9) operating effectively, (10) synergizing, (11) mobilizing, (12) accomplishing, (13) leading, (14) organizing, (15) implementing, (16) motivating, (17) experimenting,(18) continuously improving, (19) communicating, (20) building/using teams, (21) cooperating, (22) operating efficiently, (23) growing the enterprise, (24) responding to customers, (25) initiating, (26) making decisions, (27) moving quickly, (28)strategic thinking, (29) competing, (30) controlling costs. Patterns in these perceptions are clearly observed and presented. Potential influences on behaviors in the three sectors of industry, government and academia are explored.

In this study the main objective was to develop and demonstrate a glow discharge microplasma coupled to a miniature spectrometer for detection of fire signatures from pyrolyzing and burning spacecraft materials. Our experimental results demonstrate that combustion-produced carbonaceous aerosols can serve to identify the burning materials. Demonstrating versatility for chemistry analysis, the plasma detector could differentiate carbonaceous aerosols with different C/H ratios and distinguish inorganic samples such as salts and metal oxides from carbonaceous aerosols. In addition, in situ analysis of aerosol samples validated the microplasmaâ€™s analytical utility by linearity of its optical emission intensity with aerosol elemental composition.

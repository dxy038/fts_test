In this paper fuzzy fractal algorithm for discrete signal processing is introduced. The two major concepts of the algorithm are fuzzy fractal dimension and grade of fractality, which merge fuzzy theory and fractal theory. The fuzzy concept of fractality in discrete time series can be reconstructed as a kind of fuzzy set and the objective short time series can be used by a new membership function. In order to process long time series, sliding measurement is adopted. In the end, the local grade of fractality is applied to X-band real sea clutter and the performance of the detection algorithm is analyzed.

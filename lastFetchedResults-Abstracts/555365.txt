Background: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a fungal disease with itching, and thick white vaginal discharge. 70-75% of normal healthy adult women report having had at least one episode in their life; Candida albicans is identified as the most common cause. The objective of this study was to identify the different Candida species in the vaginal swabs of patients with vulvo-vaginitis. Methods: 175 vaginal swab specimens, from patients admitted in the Gynecology Department of Mahdieh Hospital with recurrent and non-recurrent vulvovaginitis, were cultured on SDA medium. The isolates were subcultured onto CHROM agar Candida medium and incubated at 37Â°C for 48h.
Results: In 89.7% of cases, single Candida species and in 10.3%, multiple Candida species were isolated. Frequency of different isolates was as follows: C. albicans (65.1%), C. glabrata (13.1%), C. tropicalis (6.2%), C. krusei (4%), C. guilliermondii (0.6%), C. parapsilosis (0.6%), C. glabrata and C. albicans (5.7%), C. albicans and Cparapsilosis (1.1%), C. glabrata and C. tropicalis (0.6%), C. krusei and C. tropicalis (0.6%), C. albicans and C. tropicalis (0.6%), C. krusei and C. albicans (0.6%), C. glabrata and C. krusei (0.6%), and C. glabrata and C. krusei and C. albicans (0.6%).
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that, the common cause of both recurrent and non-recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis was C. albicans, followed by C. glabrata.

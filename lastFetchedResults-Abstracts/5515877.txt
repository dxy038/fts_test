In this paper we investigate the self-organization and cognitive abilities of adaptive networks when the individual agents are allowed to move in pursuit of an objective. The network as a whole acts as an adaptive entity with localized processing and is able to respond to stimuli in real-time. We apply the ensuing model to the foraging behavior of fish schools in search of food sources and reproduce their ability to move in remarkable coherence.

A comprehensive design scheme of SIMO linear control systems is presented and applied to sinusoidal tracking of PWM inverters. Considering the design scheme, we deal with realizable transfer functions of control systems in general SIMO feedback configuration. As a result, a necessary and sufficient condition for transfer functions of achievable closed-loop maps is obtained. Based on the condition, we introduce a novel design scheme of linear control systems. Compared to conventional design scheme such as &#223;-parameter approach, the proposed one enables numerical optimization with a prescribed order of controller. Moreover, various multi-objective control requirements can be dealt with step by step in order of precedence. An illustrative example of the proposed design scheme applied to sinusoidal tracking of PWM inverters is investigated.

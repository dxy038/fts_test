Background and Objective: Enuresis is a problem in children. In this recearch the success, rate and recurrence of imipramine, desmopresine and conditional therapy has been studied in enuresis treatment of childrern.
Materials and methods: This study was done on 84 enuretic child between 7-1 1 years old which were selected by screening at the schools. Patients divided randomly to three groups: The first group received 25 mg of imipramine every night. The second group was treated with 20 micg of desmopresine intranasaly every night. The third group used alarm for conditioning every night. All groups were treated for one month, and two weeks without enuresis meaned success. Results: All physical finding and laboratory tests were normal in all patients (FBS, U/A, U/C, kidney and bladder sonography). Patients had in average 8.5 years old. 77.3% of cases were boys and 22.7% were girls. Success rate for therapy was 71.4%, b0%, and 50% in-groups 1-3 respectively. Recurrence rate 6 months after therapy was 10%, 55.5% and 25% in-groups 1-3 respectively.
Conclusion: Imipramine persists as cheep, available, well-tolerated and effective way of treating enuretic patients. Due to high recurrence rate, desmopresine is just recomended as a temporary treatment.

The objective of this paper is to design nonlinear observer-based excitation controller for power system comprising a single synchronous generator connected to an infinite bus and an exciter system. The controller proposed is based on using variable structure systems and singular perturbation system concepts, and the block control principle. A nonlinear observer for estimation of mechanical torque and rotor fluxes, is included. This combined approach enables one to compensate the inherent nonlinearities of the generator and to reject external disturbances

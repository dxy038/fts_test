Background: Whispering gallery modes (WGM) biosensors are ultrasensitive
systems that can measure amount of adsorbed layer onto the micro-cavity surface.
They have many applications including protein, peptide growth, DNA and bacteria
detection, molecular properties measurements and specific interaction and drug table
recognitions due to their high sensitivity, compact size and label free sensing mechanism.
Objective: In this paper we investigate the effect of buffer solution on detection
of specific biomolecules in WGM biosensors through its refractive index change.
Method: The propagation of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric microsphere is
analyzed by solving Maxwell’s equations through proper boundary condition to find
a concise relation for micro-cavity resonance shift.
Results: Analysis of the buffer solution’s refractive index effects on detection
of BSA by WGM biosensors are presented and it was shown that even a very small
change in the refractive index of buffer solution can affect the biosensor wavelength
shift and the sensitivity of biosensors.
Conclusion: This study opens up a discussion in biosensor sensitivity based on
true and reliable performance of the buffer solution through its accurate determination
of refractive index and behavior.To avoid expensive methods of enhancing sensitivity,
one can improve the sensitivity of WGM biosensor to some extent, by means
of using proper buffer solution.

Wind resource nearby offshore oil/gas platforms is often excellent due to higher average wind speed and lower turbulence intensity and wind shear compared to most onshore wind farm sites. Moreover, offshore oil/gas platforms are facing increasingly tougher challenges to operate in an environmentally acceptable manner. The main objective of this paper is to propose a feasible electrical grid layout for the wind farm integration into the offshore oil/gas platform and onshore AC grid and to design the system control strategy and analyze the power system stability. Two dynamic simulation cases are set up based on PSCAD/EMTDC, i.e. losing wind farm production and occurrence of onshore short circuit fault for studying transient behavior of the electrical network.

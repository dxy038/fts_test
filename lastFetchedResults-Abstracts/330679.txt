Objective. Polymerization shrinkage is still one of the main disadvantages of resin composite restorations (RC). Especially in cavities with a high C-factor, debonding can occur. A laminate restoration including a base with a more elastic behavior might result in a better adaptation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the durability of a combination of two techniques suggested to counter the stress formation in direct RC restorations in cavities with the highest C-factor.

Method. Each of the 29 patients received one or two pair(s) of Class I restorations. The first restoration was a poly-acid modified resin composite/resin composite (PMRC/RC) sandwich restoration and the second a direct RC restoration. Both restorations, except for the PMRC layer, were placed with oblique layering and two-step curing technique. Ninety restorations, 23 premolar and 67 molars, were evaluated annually with slightly modified USPHS criteria during 6 years.

Results. At 6 years, 41 pairs were evaluated. A cumulative failure rate of 2.4% was observed for both the RC and the laminate restorations. One laminate restoration showed non-acceptable color match, but was not replaced and one RC restoration showed non-acceptable marginal adaptation. Two cases of slight postoperative sensitivity were observed in one patient. Three restorations were partially replaced due to primary proximal caries.

Significance. A high durability for and no differences, were observed between both restorative techniques in Class I cavities.

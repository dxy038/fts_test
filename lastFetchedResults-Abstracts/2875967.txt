The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of different modulation schemes in aeronautical channel. In order to achieve good spectrum efficiency and system capacity, suitable modulation schemes should be selected. The aeronautical channels are affected by multipath fading and Doppler shift. Differential modulation schemes are more resistant to Doppler shift and also there is no need of carrier recovery circuit at the receiving end. The various modulation schemes like binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and differential modulation schemes like differential binary phase shift keying (DBPSK), differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) and double differential phase shift keying (DDPSK) are implemented and their performance in aeronautical channel is compared. The DDPSK can be extended to an n<sup>th</sup> order differential PSK, i.e. D<sup>n</sup>PSK. Results show that the performance in aeronautical channel can be increased by using differential modulation schemes. As a conclusion, the differential modulation schemes perform well in aeronautical channel.

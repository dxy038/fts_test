Objective
The objective of the study was to evaluate neurocognitive function in preeclampsia and normal pregnancy.
Study design
Three groups (each n = 15) were studied before and after delivery using standard neurocognitive test techniques. Group A consisted of normal laboring patients; group B, preeclamptics receiving magnesium; and group C, women in preterm labor receiving MgSO4 tocolysis (Mg control). The tests, examining attention, working memory, explicit memory, auditory comprehension, and measures for emotional distress, pain, and fatigue were analyzed via 4-way multivariate analysis of variance and multiple t tests.
Results
Preeclamptics receiving MgSO4 had better attention and working memory (P = .05), compared with normal laboring women and the preterm patients. Explicit memory was impaired in all groups, and this could not be accounted for by pain or emotional distress.
Conclusion
We could detect no cognitive defects in preeclamptics, compared with normotensive gravidas, at least while the cerebral vasodilator MgSO4 is being infused.

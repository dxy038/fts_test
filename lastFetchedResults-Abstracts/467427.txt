Objective: To enhance our understanding of the uterotonic effect of histamine, we compared the effects of histamine on spontaneous phasic and tonic contractile activity of uterine strips from term pregnant nonlaboring women. Study Design: Longitudinal uterine strips were used from the lower uterine segment of term pregnant nonlaboring women undergoing elective cesarean section. The concentration-response relationship to histamine (10–8 to 10–4 mol/L) was determined in spontaneously contracting strips or in strips contracted tonically with a protein kinase C activator (–)–indolactam V in the presence of H1 receptor antagonist (S[+]-chlorpheniramine maleate), H2 receptor antagonist (cimetidine), or solvent. Results: Histamine increased spontaneous phasic myometrial contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. H1, but not H2, receptor antagonist significantly attenuated the response to histamine. Histamine significantly reduced tonic contractions of uterine strips induced by indolactam V. H1 histamine receptor antagonist abolished relaxation, whereas H2 histamine receptor antagonist had no effect. Conclusion: Histamine increases spontaneous, but inhibits tonic, contractions of uterine strips from term pregnant nonlaboring women. Both effects are mediated through activation of H1 receptors.

Background and Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of group cognitive–behavior therapy on oppositional defiant disorder and aggression among guidance school female students. 
Subjects and Methods: The research method was semi experimental with pre-post and control group. The sample consisted of 65 female students who were selected by random cluster sampling, clinical interview with their parents and oppositional defiant behavior inventory  (ODBI). Thirty students were selected randomly and randomly divided into two groups as experimental and control. The subjects also completed Buss and Perry Inventory. Then 8 sessions of cognitive–behavior therapy was held for experimental group but the control group did not receive any intervention. For analyzing the data, MANCOVA test was used. 
Result: The results revealed that there was a significant difference between experimental and control group in oppositional defiant disorder and aggression (P < 0.001). The rate of oppositional defiant disorder and aggression in experimental group was significantly decreased in compare to pre test and control group. The results indicated that group cognitive –behavior therapy was effective to reducing the oppositional defiant disorder and aggression (P < 0.001).
Conclusions:  Group cognitive–behavior therapy can decrease the oppositional defiant disorder and aggression in guidance school female students.

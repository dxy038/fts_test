The frequency of mature hybrids, including post-F1 individuals, between loblolly (Pinus taeda L.) and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.), detectable with a codominant nuclear marker, was studied in a sympatric population from central Arkansas. The direction of introgression was also examined. The marker revealed 10 putative hybrids from the 80 trees sampled. PCR-RFLP analysis of their rbcL gene showed two of the putative hybrids (HL) share loblolly pine chloroplast DNA, and eight (HS) share the shortleaf pine chloroplast DNA. The two putative HL hybrids were morphologically similar to loblolly pine, and the eight putative HS hybrids were morphologically similar to shortleaf pine. Utilizing microsatellite data, Nei's measure of genetic identity showed the putative HL hybrids to be similar to loblolly pine, and the putative HS hybrids as being similar to shortleaf pine. An inferred tree of the individuals, using simple sequence repeat data and the neighbor-joining method, also suggested that some of the putative hybrids were not F1 individuals. Principle component analysis of the morphological characters groups the HL trees with loblolly pine and the HS trees with shortleaf pine. These results suggest bidirectional introgression occurred within the study population, and some of the putative hybrids were likely derived from early-generation backcross(es) with either shortleaf or loblolly pine.

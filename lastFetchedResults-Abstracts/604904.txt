Background and Objective: Thalassemia is an inherited disorder which is common in Iran.  Most thalassemic patients suffer from growth retardation due to economic and nutritional problems.  The majority of these patients die because of some chronic problems such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease.  Nutritional assessment and intervention are important for improving the life expectancy and quality of living in thalassemic patients.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional status and hematological indices in patients with beta thalassemia major.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 61 thalassemic patients, whom were referred to the Seyed-al-shohada Hospital in Isfahan, were enrolled.  Data on the dietary intake (micro-nutrient and macro-nutrient intake) were obtained by 24-hr Food recall and analyzed with a Food Processor software.  Demographic data were obtained by using General Questionnaires.  Statistical analyses were performed using student t-test and Pearson correlation.  
Results: Carbohydrate, protein and fat intakes were significantly lower than the standards (23.2 g, 144.6 g, and 17.4 g vs. 130 g, 49 g, and 30 g, respectively (P < 0.05).  Most of the micronutrient intakes such as vitamins A, D, and B12, and Zink and calcium were lower than references.  Some hematological indices such as hemoglobin (11.2  ±3.5, P < 0.05), hematocrit, and ferritin were significantly lower than the standards (32.5 ±8.6 and 180 ±45, P < 0.01).
Conclusions: Nutritional deficiencies were prevalent in these patients.  Therefore, it appears necessary to pay special attention to diet in thalassemic patients.

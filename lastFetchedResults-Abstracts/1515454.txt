Background: Hip fractures are serious fall injuries that often result in long-term functional impairment and increased mortality. As the population ages, the number of hip fractures is likely to increase worldwide. The main objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the risk factors of hip fracture among the older adults in the Lebanese population.
Methods: This pilot epidemiological, prospective, and case-control study was performed in 6 hospitals in Great Beirut and South Lebanon. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria filled out a questionnaire consisting on the socio- demographic characteristics, health status, drugs intake and cigarette smoking. 
Results: Overall, 195 subjects were recruited, with 65 cases of hip fracture and 130 controls all aged over 50 yr. Females represented around two third of the studied population. The logistic regression, using adjusted odds ratio (ORa), showed a significant relationship between hip fracture and chronic diseases (ORa=3.02; 95% CI: 1.63, 6.66), antihypertensive drugs intake (ORa=2.72; 95% CI: 1.56, 6.42), fall (ORa=2.79; 95% CI: 1.82, 7.06) previous fracture (ORa=3.80; 95% CI: 1.57, 9.23) and family history of fracture (ORa=4.82; 95% CI: 2.29, 10.86). Besides, smoking increased the risk of hip fracture (ORa=2.55; 95% CI: 1.96, 5.80). Having a bow was associated with the highest risk for hip fracture (ORa=5.18; 95% CI: 2.30, 12.24). 
Conclusions: Elderly people in Lebanon are exposed to many risk factors contributing to hip fracture. Our finding has implication in geriatric health improvement by preventing hip fracture in the Lebanese population.

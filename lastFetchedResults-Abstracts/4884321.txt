Summary from only given. We demonstrate a fabrication method for stacking thin film emitters and detectors directly on top of one another to realize a bidirectional, co-located emitter/detector pair for bi-directional optical communication. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the stacking of an emitter/detector pair of active components that are independently grown and optimized before integration. To fabricate the bi-directional co-located optical link, a thin film GaAs-based inverted metal-semiconductor- metal (I-MSM) photodetector (PD) and a thin film GaAs-based light emitting diode (LED) have been independently grown, fabricated into devices, and bonded onto a SiO/sub 2/ coated host substrate.

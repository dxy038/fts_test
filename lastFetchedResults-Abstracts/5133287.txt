In this paper, we address the potential issues in bidirectional motion compensated frame interpolation when the received motion vector field is directly used. Based on this motion vector analysis, we therefore propose using bidirectional motion vector processing method to eliminate the ghost artifacts around the moving objects. The artifacts caused by large motion vector magnitude can be effectively removed by correcting motion vectors bidirectionally. Moreover, since the proposed motion vector selection process chooses the best motion vector from adjacent motion vectors, the computational complexity can be greatly reduced comparing to motion estimation. We also demonstrate how to obtain clearer object edges by allowing displacement adjustment during the bidirectional motion vector processing. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of visual quality.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) addition to Tris egg yolk glycerol extender on the viability and fertility of frozen-thawed goat spermatozoa. Two experiments were conducted to determine these effects. In the first experiment, semen was collected from five fertile Damascus bucks and frozen in Tris egg yolk glycerol extender alone or with the addition of 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2% SDS. The post-thawing sperm individual motility and acrosome integrity were assessed. Both acrosome integrity and individual sperm motility were significantly (p<0.05) increased by increasing the concentration of SDS with the highest values achieved by addition of 0.1 % for individual motility (60.5±0.66) and 0.05% for acrosome integrity (72.0±1.02). However, the percentages of individual motility(48.5.±1.03) and acrosome integrity (55.0Q±1.2) were significantly (p<0.05) decreased when SDS was added by a concentration of 0.2% .In the second experiment, we investigate the effect of SDS on the fertility of frozen-thawed goat semen. Incorporation of SDS into the Tris egg yolk glycerol extender during freezing of Damascus buck semen significantly (p<0.05) improve the kidding rates than the control group with the highest rate (90%) was recorded for 0.05% SDS. In conclusion, the viability and fertility of frozen-thawed goat spermatozoa were significantly improved when sperm was frozen in Tris egg yolk glycerol extender containing SDS, especially at a concentration of 0.05%

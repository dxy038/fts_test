There are three recommendations in the geomorphological  investigations ; I , Historical suggestion ; II , Catastrophic suggestion and III ; Systemical view . The method of this article is  estimating of  energy adornment  ( Input , Output ) on the basis of cybernetics reaction interval the throughout basin on basin river . basin input including  precipitation , solar radiation , tectonic and  basin output containing  basin geomorphological land forms .  Throughout basin in basin containing subsystems. These subsystems portions are virtual subsystems and topo subsystems. The objective of this thesis is specifying the stability and equilibrated state of  basin. Since the input of basin energy is involved of positive entropy then  by virtue of this article , basin is situated in thermodynamic equilibrium and because the basin  feed back is negative  and entropy  of energy on basin is positive , then basin is situated by stability geomorphological condition .  Consequently the best land use course of basin river ( distance between planning , risk management  and critical management )  is critical management

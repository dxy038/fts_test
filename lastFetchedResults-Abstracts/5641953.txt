Based upon author proposed multichannel multidimensional optimal grid transformation technique (-Emistical dynamic mapping) and variable Emistical super high speed dynamics, this paper analyzes variable super high speed communication for reversible and bidirectional GAMA dynamic media. The speed limit E could be between slow speed to infinite squared speed, mid-ranges being high, variable, fluctuating, constant, light speed, instantaneous speed. This limit is extremely different than the previously known capacity. Furthermore, super high speed communication limit is shown to be possible by a new, proposed in this paper, dynamic equalization technique, utilizing chip resolution

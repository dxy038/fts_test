Background & Objective: Toys play an integral role in children’s developmental processes. However, using heavy metal contaminated toys can threaten the health of children. Therefore, toys quality control is considered as an important issue. The aim of this study was to examine the proportion of heavy metals including As, Pb, Cd and Cr, within the children’s plastic toys marketed in Hamedan city in 2015.
Materials & Methods: In this analytical-observational study totally, 30 samples of toys were collected from Basket market of Hamadan City. After preparation and digestion of the samples in the laboratory, the concentrations of the aforementioned heavy metals in samples were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). Also, all statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package (version 19) according to Shapiro-Wilk Test, One Sample T-Test and Independent T-Test (P <  0.05).
Results: The results showed that the maximum mean concentrations of Cr and Pb in domestic and imported plastic toys were 6.20±5.41 and 7.58±2.12 mg/kg , respectively. Also in all samples, the mean concentrations of the detected heavy metals were lower than Iranian National Standards Organization (ISI) and European Commission permissible limits. 
Conclusion: Although the results showed that the mean concentrations of metals in children’s toys were lower than ISIRI and CEN permissible limits, children’s health can be threaten by their chewing, licking and swallowing. Therefore, continuous monitoring of pollutants, particularly heavy metals, is recommended for offered toys in order to maintain the children’s health.

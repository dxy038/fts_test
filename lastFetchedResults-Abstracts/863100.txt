In this paper, the hybridization of PS (Pattern Search) method and SA (Simulated Annealing)
are incorporated in the optimization process. This is in order to look for the global
optimal solution for the fitness function and decision variables as well as minimum
computational CPU time. The real strength of SA approach has been tested in a case study
problem of industrial production planning. This is due to the great advantage of SA for
being easily escaping from trapped in local minima by accepting up-hill move through a
probabilistic procedure in the final stages of optimization process. In the Ph.D. Thesis by
Vasant (2008) [4], 16 different techniques were provided of heuristic and meta-heuristic
approaches in solving industrial production problems with nonlinear cubic objective
functions, eight decision variables and 29 constraints. In this paper, fuzzy technological
problems have been solved using hybrid techniques of pattern search and simulated
annealing (HSAPS). The simulated and computational results are compared to other various
evolutionary techniques.

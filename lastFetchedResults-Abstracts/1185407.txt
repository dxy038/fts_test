Bionic growth method, which is based on the growth mechanism of branch systems in nature, has been used as a new approach for structural topology design optimization. Currently, its application is limited because the iterative scheme in the optimization process is heuristic. This paper suggests a new approach combined with the bionic branch model and optimality criteria. Based on the Kuhnâ€“Tucker optimality condition, an analytical iterative formula is derived. The minimum compliance problem with multi-loading condition, the maximum fundamental frequency problem and the multi-objective optimization problem are studied. Typical design examples are demonstrated to validate the effectiveness of the suggested approach. Compared with the current growth technique, the suggested approach is more effective, practicable and applicable. The results show that the new bionic growth method can effectively and flexibly deal with optimum stiffener layout design of plate/shell structures to achieve various design objectives, thus it provides a new solution approach for structural topology design optimization.

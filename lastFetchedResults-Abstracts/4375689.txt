This paper deals with experimental validation of a reconfiguration strategy for sensor fault-tolerant control (FTC) in induction-motor-based electric vehicles (EVs). The proposed active FTC system is illustrated using two control techniques: indirect field-oriented control (IFOC) in the case of healthy sensors and speed control with slip regulation (SCSR) in the case of failed current sensors. The main objective behind the reconfiguration strategy is to achieve a short and smooth transition when switching from a controller using a healthy sensor to another sensorless controller in the case of a sensor failure. The proposed FTC approach performances are experimentally evaluated on a 7.5-kW induction motor drive.

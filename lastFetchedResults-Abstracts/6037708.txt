The object of this paper is to establish a useful mathematical model to predict the method which is used by Lenardo to get the roots of some special three times equation. According to the Mathematical yearbook, there exists no means to work out equations of higher degree during the year 1 AD to 1280AD. Considering the time complexity and solving feasibility with the multi-objective optimization, we compared above ways, and finally make sure that Dichotomy is the best choice for Lenardo.

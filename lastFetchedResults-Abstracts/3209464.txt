This paper concerns the Microwave Radiometer (MWR) instrument on the Aquarius/SAC-D satellite, and it discusses the development of a signal processing algorithm to infer rain rate over oceans using the measured MWR microwave brightness temperatures. On-orbit rain measurements are presented and compared with corresponding independent &#8220;surface truth&#8221; rain rates from the US Naval Research LaboratoryÂ´s WindSat satellite radiometer. Further, we discuss how the MWR rain measurements can provide a &#8220;rain flag&#8221; that can be used to improve the sea surface salinity retrieval process, which is the main objective of Aquarius/SAC-D mission.

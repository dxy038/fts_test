Object tracking is important for video analysis applications. However, tracking through occlusions is a difficult task due to significant appearance changes of the objects. Approaches based on either global features or one kind of local features can not solve the problem completely. In this paper, a multi-cue based tracking approach is introduced. It combines a corner tracking with a color and a shape model to resolve the object tracking problem through occlusions for most scenes (indoor and outdoor).To obtain an objective evaluation of the proposed method, a set of detection and tracking measures are used to perform a quantitative analysis based on a large sequence dataset with ground-truth annotation. The experimental results show that the proposed approach works robustly under varying conditions.

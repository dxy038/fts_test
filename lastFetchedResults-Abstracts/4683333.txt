A new bidirectional SSB WDM-RoF system to simultaneously transmit both 1.25 Gbps wired and 15 GHz wireless signals is proposed. For downlink, only one MZM modulating a FP-LD and multiple mode injection locking were used to serve multiple Base Stations. For uplink, remodulation technique by RSOA was used. We demonstrated this scheme by measuring BER for three channels after 23 km transmission.

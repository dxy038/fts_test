In this paper, Yet Another Many-Objective Clustering (YAMO-Pack) is proposed for academic field programmable gate array architecture model. The YAMO-Pack introduces the impact of attraction between Basic Logic Elements (BLE) and the selected Configurable Logic Blocks (CLB) when BLEs are indirectly connected to the CLBs. Consequently more external nets are absorbed into clusters and speed of the design is improved. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous approaches in terms of number of CLBs, number of external nets and critical path.

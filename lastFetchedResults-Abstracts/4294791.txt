A display is an electronic component or subsystem used to convert electrical signals into visual imagery in real time suitable for direct interpretation by a human observer. It has been determined that alternatives to CRT displays need to found. One of the alternatives was the introduction of flat panel displays (FPD). A flat panel display is often defined in terms of the ideal display, that being: thin form, low volume, even surface, having high resolution, high contrast, sunlight readable, color, low power, and being solid-state and light weight. The objective is to develop displays with as many desirable characteristics as possible. Amongst the FPDs discussed are: liquid crystal displays (LCD), light emitting diodes (LED), electroluminescent displays, field emission displays, digital micromirror devices, plasma displays, vacuum fluorescent displays, electrochromic and electrophoretic displays and ferroelectric displays. Air Force and defense requirements on the FPDs are discussed

A new interactive computer software package for eigenvalue/eigenvector assignment using constant state feedback is described. The packge consists of ten subprograms, each associated with a specific design objective, accessible from a main control program. Using this package, primary design objectives of assigning eigenvalues and approximating eigenvectors are first achieved. Then secondary design objectives, including modification of specific eigenvector components, reduction in specified elements of the feedback gain matrix, and reduction in eigensystem sensitivity to changes in plant parameters, are addressed. These secondary objectives are achieved by a systematic modification of the assigned eigenvectors in a small region about the initial assignment. In addition, the program implements the use of spectral assignment procedures with reduced-order system models. Program modes are described and illustrated by numerical examples.

The objective of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) edge detection is the identification of contours across the investigated scene, exploiting SAR complex data. Edge detectors available in the literature exploit singularly amplitude and interferometric phase information, looking for reflectivity or height difference between neighboring pixels, respectively. Recently, more performing detectors based on the joint processing of amplitude and interferometric phase data have been presented. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the exploitation of real and imaginary parts of single-look complex acquired data. The technique is developed in the framework of stochastic estimation theory, exploiting Markov random fields. Compared to available edge detectors, the technique proposed in this paper shows useful advantages in terms of model complexity, phase artifact robustness, and scenario applicability. Experimental results on both simulated and real TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed data show the interesting performances and the overall effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this work we report on a new approach for such optical fiber tweezers in which microprisms acting as beam deflectors are fabricated on the fiber-bundle end-face by a two-photon lithography (TPL) technique. In TPL the output beam of a 100-fs pulsewidth, 80-MHz Ti:sapphire laser oscillator is focused through a dry semi-apochromatic microscope objective (NA = 0.70) inside a suitable resin that is deposited on fiber bundle end-face. The resin polymerizes through Two Photon Absorption (TPA) only in the focal volume. Combined with a computer-controlled piezoelectric positioning system, this approach provides the capability of writing, point-by-point, arbitrary 3D patterns within the resin volume. The resin that is not polymerized can be easily removed through a proper solvent.

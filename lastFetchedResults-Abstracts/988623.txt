This paper explores the optimization of an ice-storage air conditioning system in consideration of both minimal life-cycle cost and efficiency of ice-storage tank. Such air-conditioning system consists primarily of ice-storage tank, screw-type chiller and auxiliary equipment. Optimization is carried out using dynamic programming algorithm, where the power consumption models of the chiller and its auxiliary equipment as well as the heat transport in ice-storage tank are established based on manufacturer's data. Initial cost and operation cost are objective functions, and the performance of chiller and ice-storage tanks are constraints. Through simulation analysis using numerical program, system optimization and analysis are carried out to obtain optimum chiller and ice-storage tank capacity. Finally, results are used to probe some design guidelines regarding life-cycle cost and payback period under chiller priority and ice priority control strategies.

Integration and application of technical and (bio)medical knowledge in the complex area of biomedical engineering is a matter of teamwork. In our educational BME program special attention is focussed on this issue, by means of multidisciplinary projects (MDP´s) for 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> year students. The overall objective and learning targets of MDP´s are presented. So far, evaluation of the projects has shown that students as well as staff are generally very enthusiastic about this special kind of Design Centred Learning.

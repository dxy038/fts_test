Background: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading global cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Radiotherapy plays a signifcant role in treatment of breast cancer and reduces locoregional recurrence and
eventually improves survival. The treatment felds applied for breast cancer treatment
include: tangential, axillary, supraclavicular and internal mammary felds.
Objective: In the present study, due to the presence of sensitive organ such as
thyroid inside the supraclavicular feld, thyroid dose and its effective factors were investigated.
Materials and Methods: Thyroid dose of 31 female patients of breast cancer
with involved supraclavicular lymph nodes which had undergone radiotherapy were
measured. For each patient, three TLD-100 chips were placed on their thyroid gland
surface, and thyroid doses of patients were measured. The variables of the study include shield shape, the time of patient’s setup, the technologists’ experience and qualifcation. Finally, the results were analyzed by ANOVA test using SPSS 11.5 software.
Results: The average age of the patients was 46±10 years. The average of thyroid
dose of the patients was 140±45 mGy (ranged 288.2 and 80.8) in single fraction. There
was a signifcant relationship between the thyroid dose and shield shape. There was
also a signifcant relationship between the thyroid dose and the patient’s setup time.
Conclusion: Beside organ at risk such as thyroid which is in the supraclavicular
feld, thyroid dose possibility should be reduced. For solving this problem, an appropriate shield shape, the appropriate time of the patient’s setup, etc. could be considered.

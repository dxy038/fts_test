This paper presents the results achieved by applying Reliability, Availability, Maintainability (RAM) techniques to communication systems over the period 1968-1972. The objective of this program was to guide development of Ground Communication systems and evaluation after deployment. These systems, after field deployment, went through the normal debugging activity. By detection and proper recognition of potential problem areas, corrective action was taken to achieve the most needed improvements for least cost. The US Army Satellite Communications Agency (USASATCOMA) is the ArmyÂ´s focal point for a whole class of materials that are related to satellite communications. Once developed, these equipments become a part of a larger entity that must itself undergo a degree of development and testing prior to operational use as a DOD Joint Service System. The performance of the communication ground subsystem was assessed as part of the larger system, and ground subsystem availability was evaluated. The USASAT-COMA received field data from 14 AN/MSC-46 terminals and 12 AN/TSC-54 terminals over this period. The reporting system was jointly developed to get field data for these assessments. A prime consideration in gathering data was to keep the reporting system simple so that field personnel would be required only to perform minimum clerical work and make minimum interpretations of data. This paper considers the design objectives of both the AN/MSC-46 and the AN/MSC-46 and the AN/TSC-54 ground terminals and the assessment and growth of these systems in availability achievement after being deployed.

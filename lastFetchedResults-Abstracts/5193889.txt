In this paper, the quantitative evaluation model-attribute recognition model is used to identify underground spacepsilas air quality. Three types of method are applicated to empower the objective weights, which avoid determining the weights subjectively. In the light of actual description of the process, the ultimately evaluation of underground spacepsilas air quality is fit for the result of reality.

Nowadays, in order to reach minimum production cost in manufacturing operations, specially machining operations, various optimization methods have been proposed. Since turning operation has different parameters affecting the workpiece quality, it is selected as a complicated manufacturing method in this paper. To reach sufficient quality, all influencing parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut, are selected as input parameters. Furthermore, the surface roughness is considered as objective. To reach this goal, we first calculate the degree of freedom for the system and perform same experiments based on the target values, number of considered levels, and corresponding orthogonal array and then calculate the grey relational generating, grey relational coefficient, and grey relational grade. As the next step, the grey relational graph for each level is sketched. Finally, the optimum values of the input parameters for better surface roughness are obtained. It is shown that the presented method in the turning operation of AISI 4340 leads to high surface quality.

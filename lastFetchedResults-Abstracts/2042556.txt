Conventional and ultrasound-assisted hydrolysis and subsequent esterification of Nagchampa oil under mild operating conditions have been investigated with an objective of intensification of methyl esters production using a sustainable approach. The effect of ratio of reactants, temperature, enzyme loading, pretreatment of enzyme (using ultrasonic irradiations) on the hydrolysis and esterification reaction has been studied. Optimum conditions for hydrolysis were observed to be 1:1 weight ratio of oil: water for Lip Z and 1:3 for Lip 2 enzymes, enzyme loading of 400 units for Lip Z and 800 mg for Lip 2 enzymes and reaction time of 6 h. In the case of esterification reaction, optimum conditions obtained were oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:2, enzyme loading of 1000 mg and reaction time of 20 h. Use of pretreated enzyme (using ultrasonic irradiations) was found to increase the extent of esterification reaction from 75% to 92.5%. It was observed that use of ultrasound in the reaction significantly intensified the esterification reaction with time requirement reducing from 20 h for conventional stirring based approach to only about 7.5 h in the presence of ultrasound. The extent of esterification obtained with sonicated enzyme also increased to 96% from 75% with unsonicated enzyme.

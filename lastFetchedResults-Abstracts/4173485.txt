A content-aware video retargeting method is proposed for playing broadcast soccer video in small displays. Four visual perception clues are predefined based on soccer game-specific knowledge and modelled by visual attention features firstly. Then, a fuzzy logic inference system is proposed to estimate visual attention values (AVs) of ball and players by fusing attention features. AVs are later used to determine the region of interest (ROI) of each frame. Finally, a retargeted video is generated by the ROI of each frame with polynomial curve fitting for temporal smoothing. Both subjective and objective evaluation results are promising.

The main aim of the paper is to reduce the real power losses and improve the voltage profile in a radial distribution feeder by placement of capacitor allocation taking voltage as a constraint. Fuzzy expert system decides the nodes where the capacitor must be placed in order to compensate both real power loss and improve voltage profile. Then the sizing of the capacitors is modeled by the objective function to obtain maximum savings using Particle Swarm Optimization and Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization and is compared. A case study with an existing rural 15 bus distribution feeder is presented to illustrate the applicability of the algorithm.

The main objective of this study is to dilate the pharynx by selective activation of the lingual musculature through electrical stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve. A flat-interface-nerve-electrode (FINE) with nine contacts was implanted on the proximal hypoglossal nerve trunk in a dog. The evoked electromyogram signals were recorded with wire electrodes from the genioglossus, geniohyoid, styloglossus, and hyoglossus muscles. Genioglossus or geniohyoid was activated selectively without significant activation of other muscles within a window of the stimulus current. A FINE design with a smaller inter-contact distance may be needed to selectively activate the remaining two extrinsic tongue muscles also,

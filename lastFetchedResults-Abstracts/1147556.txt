The main purpose of this descriptive-correlational research was to study the relationship of self-efficacy and organizational commitment of faculty members to their teaching quality. The target population included 2181 faculty members of branches of Islamic Azad University in zone one. A sample of 436 respondents was selected through stratified-cluster sampling method. Research instruments included a researcher-made questionnaire of teaching quality with 27 Liker-scale statements and Cronbach’s alpha of 0.861,  Allen and Meyer’s questionnaire of organizational commitment, and Schwartzer et al. questionnaire of teachers’ self-efficacy.  A use was made of multiple regression and structural equation modeling to examine the effect of exogenous factors on teaching quality. One-way ANOVA was also run to analyze the role of faculty members’ demographic variables. The results revealed that self-efficacy (with an index of 0.42) and organizational commitment (with an index of 0.22) had a positive, direct, and significant relationship with teaching quality. From among the dimensions of organizational commitment, emotional commitment and continuous commitment could strongly predict the variance of teaching quality. In addition, self-efficacy and organizational commitment had a significant bidirectional effect on each other. Demographic variables were found to have no significant effect on self-efficacy and organizational commitment of the faculty members.

In this study, a substantial idea has been reviewed which is useful in the investigation of the planning uncertainties. The concept relies on the optimality of an expansion plan in different conditions rather than the condition it has been optimised for. The method is developed in a manner that can be used in all sub-systems (i.e. generation, transmission and distribution) expansion planning. However, in this study the idea has been assessed for generation expansion planning (GEP). Cost and reliability have been considered as two major objectives of the planning and robustness has been added as a supplementary objective. The method can deal with uncertainty in both coefficients of the objective functions and the constraints. Two GEP models, one static and the other dynamic, have been proposed to examine the performance of the method in the uncertainty handling. In addition, the efficiency of the TaguchiÂ´s orthogonal array testing method has been compared with Monte Carlo simulation in the scenario generation. Two case studies have been provided to simplify the justification on the efficiency of the method.

A single part type, single machine, fluid model manufacturing system is considered. The machine is subject to a deterministic deterioration process, which depends on the operation rate. The objective is to minimize a long term average cost index which penalizes inventory surplus and backlog. The optimal policy determined presents some similarities with the policy conjectured optimal in the past for a similar Markovian formulation. The considered problem can be applied to several real contexts, and not just from the manufacturing domain, as briefly discussed in the paper.

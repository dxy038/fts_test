New Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions for e-Health are increasingly being implemented and deployed. Many studies associated with this venture usually include market research, usability studies, and testing. However one of the more important aspects which is often overlooked but directly affects the sustainability of the new technology is the management of the change process. This paper presents some guidelines grounded in the social sciences that could foster the success of implementing new ICT initiatives in e-Health. A case study is presented on the introduction of a mobile health care management system called myDR (my Daily Record). The objective of the research is to highlight the importance of the change management process and the role it plays in the deployment of new health care initiatives. The case study indicates that people are more inclined to use the new system if the proper change management mechanisms are in place.

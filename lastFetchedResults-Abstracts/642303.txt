Objective
We investigated whether food variety and diversity are associated withphysical and cognitive functioning in older adults in Botswana anddesigned a simple set of screening questions that predict food varietyin this population.
Methods

Datawere collected (1998) as a national household survey of 1085 subjects60 y and older. A food variety score, based on a foodfrequency checklist, was calculated by summing the frequency of weeklyintakes of 16 food items (0 to 66). A dietary diversity score wascalculated as the number of food groups consumed weekly (0 to 5). Arepresentative subsample (n = 393) wasrandomly selected for the clinical component of the survey, andmeasurements on dependency and cognitive function wereconducted.
Results

Low food variety was found: 35.2%, 59.3%, and 22.4% ofsubjects consumed no dairy products, fruits, and vegetables,respectively. A higher food variety score was associated with urbanresidence, ownership of cattle, higher education, and more frequentmeals, and these indicators were used to construct a nutritional riskindicator. Higher food variety score was associated with betterself-reported health and better cognitive function. Similarly, a higherscore on the nutritional risk indicator screening tool was associatedwith desirable healthoutcomes.
Conclusion

A limited number of foods is consumed, leading to an overall pattern ofpoor food variety. Higher food variety was associated with improvedphysical and cognitive functions. A screening tool that predicts foodvariety in this population has been developed and is recommended to beincorporated at a primary care level to identify older adults most atrisk of a poor qualitydiet.

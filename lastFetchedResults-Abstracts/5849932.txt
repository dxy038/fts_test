Random polygon Generation from a given set of points is very important for different applications. A heuristic termed as &#8220;GRP_AS&#8221; has been proposed here to generate a random simple polygon from a given set of `nÂ´ points in 2-Dimensional plane. The &#8220;2-Opt Move&#8221; heuristic with time complexity O(n<sup>4</sup>) is the best known among the existing heuristics to generate a simple polygon. We recently designed another heuristic &#8220;GRP_CH&#8221; for the same problem with time complexity O(n<sup>3</sup>) which was shown to be better than that of &#8220;2-Opt Move&#8221; heuristic in terms of random behaviour and time complexity. In this work, our main objective is to design an algorithm with reduced time complexity. The proposed heuristic, &#8220;GRP_AS&#8221; is based on the principle of random selection of a line segment and angular sorting of the point set. This &#8220;GRP_AS&#8221; heuristic takes O(nlogn) time which is less than that of &#8220;2-Opt Move&#8221; heuristic as well as &#8220;GRP_CH&#8221; heuristic. The lower bound and upper bound on the number of polygons generated in &#8220;GRP_AS&#8221; heuristic has been computed.

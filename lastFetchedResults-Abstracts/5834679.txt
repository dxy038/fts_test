This paper presents a lamp voltage inversion methodology and output capacitor analysis applied to a bidirectional flyback converter. The converter integrates the power control and the inversion stage, feeding a HPS lamp with a low frequency symmetrical square waveform, avoiding the acoustic resonance phenomenon occurrence. A detailed design of the lamp parallel capacitor is developed with parameters of stability, lamp power high frequency ripple and the lamp voltage inversion time to avoid lamp re-ignition. Experimental results are presented to validate the proposed topology.

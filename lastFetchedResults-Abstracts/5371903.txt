Distributed generation (DG) allocation problem is addressed utilizing fuzzy multi-objective optimization in this paper. It is shown that the methodology provides needed consideration for DG allocation and accounts for uncertainty using fuzzy set theory. Voltage drop reduction, short circuit capacity (SCC) augmentation, decrease operation cost and system losses reduction were considered as objectives for formulating fuzzy optimization. The paper discusses in detail the approach adopted and several numerical examples are presented to test the developed methodology.

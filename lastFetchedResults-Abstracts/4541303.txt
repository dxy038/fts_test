The larger objective for this contest is to be a showcase of advances in co-design tools and methodologies, in combination with design ingenuity and creativity. In the second installment of the contest, we received 9 submissions. In this short writeup, we review this yearÂ´s design problem, and we consider relevant contest statistics.

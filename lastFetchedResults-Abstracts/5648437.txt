Due to the nonlinearity of IMs (Induction Motors), design optimization of these motors, using simple optimization methods, are not applicable, and modified methods are necessary. IMs have many different characteristics that must be optimized. In this paper, multi-objective design optimization of IM reduced to a new objective function that can be optimized simply using FE (Finite Element) and a simple weighted optimization method. IM characteristics are depending on many parameters such as losses and production cost. Variation of each parameter can affect the IM characteristics. So suitable weights apply to these parameters and using an appropriate objective function, an optimized motor is designed. Outputs of design optimization compare with a real motor (General Electric Co. motor) characteristics.

Microprocessors impact many applications as they replace logic in products, act as intelligent controllers, and even carry out functions sometimes done by minicomputer systems. There is a great deal of variability among the LSI chips, microprogrammability, instruction sets, speed, their own needs and it is necessary to match the microprocessor to the application The objective of this paper is to interpret application needs in terms of microprocessor architecture and describe some the tradeoffs available.

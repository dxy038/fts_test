Muscle force generating capability depends on muscle geometry which may be altered with post-stroke hemiparesis. The objective of this study was to assess the differences in physiological cross-sectional areas and muscle lengths of quadriceps between the paretic and non-paretic sides of post-stroke subjects and subjects unaffected by stroke.

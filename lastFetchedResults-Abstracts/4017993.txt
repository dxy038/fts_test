A novel, efficient white balancing technique is presented for images illuminated by multiple light sources. The existing portable two-dimensional grey reference colour chart has been replaced by a portable three-dimensional (3D) grey sphere to deal with multiple illuminant sources in the 3D real world. Experiments indicate that the proposed solution provides significantly better white balance results in the sense of both objective error measure and subjective visual quality.

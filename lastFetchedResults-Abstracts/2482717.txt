Objective: Bone marrow (BM) is one of the major hematopoietic organs in postnatal life that
consists of a heterogeneous population of stem cells which have been previously described.
Recently, a rare population of stem cells that are called very small embryonic-like (VSEL) stem
cells has been found in the BM. These cells express several developmental markers of pluripotent
stem cells and can be mobilized into peripheral blood (PB) in response to tissue injury.
In this study we have attempted to investigate the ability of these cells to migrate toward an
injured spinal cord after transplantation through the tail vein in a rat model.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, VSELs were isolated from total BM
cells using a fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) system and sca1 and stage specific
embryonic antigen (SSEA-1) antibodies. After isolation, VSELs were cultured for 7 days
on C2C12 as the feeder layer. Then, VSELs were labeled with 1,1´-dioctadecyl-3,3,3´,3´-
tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) and transplanted into the rat spinal cord
injury (SCI) model via the tail vein. Finally, we sought to determine the presence of VSELs
in the lesion site.
Results: We isolated a high number of VSELs from the BM. After cultivation, the VSELs
colonies were positive for SSEA-1, Oct4 and Sca1. At one month after transplantation,
real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed a significantly increased expression
level of Oct4 and SSEA-1 positive cells at the injury site.
Conclusion: VSELs have the capability to migrate and localize in an injured spinal
cord after transplantation.

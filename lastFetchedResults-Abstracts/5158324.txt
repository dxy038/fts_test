Basically, the scholars in China did not do in-depth research on retail theory, therefore no unique retail theory forms in China in the process. The development of western retail business is earlier than that in China, and the study of retail development theory in the West is more mature than that in our country. This paper analyzes defects of the theory of foreign retail format evolution law on the basis of generalizing the theoretical study, hoping to reveal the objective basis of the retail formats´ evolution and look into the development trend of the future research in theory.

As Crash Imminent Braking (CIB) systems have been introduced to the passenger vehicle market segment, there is an immediate need to develop a standardized performance scoring system which enables an objective comparison of similar CIB systems implemented across various vehicle platforms. It is desirable that this standard is adopted by the entire automotive industry to further advance CIB technologies. It is also a valuable reference for consumers to compare the safety of different vehicles. This paper describes an approach for the establishment of such a standard to evaluate and compare the performance of CIB systems. A set of testing scenarios is proposed for the performance evaluation of CIB systems. Subjective and arguable test scenarios are avoided as much as possible. The applicability of the proposed scoring system is demonstrated with the data collected from some proposed testing scenarios in the evaluation of a 2011 model-year passenger vehicle equipped with a CIB system.

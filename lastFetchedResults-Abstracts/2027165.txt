The Baluarte do Cavaleiro is part of the stone masonry wall system existing in the city of Chaves of Portugal and it is a construction dated from the XVII century. The Baluarte do Cavaleiro is formed by three walls (North-East, NE; South-East, SE; South-West, SW) and by two junction elements (designated here by cunhais). The SE wall has suffered two collapses recently. The main objective of this research work is to describe the monitoring process adopted to control the stability of the Baluarte do Cavaleiro and the adjacent constructions that could be affected during the last rebuilding process of this wall. Taking into account that this rebuilding process included the total removal of this wall, it was also possible to identify the real geometry of the cross section of the wall, its building solution and the type of the sustained soil. It was also possible to contribute for a better understanding of the structural behaviour of this kind of stone masonry construction.

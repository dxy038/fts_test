In LTE systems, low-power required small-coverage-cell is additionally deployed on a macro-cell to enhance the system performance in the respects of coverage and capacity improvement. In this paper, we propose a self-optimization algorithm for a single femto-cell coverage. The objective function to be minimized for optimal coverage adjustment is the sum of camp on (CO) and unnecessary hand over (UHO) areas that is defined shortly. CO problem results in inefficient usage of base station with low received signal strength, and consequently, causes the low data rate. UHO incurs the wasteful usage of limited resources and overhead increase due to HO processes. We verify the validity of the proposed algorithm by comparing the performance with the result of theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we develop the proposed algorithm to increase the system throughput.

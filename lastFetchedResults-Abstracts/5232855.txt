The polarized bidirectional reflectance distribution function is measured for a Spectralon calibration target using an automated, broadband, polarized, optical goniometer. Measurements are acquired for illumination angles of 0, -20, -30, -40 -50, and -60 degrees as a function of receiver view angle. Both like- and cross-polarized components are measured for horizontally polarized incident illumination. The Spectralon target exhibits stronger specular behavior than expected where the ratio of the cross-polarized to like-polarized component in the specular direction varies from 0.67 to 0.1 for 0 and -60 degrees incidence respectively

In this paper, we consider the axisymmetric problem of a frictionless receding contact between an elastic functionally graded layer and a homogeneous half-space, when the two bodies are pressed together. The graded layer is modeled as a nonhomogeneous medium with an isotropic stressâ€“strain law and is subjected over a part of its top surface to normal tractions while the rest of it is free of tractions. Since the contact between the two bodies is assumed to be frictionless, then only compressive normal tractions can be transmitted in the contact area. Using Hankel transform, the axisymmetric elasticity equations are converted analytically into a singular integral equation in which the unknowns are the contact pressure and the receding contact radius. The global equilibrium condition of the layer is supplemented to solve the problem. The singular integral equation is solved numerically using orthogonal Chebychev polynomials and an iterative scheme is employed to obtain the correct receding contact length that satisfies the global equilibrium condition. The main objective of the paper is to study the effect of the material nonhomogeneity parameter and the thickness of the graded layer on the contact pressure and on the length of the receding contact.

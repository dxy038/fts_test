The objective of this session is to promote the concept that an integrated approach is required for modern advanced control system design. By presenting sufficiently rich examples, we hope to bring the control theorists and practitioners together to assess the status of modern control applications to physical systems, to envision the trend of future development of control science, and most of all, to foster the cooperation between the theorists and practitioners in the control community. This paper presents an introduction to other papers on advanced control system design. The topics to be covered include robust nonlinear servomechanism theory, control of nonlinear flexible pointing systems, noninteracting control and maneuvering of articulated robots, structural vibration suppression using fuzzy logic control, and missile autopilot design using dynamic inversion and structured singular value synthesis, and the integration of these subjects

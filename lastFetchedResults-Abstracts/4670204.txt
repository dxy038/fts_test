The integration of Paraguana&#769; wind farm imposes several challenges on the operation and control of Paraguana&#769; transmission system. An assessment of the power system variability is imperative for the planning of the essential system reinforcements. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the variability of power flows on the Paraguana&#769; transmission system due to the integration of the new 100MW Paraguana&#769; wind farm. Stochastic power flow based on Monte Carlo simulations is employed to assess the variability. The stochastic system model created is based on real measurements of the loads and local generation in the Paraguana&#769; transmission system and real wind speed data. Simulation results have demonstrated that the integration of this wind farm leads to an increase in the variability of the power flows in the system lines and to an increase in the probability of reserve power flows.

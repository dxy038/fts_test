The main objective of this research was to investigate the addition of waste-brick material in brick production. The effects of recycling of waste brick material on the durability and mechanical properties of the bricks were analysed. Fired waste bricks cause considerable harm to the environment. During production, especially in the firing, transportation and construction procedures, large amounts of bricks are broken and have to be dumped in landfills or used as a filling material. For this purpose, the chemical and mineralogical structures of waste bricks from the  orum region in West-Anatolia, Turkey, were investigated. After pulverizing, the samples were divided into two categories: A passing through a 4.75 mm sieve (coarse) and B passing a 600 μm sieve (fine). In order to obtain comparable test results, ratios of the waste (0, 10, 20 and 30% by mass) were added to the raw-brick clay. Standard test methods were used to determine the mechanical properties of the bricks at different firing temperatures. The results show that at a mass of 30% fine-waste material additive, fired at 900°C, the test sample has an adequate strength. The reuse of this material in the industry would contribute to the protection of farmland and the environment.

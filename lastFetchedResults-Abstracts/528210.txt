Wheat production with the least use of chemical inputs is an important goal of modern farming to decrease of negative effects of the use of chemical inputs. This paper has estimated the virtual profit of organic wheat in transition period using a cross sectional data of 453 wheat producers of Khorasan Razavi province during 2007. A model introduced to this objective so that it has ability of estimation the virtual yield, revenues, costs and profit of organic wheat based on traditional wheat input-output data. Results of study showed that yield loss of organic wheat compensate in extremely six years. It can consider transition period from one to six year based on price of organic wheat but compensation of reducing farmer's revenue is easier and price pressure on consumer level is lower in six years transition period. Based on the results of the present study, using of introduced model structure is recommended in order to estimate the virtual profit of agricultural organic products

Prisoners are highly susceptible to tuberculosis (TB). This survey aimed at evaluating the status of TB at Evin and Qasr prisons in Tehran, Iran from 1998 to 1999. In this descriptive study, the target population was interviewed and subjected to physical examination, chest X-ray (CXR) and sputum examination to screen for the presence of pulmonary tuberculosis or other types of TB. A total of 6679 prisoners were examined, of whom 4,479 were from Evin and 2,200 from Qasr prisons. Male to female ratio was 4:5 and 1.1 in Qasr prison and Evin prison respectively. Out of the 4479 prisoners at Evin prison, 15 were diagnosed with pulmonary TB, among the latter group, one case was a new sputum-positive male. In Qasr prison out of the 2200 prisoners, 15 cases were diagnosed with pulmonary TB among them, we found 5 new cases with sputum-positivity. From 520 CXRs, 5% were compatible with TB. The prevalence of pulmonary TB in the general population during the year 1999 was 13.2 per 100,000 and for new smear-positive TB this ratio was 8.73 per 100,000. The period prevalence for smear-positive TB was 13.4 per 100,000 at Evin prison and 678 per 100,000 at Qasr prison, which were 25.3 and 51.6 times more than the general population, respectively. Special attention to the prevention and treatment of TB in prisons is strongly recommended.

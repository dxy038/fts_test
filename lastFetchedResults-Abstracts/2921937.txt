JET is the largest project in the Euratom fusion research programme. Its objective is to obtain and study plasmas with parameters and dimensions approaching those needed in a fusion reactor. However, to obtain the temperatures required for a reactor heating by a current is insufficient and so JET is equipped with two additional forms of heating, namely neutral beam heating and radio frequency heating. The author describes these two forms of heating

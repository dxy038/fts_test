Objective(s):Atherosclerosis is chronic inflammatory process triggered by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can increase hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)level, which induce atherosclerosis through the processes such as formation of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), foam cells, and atherosclerotic plaque. Antioxidant is needed to control negative effects of oxidative stress. One source of antioxidant, which has potential to be developed, is PsP from Ganoderma lucidum. This study aims to prove the effect of PsP in decreasing H2O2, PVAT, foam cells and atherosclerotic plaque. Materials and Methods: This study was experimental randomized post-test with control group design using 25 Rattus norvegicus Wistar strain rats. Rats were divided into 5 groups (negative control, positive control, and 3 high-fat diet group with PsP dose: 50, 150, 300 mg/kgBW). Measured parameters were H2O2, PVAT, foam cell, and atherosclerotic plaques. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical analysis, followed by post hoc test. Results: Mean H2O2 levels, PVAT thickness, foam cell numbers, and atherosclerotic plaque were low in negative control group. ANOVA showed that PsP significantly (P<0.05) reduced H2O2 levels, PVAT thickness, foam cells numbers and atherosclerotic plaque width. Conclusion: PsP dose of 300 mg/kgBW has the most significant effect in decreasing H2O2 levels, PVAT thickness, number of foam cells, and atherosclerotic plaque width. Based on the results of this research, PsP can be recommended as antioxidant to control pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency at which laparoscopic surgery is performed to treat female pelvic pain.
Study design
Using the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery, we performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study of women who had been diagnosed with abdominal or pelvic pain who underwent outpatient laparoscopic procedures. Rates of procedures were tabulated for all years that were available (1994-1996). A comparison was made across age, ethnicity, and geographic distribution.
Results
The estimated number of women who underwent outpatient laparoscopic surgery for pelvic/abdominal pain was 120,000, 130,400, and 128,600 for the years 1994 through 1996, respectively. Typical additional procedures that were performed included lysis of adhesions, dilation, and hysteroscopy. The women who underwent these procedures were generally of reproductive age (mean, 32.2 Â± 9.6 years old). Most procedures are performed in hospitals with the use of general anesthesia. The southern portion of the country contributes a disproportionate share of the reported procedures.
Conclusion
Laparoscopic surgical evaluation of female pelvic or abdominal pain occurs frequently in the US health care system.

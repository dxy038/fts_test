The Loess Plateau in northwest China is one of the most eroded landscapes in the world, and it is urgent that alternative practices be evaluated to control soil erosion. Our objective was to determine how three different tillage practices for monoculture of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) affected soil organic carbon (SOC) and N content after 11 years. Conventional tillage with residue removal (CT), shallow tillage with residue cover (ST), and no-tillage with residue cover (NT) were investigated. Carbon and N in various aggregate-size classes and various labile organic C fractions in the 0–15- and 15–30-cm soil layers were evaluated. The ST and NT treatments had 14.2 and 13.7% higher SOC stocks and 14.1 and 3.7% higher total N (Nt) stocks than CT in the upper 15 cm, respectively. Labile C fractions: particulate organic C (POC), permanganate oxidizable C (KMnO4-C), hot-water extractable C (HWC), microbial biomass C (MBC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) were all significantly higher in NT and ST than in CT in the upper 15 cm. KMnO4-C, POC and HWC were the most sensitive fractions to tillage changes. The portion of 0.25–2 mm aggregates, mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) of aggregates from ST and NT treatments were larger than from CT at both 0–15- and 15–30-cm soil depths. The ST and NT treatments had significantly higher SOC and Nt in the 0.25–2 mm fraction at both depths and significantly higher Nt content in the upper 15 cm. Positive significant correlations were observed between SOC, labile organic C fractions, MWD, GMD, and macroaggregate (0.25–2 mm) C within the upper 15 cm. We conclude that both variants of conservation tillage (NT and ST) increase SOC stock in the rainfed farming areas of northern China and are therefore more sustainable practices than those currently being used.

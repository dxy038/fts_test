The concept of using two or more conductors per phase for extra high voltage power lines was mainly introduced to control radio interference and audible noise levels by reducing the magnitude of the electric fields appearing at the surface of the conductors. The number of conductors in the bundle is usually selected as the minimum needed to achieve the above objective. This is done because the cost of building the power line itself increases when the number of conductors in the bundle is increased. This study, on the other hand, shows that the total cost to the utility is lower when the number of conductors in the bundle is increased. The key in the analysis is to take into consideration the power transfer capability of the line and the amount of the required series and shunt compensation. The study shows that other nonmonetary benefits also accrue when the number of conductors in the bundle is increased

In this paper, integrated preventive maintenance planning and production scheduling for a single machine is formulated as a multi-objective mathematical optimization problem. Despite the inter-dependent relationship between them, production scheduling and preventive maintenance planning decisions are generally analyzed and executed independently in real manufacturing systems. This practice is also found in the majority of the studies found in the relevant literature. The chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the integrated optimization model for production scheduling and preventive maintenance planning. The numerical results on several problem sizes indicate that the methodologyÂ´s feasibility and efficiency

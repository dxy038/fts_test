Essentials of power system dynamic behavior, the character and difference index of disturbed trajectories are summed up in this paper. The model verification and parameter identification methods based on difference index of disturbed trajectories are reviewed, as well as the existed problems and possible development. The index should not be based on conventional signal processing technologies only; however it should reflect the physical mechanisms of the system dynamics. It is revealed that there exist multi-solution phenomena in multi-parameter identification, thus the identification results depend on both initial value and search strategy. This problem might be solved with applying multiple sets of measured response curves as benchmarks in different scenarios, and the objective parameters should remain unchanged during getting these benchmark curves.

Objective: Based on Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, it has been reported that most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients suffer from various degrees of sleep problems. Sleep disorders can affect quality of life, physical and social functioning and can also cause chronic fatigue. Some psychological and physiological factors are related to sleep quality. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate sleep quality and its related psychological and physiological factors in Iranian human immunodeficiency virus positive patients who were candidates for initiation of antiretroviral therapy. 
Method: This was a cross- sectional study of 59 HIV positive out-patients in stages 2 or 3 of HIV disease who were candidates for initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Somatization Subscale of Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were used to assess the patientsâ€™ sleep quality, depression, anxiety and physiological factors, respectively. SPSS software version 12 was used for data analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficient was utilized to analyze the correlation between PSQI and other quantitative variables.
Results: Based on the sleep quality assessment, 47.5 % of the patients had PSQI  >  5 that was defined as sleep disturbances. A significant correlation was found between sleep quality and HDRS (r = 0.531, p = 0.0001), HARS (r = 0.627, p = 0.0001) and somatization subscale of SCL-90 (r = 0.36, p = 0.05).
Conclusion: This study showed that human immunodeficiency virus positive individuals suffer from sleep disorders at least as same as the general population, and that psychological variables including depression and anxiety and physiological variables including physical morbidities in different systems of the body lead to sleep disturbance in this population.

Manga is a five Nation (Germany, France, Italy, Sweden and United Kingdom) joint project realized by the European Defence Agency (EDA) which focuses on SiC substrates and a GaN epi wafers supply chain. The main objective of the project, started in March 2010, is to sustain the industrial development of semi-insulating silicon carbide substrates (SI SiC) and prove the industrial capability of Europe to deliver GaN HEMT and MMIC foundries with state-of-the-art GaN HEMT epitaxial wafers on SI-SiC substrates. This paper gives an overview on the current status of the technical developments achieved within the project.

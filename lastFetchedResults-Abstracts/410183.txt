Background/Aims: The effect of interferon on the reduction of liver fibrosis is controversial. We aimed to compare semiquantitative methods with a quantitative digital image analysis system to assess liver fibrosis in biopsies from patients with chronic hepatitis and different responses to interferon.
Methods: We studied 98 liver biopsies with chronic hepatitis C before and after recombinant interferon alfa-2 treatment, using conventional histological assessment, grading of histological activity, scoring/staging of fibrosis (Knodell and Scheuer), and quantification of fibrosis with image analysis (FibroQuant).
Results: Sustained-responders to interferon showed a significant reduction in histological lesions and in their Knodell and Scheuer activity indexes. The semiquantitative systems showed no reduction in fibrosis. The FibroQuant application showed a significant reduction in porto-periportal and septal areas among sustained-responders (P<0.001) and non-responders (P<0.05), and in porto-periportal and septal fibrosis areas only in sustained-responders (P<0.001), whereas the percentage of fibrosis increased in non-responders (P<0.001).
Conclusions: The Scheuer system is useful for the daily evaluation of fibrosis, but the FibroQuant application provides more objective data on the anti-fibrogenic effects of interferon, which include a reduction in the porto-periportal area in sustained-responders and non-responders, accompanied by a reduction in the area of fibrosis only when the viral replication has ceased.

In this study the samples of guest-host polystyrene/disperse red 1 (DR1) were poled in a corona triode by a constant current method and the efficiency of poling was probed by the thermally stimulated depolarization (TSD) method. The main objective of this work was to analyze the relative importance of the parameters selected as variables in order to improve the poling efficiency for the studied guest-host system

This paper proposed an information fusion model about the comprehensive evaluation. Firstly, it chose analytic hierarchy process as the subjective evaluation method and determined the subjective weights of different indexes by using this method; secondly, it chose several objective evaluation methods based on the classifying of related methods, and proposed an objective weights combination method based on the objects´ willingness; finally, it proposed a subjective weights modifying model based on the decision-maker´s preference and the information provided by objective combined evaluation. This model can reflect the decision-maker´s preference sufficiently, it can take fully use of the objective information provided by data mining too.

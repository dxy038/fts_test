Objective: Our purpose was to determine whether a history of irregular menses predicts gestational diabetes mellitus independently of traditional risk factors. Study Design: We analyzed demographic characteristics, body mass index, and menstrual history of 85 pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus and compared them with 85 systematically selected control subjects who were matched for age, race, and delivery year. Subjects with pregestational diabetes mellitus, previous gestational diabetes mellitus, family history of diabetes mellitus, weight >200 pounds, previous macrosomic infants, or previous stillbirth were excluded. Results: Demographic characteristics between case and control groups were similar. Mean body mass index was higher among cases (26.5 kg/m2) versus control subjects (24.5 kg/m2, P = .004). Irregular cycles were more prevalent in the cases (24% vs 7%, P = .006). With the use of body mass index as a stratification factor, menstrual irregularity maintained a strong association with gestational diabetes mellitus (P = .014). Conclusion: A history of irregular menstrual cycles was a significant independent predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus. If selective screening is implemented for gestational diabetes mellitus, such history should be considered in the decision of whom to test. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1189-91.)

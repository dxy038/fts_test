The acronym Radio on Visible Light which has already been introduced is associated with using visible light to transmit information usually carried by means of radio waves from one point to another. Essentially, the radio waves are not radiated from an antenna in the usual manner, but emitted as a modulation of the lightÂ´s brightness in congruence with the strength of the radio frequency signal. To address the project objective, various attributes influencing mobile signal transmission through visible light channels have already been identified and addressed. This paper presents a brief theoretical study on the attributes of channel modeling, influencing mobile signal transmission in an indoor environment. The main purpose is to understand the behaviour and propagation of optical signals based on traditional models to improve upon the basic channel models to more sophisticated techniques that can be specifically adapted for indoor mobile telecommunications.

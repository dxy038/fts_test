In this paper, a rib-reinforced thin-walled hollow tube-like beam (named as rib-reinforced beam) is presented for potential application in vehicle bumper. Through numerical simulation of the bending behavior under impact loads, the rib-reinforced beam is compared with thin-walled hollow tube-like beams filled with and without foam materials (empty beam and foam-filled beam) in crashworthiness. The effects of the shape of the reinforced rib are investigated and the shape optimization design is performed for increasing energy absorption and reducing the initial peak force. A multi-objective crashworthiness optimization formulation including maximum energy absorption, maximum specific energy absorption and minimum initial peak force is constructed based on the ideal point method (IPM). The optimum configuration of the reinforced rib is given with a normalized cubic spline function. Numerical example results show that, compared with the empty and foam-filled beams with same weights, the optimized rib-reinforced beam has higher energy absorption performance and lower initial crash force. It is found that for the rib-reinforced beam little rumple is formed around the compressed indention, which helps to retard the collapse of the side wall and means more energy absorption.

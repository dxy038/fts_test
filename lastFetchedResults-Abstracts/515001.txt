Background: Objective estimates of likelihood of death in burn patients would be useful in making treatment plans. Recently burn mortality has been decreased. Investigators were trying to find more integrated system of risk stratification in this group. The acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III is widely used to predict outcome in intensive care units. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic value of ABSI and APACHE III in burn patients.
Materials and Method: The current cross-sectional study was conducted during a six month period in Imam-Reza hospital burn unit. In all patients more than 16 year-old the following variables were recorded. Age, sex, TBSA, percentage of deep burn and mucosal injuries, ABSI score, APACHE score and outcome of 90 patients were analyzed.  Mean and standard deviation of scores were calculated. The independent t-test was used to compare the mean scores of the variables. P-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant 
Results: Ninety patients enrolled into the study (35 male and 55 female). Seventy cases survived (group 1) and 20 died (group 2). The mean score of ABSI system were significantly different between two groups (p < 0.001).In contrast on the basis of APACHE system the differences between two groups were not statistically significant.
Conclusion: ABSI is a reliable predictor burn patientâ€™s mortality. The issue is in doubt for APACHE and needs to be more investigated. [ZJRMS, 2012; 13(9): 33-38]

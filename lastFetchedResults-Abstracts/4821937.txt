The possibility of extending some of the logical methods that have been recommended for the design of software to the design of hardware, in particular, of synchronous switching circuits implemented in CMOS, is explored. The objective is to design networks that are known by construction. Things that can go wrong with circuits designed in this way are examined. The application of the techniques is discussed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

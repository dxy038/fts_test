Real-time monitoring of agricultural crops is increasingly important because of the involved huge economic impact. The automatic identification of crops, as early as possible during the agricultural season, is an important issue supporting agricultural policies. In this context, the objective of this article is to evaluate the possibilities of remote sensing data to identify corn and soybean crops in the early growing season. The proposed study evaluates the potential of hyperspectral data and multispectral NDVI times series. Experimental results illustrate the challenges of crop detection in early stages.

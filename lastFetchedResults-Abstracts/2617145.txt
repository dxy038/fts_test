Flood peak discharge (FPD) is an important factor determination of the dimension
hydraulic structures. Statistical analyses of rainfall and peak flow discharge are two
important methods of FPD estimation, with the assumption that retun period of rainfall
and FDP are the same. The objective of this study is to investigate the relation between
return period of FPD and return period of rainfall intensity in Amamah watershed with
an area of 37,2 km2 located in south Alborz and upstream of Lattian dam, and Kassilian
watershed with an area of 66,75 km2 located in north Alborz. In this research, 26 years
(1970-1996) of flood hydrographs and rainfall hyetographs data maintained by Water
Ressources Organization was used. Return period of peak flood against retun period of
rainfall intensity with 15 miniutes to 24 hours durations were considered. This was done
for up to 2years and more for Amameh and up to 2 to 5 years and more for Kassilian
watershed separately. In general, the obtained correlation coefficients were low. The
best correlation obtained for 6 hours duration rainfall in Amameh watershed and 8 hours
duration rainfall in Kassilian watershed. Return period of floods against corresponding
rainfall showed better correlation in both watersheds especially in the smaller one.
Maximum correlation coefficient obtained for a small sub-basin of Amameh watershed
called Bagh-tangeh with an area of 16,1 km2. In order to obtain more accurate results, data related to spacial and temporal variation of crop cover, snow cover, base flow, and
anticident soil moisture is required.

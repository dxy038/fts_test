A novel surface profile measuring method which is useful in micro-mechatronics is reported. The instrument for this method has simple construction and consists of a cylindrical lens, a CCD placed at an angle to the optical axis of the cylindrical lens, an objective lens, and a light source. This method can measure surface height without scanning to optical axis. Calculation and experiments show that this method is capable of measuring with an accuracy of &#177;5 &#956;m and dynamic range of 150 &#956;m

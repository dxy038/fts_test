Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a managerial powerful tool to evaluate the relative efficiency of each decision making unit (DMU). Nowadays, multi-objective DEA models in static environment are an attractive technique for evaluation quantity and quality aspects of performance analysis because there is some weakness in single objective DEA such as one-dimensional performance analysis and also it is important to consider the decision maker(s) preference over the potential adjustments of various inputs and outputs when DEA is employed. In this paper, a fuzzy dynamic multi-objective DEA model is presented in which data are changing sequentially. This paper assesses the performance of the railways using presented model as a numerical example to evaluate the results of the model. Results indicate that the multiple objective program model improves discriminating power of classical DEA models with just one time calculation of the efficiency achievement for all DUMs.

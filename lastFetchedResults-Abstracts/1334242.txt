Background: Concerns on the safety of polio vaccine in some parts of northern Nigeria that
led to the suspension of the immunization efforts in those parts of the country, informed our
design of this prospective study.
Objective: To determine polio-specific Immunoglobulin G antibodies among children (seven
months - seven years) in Jos.
Methods: Within the months of March and April 2007, One hundred and eighty two blood
samples were collected from children in the Emergency Peadiatric Unit of the Jos University
Teaching Hospital and tested for the presence of polio-specific IgG antibodies using Poliomyelitis
IgG ELISA Test Kit produced and described by DEMEDITEC Diagnostic GmbH Germany.
Results: One hundred and seventy eight percent (97.8%) of the tested children had detectable
antibodies against poliovirus. The study population had appreciable levels of protection
against poliovirus. There was no significant association between the detection of the IgG in
children in relation to gender, age, religion, and number of doses. Only educational status of
fathers had statistically significant relationship with the detection of the antibodies.
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that progress has been made towards the eradication of
poliomyelitis in Nigeria. To further strengthen the gains made and weaken the barriers to
immunization, there is an increasing need for more funding to increase awareness and intensify
the final efforts targeted at ‘kicking polio’ out of Nigeria.

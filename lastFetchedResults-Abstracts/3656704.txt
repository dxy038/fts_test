In this paper, we propose novel methods to evaluate the performance of object detection algorithms in video sequences. This procedure allows us to highlight characteristics (e.g., region splitting or merging) which are specific of the method being used. The proposed framework compares the output of the algorithm with the ground truth and measures the differences according to objective metrics. In this way it is possible to perform a fair comparison among different methods, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses and allowing the user to perform a reliable choice of the best method for a specific application. We apply this methodology to segmentation algorithms recently proposed and describe their performance. These methods were evaluated in order to assess how well they can detect moving regions in an outdoor scene in fixed-camera situations

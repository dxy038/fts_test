A didactic explanation of AC power using the generalized instantaneous power theory is presented in this paper. After a review of this theory, its relationship with the classical AC power definitions is described. In order to understand the presented concepts, two different computer simulations are shown. First, a three-phase balanced circuit is analyzed which contains no harmonics. Second, a three-phase power rectifier is studied with this theory. Fundamental and harmonic power concepts are commented upon in detail. The obtained results are used to understand AC power in electronic equipment for instrumentation and diagnosis purposes of three-phase systems. The final objective of this work is focused on the monitoring and efficiency optimization of three-phase electric drives

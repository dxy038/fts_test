Objective: This study was undertaken to examine the possibility of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or contact dermatitis occurring in the guinea-pig in response to methacrylate derivatives used as experimental dentine primers.

Method: The dentine primers 2-HEMA, GM, MA and MMA were tested in a guinea-pig maximization test.

Results: All the dentine primers tested produced positive delayed hypersensitivity reactions in the guinea-pig. MMA produced the most severe reaction.

Conclusion: It is concluded that in the clinical situation, clinicians and other members of the dental team should be aware of the need for careful handling of the dentine primers tested.

Objective: To assess and analyze the presentation of disease, treatment options available in peripheral hospitals, postoperative complications, effects of delaying the surgery, evaluate the cost of treatment and choice of anesthesia.Material and Methods: A retrospective study of groin hernia was carried out in surgical ward of DHQ Teaching Hospital Dera Ismail Khan from Feb. 1999 to Dec. 2002. All the cases of groin hernia were admitted to surgical ward either as elective cases or through emergency. They were analyzed for age, sex, site and type of hernia, operative procedure under local or general anesthesia, post operative complications and duration of stay in the ward. Comparison of surgeon convenience and operative cost of cases under local or general anesthesia was made.Results: A total 654 cases (0.9% of total admissions for the same period) were admitted out of which 585(89.5%) were elective and 69(10.5%) were through emergency. Distribution of cases was uniform along different decades of life with peak in the 1st decade. Male patients were 638(97.56%) and female patients were 16(2.44%). Right side groin hernia were 423(64.8%), left side 211(32.1%) and bilateral hernia were 20(3.1%). Over all complication rate was 11.02% and no mortality was reported in emergency or elective group of patients. Hospital stay was short (3.59 days), and operation under local anesthesia was convenient for patient and surgeon.Conclusion: Groin hernia is a common and relatively simple problem. It should be operated at the earliest and unnecessary delay can cause complications. Operation under local anesthesia is a viable alternative to general anesthesia.

This paper proposes a new nature inspired optimization technique known as BAT Optimization Algorithm (BATOA) for optimal design of Power System Stabilizer (PSS) in order to damp power system oscillations usually tempt to grow in multi machine power system when a fault is occurred. The design problem of PSS is formulated as an optimization problem to minimize the value of objective function. BAT algorithm is then employed to search for best parameters of PSS for which the value of objective function is global minimum under all boundary conditions. In the simulation, the linearized model of power system and conventional lead-lag controller as PSS structure are used. The results obtained from BATOA are compared with the obtained results using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The comparison of both algorithm reveals the effectiveness of BATOA over PSO in tuning of PSS parameters for multi machine power system.

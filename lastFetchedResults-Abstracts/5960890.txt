The differential diagnostics of traditional Chinese medicine is the kernel of TCM. The objective study of TCM diagnostics is a research hot spot at present. The differential diagnostics process of TCM is very complex and nonlinear. Support vector machine (SVM) is a novel method to establish the diagnosis model of TCM. In this paper, the differential diagnostics model is constructed base on multi-SVM. A comparison is made between Gaussian and poly kernel functions in SVM for differential diagnostics. The model based on multi-SVM presented can deal with accompanying syndromes better. The model can provide a new way to solve TCM differential diagnostics.

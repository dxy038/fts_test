Background: It is appear, that the harvesting time of fruit is one affecting factor on the amount of flavor constituents existed in fruit peel oil (aldehydes, alcohols and esters).
Objective: The goal of the present study is to investigate on flavor constituents of page mandarin peel and their variations during a season.
Methods: In the last part of November and February 2009, ten mature fruit were harvested and their Peel oil was extracted by using cold-press and eluted by using n-hexan, then analyzed by GC and GC-MS.
Results: In the last part of November, the amounts of aldehydes, alcohols and esters existed in the fruit peel oil were 1.34, 1.87 and 0.17, respectively. In the last part of February, these amounts were 0.46, 1.06 and 0.04, respectively.
Conclusion: Oxygenated constituents, especially decanal and linalool, showed remarkable decreased in their relative concentration as the fruit harvested lately, where as the concentration of limonene showed a corresponding increase.

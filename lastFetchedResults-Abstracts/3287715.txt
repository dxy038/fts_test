Visual odometry is important to obtain the vehicle motion as well as the relative motion of the surroundings such as moving/stationary objects to the vehicle. This paper presents a vehicle motion estimation approach which uses 3D vector correspondences. We design an objective function using 3D vector registration error and optimize it. The proposed method estimates more accurate rotation matrix compared to the previous method.

TerraSAR-X is a highly flexible X-band radar satellite. Its primary objective is the acquisition of high quality SAR images in a multitude of possible acquisition modes. The great amount of antenna patterns needed for image acquisition requires an antenna model accurately describing all beams. To guarantee the required image quality, the model is verified in-orbit. As TerraSAR-X is scheduled for launch in June 2007, this paper will present the necessity of the antenna model and the methods to verify it.

The objective of this study is to optimize experimental conditions of sorbent preparation from sewage sludge using experimental design methodology. Series of carbonaceous sorbents have been prepared by chemical activation with sulfuric acid. The sorbents produced were characterized, and their properties (surface chemistry, porous and adsorptive properties) were analyzed as a function of the experimental conditions (impregnation ratio, activation temperature and time). Carbonaceous sorbents developed from sludge allow copper ion, phenol and dyes (Acid Red 18 and Basic Violet 4) to be removed from aqueous solution as well as VOC from gas phase. Indeed, according to experimental conditions, copper adsorption capacity varies from 77 to 83 mg g−1, phenol adsorption capacity varies between 41 and 53 mg g−1 and VOC adsorption capacities (acetone and toluene) range from 12 to 54 mg g−1. Each response has been described by a second-order model that was found to be appropriate to predict most of the responses in every experimental region. The most influential factors on each experimental design response have been identified. Regions in which optimum values of each factor were achieved for preparation of activated carbons suitable for use in wastewater and gas treatments have been determined using response surfaces methodology. In order to have a high mass yield and to minimize the energetic cost of the process, the following optimal conditions, 1.5 g of H2SO4 g−1 of sludge, 700 °C and 145 min are more appropriate for use of activated carbon from sludge in water and gas treatments.

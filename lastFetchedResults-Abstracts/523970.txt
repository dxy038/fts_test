Objective: Morphological changes of CA1 neurons in rat hippocampus after transient
and permanent focal cerebral ischemia were studied to clarify the nature of postischemic
cell death in the subfield.
Materials and Methods: Male adult rats were divided into 3 groups: Control (Shamoperated),
transient ischemic group (30 minutes of MCAO followed by 48 hours of
reperfusion), and permanent ischemic group (48 hours of MCAO). After the mentioned
times, deep anesthesia was induced in the rats and their brains were removed and
processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and evaluation.
Results: Electron-microscopic examination on day 2 showed key morphological signs
of apoptosis in the permanent ischemic group, while morphological signs of necrosis
were observed in the transient ischemic group.
Conclusion: These results suggest necrosis (as dominant mechanism of neuronal
death after transient ischemia) and apoptosis (after permanent ischemia) to be involved
in neuronal death.

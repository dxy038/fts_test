The author investigates the shielding effectiveness of triaxial cables employing optimum designs for braids in their inner and outer shields. This is done by calculating the time and frequency domain responses of inner-most line to the fields induced on the shield of the outer line. For most optimised braids, transfer admittance is in the same order of transfer impedance and thus both of these parameters were employed in the crosstalk model. Since the objective was to identify triaxial configurations which would yield minimum crosstalk, several designs including both standard and optimized braid constructions were simulated and studied numerically. Triaxial configurations with shorted intermediate circuit are used in all simulations

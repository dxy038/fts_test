In this paper we propose an adaptive controller for robots with camera-in-hand configuration using visual feedback. The controller is designed to compensate for full robot dynamics. Adaptation is introduced to reduce the design sensitivity due to robot and payload dynamic uncertainties. The control system is proved to asymptotically achieve the position control objective in the image coordinate system. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the controller performance.

National medium and long term talent development program (2010&#8211;2020) has put forward the specific objective to build a team of rural practical talents, which is an important and urgent strategic task to be carried out by local governments, organizations and farmers together, a major strategic decision which, based on the overall development of the Party and nation, is made to help thoroughly implement the scientific concept of development, and the new requirement not only for our countryÂ´s talent strategy but also for its purpose of constructing a well-off society in an all-round way. In this paper, we first built a model of constructing rural practical talents and obtained that rational farmers would compared their costs with benefits, and we also made a further analysis of why there was blurring and distortion in the information of constructing rural practical talents they had received. From the perspective of game theory, we constructed the game model of simultaneous action among farmers with the initial endowment, the static game model of the complete information of grass-roots organizations, and the game model between farmers and grass-roots organizations, between grassroots organizations and local governments under different probabilities, in order to reflect on the construction of rural practical talent teams.

This paper proposes a nonlinear controller realizing periodic motion to MonoRotor type flying robot having no equilibrium point. The control target is semi-hovering; a motion that passes a desired non-equilibrium point at which position and attitude stop periodically. In order to achieve this control objective, we propose discontinuous and time-varying output zeroing controller which ends up controlling Zero Dynamics. The numerical simulation and stability analysis show the validity of the suggesting controller design method.

This work concerns the model reference tracking control problem for nonlinear systems represented by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) models, with a guaranteed L<sub>2</sub> performance to attenuate the tracking error for bounded reference inputs. The objective is to make the system state follow as closely as possible the model reference state. The control scheme is based on a parallel distributed compensation controller fed by a state observer for Takagi-Sugeno systems with unmeasurable premise variables. The observer/controller synthesis is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Systems with noise output measurements are also envisaged with the use of filter. Simulation example are given to illustrate the design procedures and tracking performance of the proposed approach.

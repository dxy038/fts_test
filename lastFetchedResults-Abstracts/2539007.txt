Abstract

Objective

The aim of this study was to translate and validate the psychometric properties of the Quality of Life Kindl questionnaire.

Materials & Methods

Parents of 4-7 yr-old healthy and ill children referred to Mofid Children Hospital in Tehran in 2013, Iran were sampled randomly in two groups each of which 130 people. After translation, the questionnaie’s validity and reliability was evaluated and was confirmed for face and content validity. Questionnaire was also completed by two (one healthy and one ill) groups for which inclusion criteria included consent of the parents, age of the children being beween 4 and 7 yr, and presence of the child in a nursery school, kindergarten, school or any class at least for one month. Exclusion criteria were inability of the parents in answering the questions accurately. Inclusion criterion for the ill group was having chronic cardiac, neurologic, hematologic, or respiratory diseases, lasting longer than 3 months for which they were followed up in outpatient clinic in the hospital. The reliability of questionnaire was measured by the Cronbach’s alpha.

Data were analyzed using factor analysis, Spearman’s correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney and Chi-square test.

Results

The reliability was 0.85 and 0.81 in healthy and ill groups, respectively. The results of factor analysis showed that each of eight subscales of questionnaire had acceptable construct validity. Only two of 52 questions of the questionnaire did not have proper correlation coefficient.

Conclusion

Quality of Life Kindl Questionnaire is a valid and reliable test for assessing healthy and ill children in Iran.

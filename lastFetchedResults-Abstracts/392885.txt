Objective
Although sensorineural hearing loss has been widely investigated in those with rheumatoid arthritis, studies assessing the vestibular system in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are limited. The aim of this study was to assess the vestibular system in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Methods
The study consisted of 43 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 30 healthy controls. Otorhinolaryngologic and neurotologic examinations, pure-tone audiometry, impedancemetry, electronystagmography including smooth pursuit, saccade, positional, and caloric tests were performed in all patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in controls. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and rheumatoid factor level were evaluated in all patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Results
Audiograms revealed sensorineural hearing loss in 12 patients (27.9%) with rheumatoid arthritis and in two controls (6.6%); the difference was statistically significant (P = .033). In those with rheumatoid arthritis, the results of electronystagmography revealed central abnormalities in nine patients (20.9%), peripheral abnormalities in three (6.9%), and mixed abnormalities in three (6.9%). Smooth pursuit and saccade tracing impairments were significantly higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (P > .05). Canal paresis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were significantly higher than those in the control group (P = .039). No association was found between electronystagmographic abnormalities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and age, sex, duration of disease, the results of laboratory testing, sensorineural hearing loss, or medication use.
Conclusion
Our results suggest an association of rheumatoid arthritis with vestibular system dysfunction as well as auditory impairment.

In this paper, a damping injection control of isolated bidirectional DC-DC converters based on the load parameter identification is proposed. By setting up the simplified state space average mode in the phase shift control, a damping injection control is designed and analyzed. Compared to the traditional proportional-integral (PI) control, the damping injection control can achieve a better dynamic performance. As the damping injection control depends on the load parameter, an identification function for load parameter is proposed to overcome the disadvantage. Experimental results from a prototype verify the correctness of theoretical analyses, and show the excellent performances of the proposed control method.

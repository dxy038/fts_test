Data mining in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a new emerging research area. This paper investigates the problem of real time clustering of sensory data in WSNs. The objective is to cluster the data collected by sensor nodes in real time according to data similarity in a d-dimensional sensory data space. To perform in-network data clustering efficiently, a Hilbert Curves based mapping algorithm, HilbertMap, is proposed to convert a d-dimensional sensory data space into a two-dimensional area covered by a sensor network. Based on this mapping, a distributed algorithm for clustering sensory data, H-Cluster, is proposed. It guarantees that the communications for sensory data clustering mostly occur among geographically nearby sensor nodes and sensory data clustering is accomplished in in-network manner. Extensive simulation experiments were conducted using both real-world datasets and synthetic datasets to evaluate the algorithms. H-Cluster consistently achieves the lowest data loss rate, the highest energy efficiency, and the best clustering quality.

Astaxanthin extracted from green algae is desirable in the food and pharmaceutical industries due to its antioxidant properties.
The green unicellular clear water microalga Haematococcus pluvialis has a high production rate of astaxanthin; indeed, it contains
more than 80% astaxanthin content in its cells. This remarkable astaxanthin production is commonly obtained under stress conditions
such as nutrient deficiency (N or P), high NaCl concentrations, variations of temperature, and other factors. In this vein, a
great research effort has been oriented to determine optimal conditions for astaxanthin production by H. pluvialis.
The objective of the present study was the analysis of environmental factors, such as light intensity, aeration and nutrients on the
growth and astaxanthin production of H. pluvialis. Maximum growth of H. pluvialis obtained was 3.5 Â· 105 cells/ml in BBM medium
at 28  C under continuous illumination (177 lmol photon m 2 s 1) of white fluorescent light, with continuous aeration (1.5 v.v.m.).
Meanwhile, maximal astaxanthin production was 98 mg/g biomass in BAR medium with continuous illumination (345 lmol photon
m 2 s 1), with 1 g/l of sodium acetate and without aeration

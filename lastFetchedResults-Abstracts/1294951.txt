We extend a classical common due-window assignment problem to a setting of parallel uniform machines. Jobs are assumed to have identical processing times. The objective is minimum earliness, tardiness, due-window starting time, and due-window size. We focus on the case of two machines. Despite the many (12) candidate schedules for optimality, an efficient constant time solution is introduced.

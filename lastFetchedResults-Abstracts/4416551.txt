This paper presents a tubular linear flux-switching permanent magnet (TLFSPM) motor. It has an inner mover which only consists of iron core, and stator which contains the magnets and armature windings. The objective of this paper is to propose the TLFSPM motor design and mathematical model. This motor has a smaller cogging force and force ripple, in addition, it overcome unbalanced magnetic circuit on end coil. Then we adopt FEM, and obtained some simulation results to verify the effectiveness of this motor. It is shown that this motor have a higher thrust force density as compared to a flux-switching machine equipped with a conventional configuration.

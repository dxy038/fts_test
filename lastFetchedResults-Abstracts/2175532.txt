The objective of the study was to characterize the chemical constituents, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of five ecotypes of Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil with respect to main phytogeographic grown towns in Iran. Our investigation showed that the plants had essential oil yield ranging from 1.59 ± 0.86% to 0.99 ± 0.29% v/w. There were qualitative similarities among the oils from different origins, whereas the amounts of some components were varied. From different samples, 34, 34, 32, 29 and 53 various compounds were identified, representing 98.32%, 97.77%, 99.5%, 98.38% and 96.54% of total oils, respectively. The highest oxygenated monoterpens value in this study stood at 72.99%. Moreover, thymol, a phenolic compound of oxygenated monoterpens, was the most abundant component in GC/MS ranging from 27.05% to 64.87%. In the DPPH antioxidant assay, all samples exhibited a remarkable activity with a higher degree of IC50 = 19.7 ± 0.7 μg/ml almost similar to BHT (18.1 ± 0.4 μg/ml). Escherichia coli O157:H7 was the most resistant and Candida tropicalis was the most vulnerable organisms with MICs of 16 and 0.062 mg/ml, respectively. In conclusion, it seemed that geographical variation might have influenced the oil compounds either quantitatively or qualitatively.

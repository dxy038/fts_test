Summary
s paper, I have attempted to explore the role of non-nurse lecturers in adding value to nurse education programmes. In measuring ‘added-value’ in higher education, I have embraced a more comprehensive approach including investigating the views of ‘Experts’; including the nurse and non-nurse lecturers themselves, and various United Kingdom stakeholders such as the Government, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the Quality Assurance Agency. The students’ views are also taken into account, when considering both the content of the programmes and how they are delivered. The complexity of ‘objective measurement’ is considered, and the requirements of a ‘good’ teaching experience.

tential areas for adding value include: health and social care policy priorities which encourage partnership working, the blurring of professional boundaries, and inter-professional working. Professional-specific changes embracing extended and enhanced roles and the concepts of specialist and assistant practitioners. Other areas include the Higher Education agendas including transferable skills and adult and student-centred learning. I conclude by discussing the latest policy changes and suggest that the role of the non-nurse lecturer needs more exploration to provide the best value for all.

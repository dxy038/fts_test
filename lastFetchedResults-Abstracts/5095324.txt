GaN based bidirectional Super Heterojunction Field Effect Transistors (BiSHFETs) using the polarization junction (PJ) concept are demonstrated for the first time. The fabricated BiSHFETs are arrayed on an insulator substrate of Sapphire and measured isolation voltage between the devices is more than 2 kV. Measured on-resistances of the fabricated BiSHFETs with MES and PN gate structures are 24 &#937;mm and 22 &#937;mm in the both directions respectively.

The main objective of this paper is to present an approach allowing equipping the virtual information integration systems by mechanisms of knowledge management in order to return better responses to user demands. These mechanisms will help the integration systems to take into account the user logic (for the requested information treatment) and the information production logic (the logic of the information itself).

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of endurance running training and calcium supplementation on tibial bone strength in ovariectomized Sprague Dawley rats. Forty-one rats were randomly divided into endurance running training, calcium supplement, control, Pretest and Base groups. An endurance running training program was carried out for five days a week at a definite treadmill speed and duration for 8 weeks. Also, Calcium group received calcium supplement known as Osteocare Liquid (35 mg/ kg in 5 days per week for 8 weeks) by using Gavage. Tibial bone strength was measured by HOUNSFIELD system. Data was analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance and dependent t-student tests. Statistical Significance was accepted at P<0.05. Results showed that ovariectomy leads to significant decrease and endurance running training or calcium supplement cause nonsignificant increase of tibial bone strength. However, the research findings using by ANOVA shows the endurance running and calcium supplementation significantly increased tibial bone strength compared with age-matched control group (P val ue equal to 0.036 and 0.045, respectively). Whereas, there are not significant difference between endurance running and calcium supplementation groups(P= 0.609).The results of this study suggest that life method and nutrition are important determinants in prevention of osteoporosis and the endurance running training program and calcium supplementation had an inhibitory effect or reversal on menopause- induced decrease of tibial bone strength.

Inroduction & Objective: Cancer is dynamic process which causes molecular changes and interference in cell proliferation system by numerous independent variables, breast cancer involves such changes so that it has the highest rate of cancer among women.The purpose of this study is studings the anticancer effect of Nigella seeds extract in breast cancer,so that the effect of nutrition with Nigella seeds oil on ativity of antioxdant enzymes in splees of mice effected by breast cancer is studied.
Materials and Methods: Four group of Balb/c mice are divided to one control group and 3 traetment groups,in control group, Gavage was done by distilled water and in  three other groups, gavage was done by nigella seeds oil with dosages of 1,2,4 mg/Kg body weight for 4 months,then the mice received tumor pieces through operation intradermally,Tumor volume was studied by V= LW2/2 and it's dimensions were measured by digital caliper.
Results: The results of this study indicated that the average volume of tumors of mice treated with Nigella seeds oil with dosage of 4mg/kg body weight indicated a significant difference compared to control group in data analysis,as well as the rate of vessels congestion in mice treated with Nigella seeds oil with dosage of 4 mg/kg body weight indicated a meaningful reduction.
 Conclusion: Probaby,Nigella seeds oil has protective effect against cancer cells with decrease cancer cell and vessels congestion and increase appotes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Uroflowmetry is a non-invasive, fast and suitable procedure for screening of voiding dysfunction and bladder function. Since position of voiding affect uroflowmetry parameters, so the aim of this study was to detect the best of voiding position to decrease of bladder pressure in patients with lower urinary tract signs.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 63 patients (range 18-60 years) with lower urinary tract signs consist of frequency, urgency, hesitancy and nocturia included 44 man and 19 women were enrolled. Patients with urinary infection and patients who could not void in any positions were excluded in this study. Uroflowmetry study was done for each subject in comparison with urinary normal curve in three positions: crouching, sitting and standing for men and two positions: crouching and sitting for women and then compared. 
FINDINGS: The mean Qmax just in standing position (15.55±6.47) for men was lower than crouching position (16.64±8.28) and sitting position (17.67± 8.08) (p < 0.018).The mean hesitancy just in women in crouching was less than sitting position (14.41±3.68 vs. 15.72±5.9) (p < 0.008). Voiding residue just in standing position for men was significantly higher than two other positions (p < 0.001). In two genders, voided volume and mean Qmax did not seem to be affected by voiding position. 
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the best voiding position in patients with lower urinary tract and urethra stenosis were sitting and crouching positions.

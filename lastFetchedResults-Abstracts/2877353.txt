The IDEF-SIM technique was developed in order to facilitate the translation of conceptual models to computational models. Papers using this technique can be found in the existing literature, however, none present an analysis of how the technique behaves throughout all of the stages of a discrete event simulation project. Therefore, a research-action was developed with the practical objective of constructing a computational model as a help to future decision making. The knowledge objective is to analyze the applicability of this technique in all of the stages of the discrete event simulation project. It was concluded that the IDEF-SIM demonstrates as applicable: during the conception stage in which information of the process was documented in detail; during the implementation stage in which the conceptual model was converted into a computational model; and during the analysis phase, promoting the communication between modulators and managers in the presentation of proposed changes.

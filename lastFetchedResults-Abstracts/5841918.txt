This paper proposes to apply VE to the total life cycle of construction projects, and also proposes a dynamic life cycle cost management model, which pays attention to function analysis in investment decision phase and combines cost management methods such as supply chain management and Kaizen costing based on objective cost management in implementation phase. The model provides a new thought for best realizing the value of construction projects with minimum life cycle cost.

A new method, to realize bidirectional drive and control to a micro in-pipe robot based on dynamic friction characteristics of its elastic legs and drive characteristics of giant magnetostriction actuator through magnetic field outside pipe, is put forward, in which its positive direction drive is carried out by utilizing the multiple frequency phenomenon of GMM, while its adverse moving is implemented by applying direct current offset magnetic field to change the slant of its elastic legs. By brief introduction on its systematical structure and operation principle, research on dynamic characteristics of double drive is conducted deeply by setting up its double drive kinematics equations. Robot systematical experiments to verify its feasibility are conducted

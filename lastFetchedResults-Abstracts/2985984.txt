A control system for elevator vibration reduction is designed incorporating a new feature, i.e., parameter variation in the elevatorÂ´s dynamics. First, the dynamical model of an elevator is formulated, by assuming that at high speed vertical movement the stiffness of the guide rail varies against the elevator vertical position. Next, a controller is designed with the main objective to reduce vibration caused by any external force. When it is stationary the controller works in reducing vibration due to the shock when a passenger gets in to or get out of the elevator, and when it is moving up and down the controller reduces vibration caused by irregularity or unshape of the guide-rail and by parameter variation. Finally, the performance of the designed controller is evaluated through computer simulation. Simulation results show that the controller designed enhances significantly the performance of the elevator

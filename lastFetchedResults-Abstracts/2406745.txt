Objective
Homocystinuria is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism caused by
cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency that affects methionine metabolism. The
clinical features are heterogeneous ranging from mental retardation, ectopia
lentis, and osteoporosis to vascular events such as deep vein thrombosis, sagital
sinus thrombosis, and myocardial infarction.
Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CVST) is an unusual disorder in children
and requires prompt and accurate management. Some causal factors for the
development of CVST differ between children and adults. The majority of
cases with CSVT are found to have an underlying cause for thrombosis like
dehydration, infections, prothrombotic and hematologic disorders, malignancy
and trauma.
Although homocystinuria is usually associated with ischemic strokes, CVST as
initial clinical presentation of homocystinuria is rare in children.
In this article, we presented a 10-year old boy with seizure, hemiparesis, and
ataxia due to CSVT caused by homocystinuria.

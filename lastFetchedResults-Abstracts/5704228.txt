The objective of this work is the systematic study of the use of electrochemical readout for advanced diagnosis and drug monitoring. Whereas to date various electrochemical principles have been studied and successfully tested, they typically operate on a single target molecule and are not integrated in a full data analysis chain. The present work aims to view various sensing approaches and explore the design space for integrated realization of multi-target sensors and sensor arrays.

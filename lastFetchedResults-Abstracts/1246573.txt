The results of a study aimed at verifying the possible use of global positioning system (GPS) and geographical information system (GIS) technologies to understand the behaviour of domestic and wild animals bred for extensive grazing are presented. For this purpose an experimental survey was carried out in order to track animal location in the various grazing areas at the Animal Research Center of the University of Kentucky. The data have been analysed and indicate some potentially positive and useful technical applications. Using GPS, it is possible to automatically gather data with increased accuracy in the locations. Applications of GIS have proved suitable for data processing (resting and grazing times, available land surfaces, etc.). It has furthermore been determined how the ‘kernel home-range’ method may be used to reach objective conclusions on territorial and biological matters in order to solve problems of environmental planning connected with extensive cattle grazing.

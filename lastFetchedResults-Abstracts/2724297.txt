Tip clearance is critical to the performance of rotating turbomachinery. The objective of this paper is to develop a noncontact sensor with a precision of 30 &#956;m to measure tip clearance in a turbine rig assembled in a wind tunnel. To carry out the measurements, an optical sensor whose main component is a bundle of optical fibers is employed. We use four different configurations of this sensor, which are tested in two distinct turbines with the aim of minimizing the effect of the noise on the repeatability of the measurements. Each configuration serves to increase the precision until the required performance is achieved for the measurement of the tip clearance. Our results may be helpful to develop applications related to structural health monitoring or active clearance-control systems.

Choosing suitable and excavating potential civil aircraft suppliers are key links of realizing the aircraft collaborative development, and important factors to improve competitiveness of the aviation supply chain. In view of this, according to the characteristics of civil aircraft supplier selection, imitating the idea of multi-target weighted grey target decision and using the grey clustering method to construct the airliner supplier evaluation clustering method. Firstly, indicator system of civil aircraft supplier evaluation is designed, and the multi-objective intelligent weighted grey target decision method is used to dimensionless processing for supplier evaluation indicators, and then the improved triangle whitening weight function clustering method is applied to evaluating suppliers clustering, lastly the validity and rationality of the model is verified by giving an example of supplier selection for an aircraft structure part clustering evaluation. The results show that the method constructed can handle aircraft supplier evaluation and clustering problems well, and choose aircraft supplier effectively.

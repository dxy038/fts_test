Sound strength and reverberation time measurements have been carried out in six small concert halls in Cambridge, UK. The sound strength G is a measure of the physical sound level in a concert hall and is closely related to the subjective sensation of loudness. It compares integrated impulse responses at a point in the measured room with that measured at ten metres distance in the free field.

The aim of the measurements is to investigate the acoustic characteristics of the halls concerning sound strength and reverberation time. Furthermore the effect of the variable acoustics in the halls on these parameters is discussed in this paper. Especially for bigger ensembles it is often desirable to reduce the sound level in a small concert hall. The measurement results show that for a fixed hall volume, this can primarily be achieved by decreasing the reverberation time in the hall. However, with regard to the sound quality of a hall and the recommended reverberation times for chamber music, reverberation time cannot be reduced by an arbitrary extent. Therefore reverberation time and strength have to be balanced very carefully in order to obtain sufficient reverberation whilst at the same time avoiding excessive loudness. Finally the measured strength levels are compared to values derived from traditional and revised theory [Barron M, Lee L-J. Energy relations in concert auditoriums. J Acoust Soc Am 1988;84(2):618â€“28] on strength calculations in order to assess the accuracy of the theory for small chamber music halls. Possible reasons for the low measured strength levels observed are discussed with reference to related design features and objective acoustic parameters.

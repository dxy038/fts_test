Introduction: Pulmonary tuberculosis is one of the oldest and most well- known human diseases which have been with man since ancient times. The incidence of TB has been increasing over the past decades. The aim of this study was Epidemiological investigation of pulmonary tuberculosis in Urmia during 2004-2007.

Methods: The data for this descriptive-analytic study was obtained from TB patients' documented files diagnosed during 2004-2007. The data were analyzed using SPSS and WinPepi software.

The incidence rate of 6.55 in 2004 increased to 8.2 in 2007; this increase was not statistically significant, however (Trend P. V=0.22).

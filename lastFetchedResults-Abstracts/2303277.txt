BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) is a member of the retrovirus family, which often leads to the asymptomatic infection of individuals. Transmission of this virus is possible through breast-feeding, sexual contact, transfusion of contaminated blood products and use of contaminated needles. This study aimed to review the prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in high-risk patients, particularly those with thalassemia, hemophilia and hemodialysis in Iran and other countries.
METHODS: In order to find related articles, we searched in different sites including Google, Yahoo, PubMed, Irandoc, IranMedex, Magiran and SID using keywords such as HTLV-1, high-risk, transfusion, thalassemia, hemodialysis, Iran and world.
FINDINGS: In total, 45 articles were found in relation to the subject of the study. Based on the specified criteria of the study in the Iranian population, 17 papers conducted in relation to the prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in patients with thalassemia major and hemophilia were collected, 14 cases of which were about patients with thalassemia alone or those with a combination of hemodialysis and hemophilia. As for the studies conducted in other countries, 12 articles were found, 7 cases of which were about thalassemia patients; therefore, they were selected and studied.
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, the prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in high-risk patients with thalassemia, hemophilia and hemodialysis in endemic areas was higher than non-endemic areas.
KEY WORDS: Thalassemia, Hemodialysis, Hemophilia, Human retrovirus type I.

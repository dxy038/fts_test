For the purpose of improving speech transmission performance in a dome space, the acoustical properties in a dome having a diameter of 20 m were examined. The acoustical properties measured evenly on the floor of the dome were evaluated both objectively and subjectively and the interrelationship of the objective measures and subjective measures were also examined. Then, on the basis of the results of the study, simplified acoustical remedies were applied to the dome to improve speech intelligibility and the effect of the remedies was also examined. The following findings were obtained from this investigation.

(1) The speech transmission performance in the dome space without treatment by absorptive materials varies greatly with the locations of sound sources and observation points: a range of 0.17–0.59 for RASTI value and a range of 30–97% for speech intelligibility test results. (2) There are peculiar observation points at which speech transmission quality is very high due to a considerable sum of the energy arriving in the first 0.06 s after the arrival of the direct sound. (3) Of all the measured acoustical parameters, RASTI, EDT in 1 kHz band, early-to-late arriving sound energy ratio, and Ts corresponded well to the speech intelligibility test scores. (4) Rubber tiles, cotton canvas 12 m in length, and glass wool board, are effective in improving speech intelligibility remarkably due to increased sound absorption and the diffusion effect.

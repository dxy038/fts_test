The activities of route planning in logistics can be modeled according to the standard forms seen in vehicle route problems. This paper is devoted to the development of comprehensive fuzzy approach on variants of Vehicle Routing Problems when travel time is imprecise or incomplete. The problem of vehicle routing with fuzzy costs in the objective function and vehicle routing with time windows and fuzzy constraints are formulated. Hybrid heuristic algorithms for solving this problem are presented and analysed.

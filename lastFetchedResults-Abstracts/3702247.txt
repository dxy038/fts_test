An electronically scanning electron beam excited semiconductor laser device with end pumped geometry is described. The device is based on the "Camebax" type scanning electron microscope and obtains different images in reflected, transmitted, or scattered light with spatial resolution of 1 &#956;. The induced current mode is also possible. The device has a wide selection of scanning speeds, including standard TV scanning. The continuously variable mangification with ten-to-one zoom control can be carried out electronically without change of optical objective. The influence of crystal inhomogeneities picture definition is shown.

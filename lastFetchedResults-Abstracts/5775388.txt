The objective of this empirical study is to find ways that best support business performance through the alignment of organizational and technological infrastructures. Adapting D. Tapscott and A. CastonÂ´s (1993) infrastructure themes, the organizational infrastructure includes components such as common vision, cooperation, empowerment, adaptability and learning, and the technological infrastructure addresses dimensions such as user involvement, connectivity, distributed computing, flexibility and technology awareness. Top managers from 104 organizations completed a questionnaire. The data analysis is performed using structural equation modeling techniques. The results indicate that the alignment of organizational and technological infrastructure enhances business performance.

This article endeavours to examine, through a descriptive and analytical methodology, the approach taken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) regarding interdisciplinary studies in the field of higher education. The research explains the programmes and policies of this Organization in the area of higher education and discusses the process of the evolution of interdisciplinary towards transdisciplinary in the surveys and researches of this Organization. After reflecting on the reasons for its tendency towards trandisciplinary studies, it analyzes the criteria of the passage from structural interdisciplinarity to behavioural transdisciplinarity.

The article concludes that the OECD has adopted the passage from structural interdisciplinarity towards behavioural transdisciplinarity as a basis for policymaking and educational and research orientation in the field of higher education. This approach tends to promote the capabilities, innovations, skills and creativity of students and to increase their objective understanding of social and professional conditions and necessities, so that the context for their successful and constructive presence in technical markets, as well as their effective responsiveness to the needs of their society, is provided for.

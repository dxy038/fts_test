This paper presents the core of the negotiation support model for Value Management in construction. Coalition formation was presented in a logical manner and in the form of a mathematical model. It consists of the process of identifying agreement options, analysis and coalition formation. The objective of the research is to find an agreement options model and coalition algorithms for value-based decision. This objective was attained by model of satisfying game as a basis for two main preferences of value which are function and cost and provide a set of analysis on cooperative game theory to get an algorithm of coalition and the coalition formation for agreement option.

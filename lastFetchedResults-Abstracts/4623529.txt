We address the problem of determining the arrival sequencing and scheduling for aircrafts in air traffic control system. The overall objective of this problem is the minimization of delay cost. The problem is NP-hard for this reason solving the problem optimally is limited to instances of small sizes. In this paper we treat the static case of ASS problem where all data are known in advance. We begin by proposed a mathematical quadratic integer model, with the constraint of limited time window. After we propose a change of variable in order to make linear the initial quadratic constraints. The second target of this work is to resolve the model by an ant colony algorithm. Numerical simulations are applied to real data to show the effectiveness of our new formulation and our approach. They are presented at the end of this article.

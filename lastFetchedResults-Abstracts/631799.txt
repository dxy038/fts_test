This article illustrates the utility of a variety of quantitative techniques by applying them to phonetic data from the traditional English dialects. The techniques yield measures of variation in phonetic usage among English localities, identify dialect regions as clusters of localities with relatively similar patterns of usage, distinguish regions of relative uniformity from transitional zones with substantially greater variation, and identify regionally coherent groups of features that can be used to distinguish some dialect regions. Complementing each other, the techniques provide a reasonably objective method for classifying at least some traditional English dialect regions on the basis of characteristic features. The results largely corroborate standard presentations in the literature but differ in the placement of regional boundaries and identification of regional features, as well as in placing those systemic elements in a broader context of largely continuous and often random variation.

With the increasing need for refrigerated food, how to guarantee the quality of refrigerated food with cost-effective distribution activities poses a critical challenge. According to the special requirements of refrigerated food for devices and vehicles when delivered, this paper puts forward an optimization model which considers food distribution issue with time windows for refrigerated food under the condition of utilizing different modes of transport. The establishment of distribution centers is also taken into consideration because of the efficiency and effectiveness during delivery.

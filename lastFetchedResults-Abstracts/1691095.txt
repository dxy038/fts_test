Inroduction & Objective: In the research undertaken in this thesis, in order to measure the concentration of heavy metals (lead, cadmium, nickel and vanadium) in the muscle tissue of shrimp, the two sites of Helleh and Shif that are centers of Vannamei shrimp in Bushehr province were sampled during the three months of August, September and October 2012.
Material and Methods: The collected samples were divided into males and females, and Polarograph was used to measure the amount of heavy metals in muscle texture.
Results: The mean results of the concentration of cadmium in site of Helleh were 0.004 ppb in the muscles of both males and females; the concentration of lead in male was 0.0211ppb and in females 0.0202 ppb on a dry weight basis. Also, the mean result for cadmium in site of Shif was 0.0043 ppb in the muscle of males and 0.0037 ppb in females, and the concentration of lead in males was 0.0218 ppb and in females 0.0216 ppb on a dry weight basis. Finally, the accumulation of metals Pb > Cd at both sites of Helleh and Shif was obtained. The accumulation of lead and cadmium in both sites is positively correlated with the length of shrimp, and the extent of absorption of the two metals, lead and cadmium, had a moderate positive correlation However, the accumulation of nickel and vanadium in both sites was not detectable by Polarograph
Conclusion: Comparing these results with international standards such as the World Health Organization shows that the concentration of lead, cadmium, nickel, and vanadium is less than the limit, and accumulation of metals and therefore probably intended for export as well as consumer health will make it difficult to raise.
Key words: Litopenaeus vannamei, Bushehr Province, Lead, Cadmium, Nickel, Vanadium, Muscle.

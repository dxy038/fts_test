The major objective of ´Smart grid mission for India´ is to empower the Indian power sector in deploying smart grid technologies in an efficient, cost effective, innovative and scalable manner by bringing together all enabling technologies and all key stakeholders together under one roof. For implementing smart grid technologies on a larger scale Ministry of Power, Government of India is developing a self-sustainable technological base by building fourteen (14Nos.) Smart Grid Pilot Projects that are planned to be executed in power distribution sector in India. In this paper we are trying to analyze how these pilot projects are building a strong foundation for smart grid technologies like Advanced Metering Infrastructure, Demand Response, Distributed Generation, Home Area Network, Communication, Cyber Security, and Electric Vehicles, Electric Energy Storage (EES). Also this paper layouts various factors that will drive the adoption of smart grid in India like supply shortfalls, Loss reduction, Labor saving, Peak load management, Renewable Energy Integration, Technological leapfrogging.

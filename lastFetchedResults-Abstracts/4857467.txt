Development of Personal Computers and Cloud Computing, Internet of Things is making duplicating the data very feasible. In this paper we are proposing visible watermarking using FPGA which provides one to one compound mapping that allows reversible watermarking. This method can be applied for different types of host images like binary, opaque monochrome and translucent full color ones. The ultimate objective of the research is to develop low power, high performance, real-time, reliable and secured watermarking system which can provide robustness over certain attacks namely cover-up attack, cropping noise, scaling and geometric attacks.

In this paper, a strategy named Bit Importance Strategy (BIS) is introduced to improve the performance of Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) in cases in which differences in importance among bits must be considered. The main advantage of this new strategy lies in the improvement of the recall success ratio. Simulation results are given, with an application to a simplified version of a military battlefield operation, based on a theoretical analysis.

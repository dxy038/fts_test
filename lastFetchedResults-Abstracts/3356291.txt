The problem of service selection and composition is central to the field of Semantic Web Services (SWS). Developing effective selection and composition of services can not only produce dynamic service-based environments, but also help business teams and information system developers to better satisfy their user requirements. We propose a new framework, the objective of which is to go one step further during the business process modeling activity and to help analysts design their models, expressing some steps of a business process in terms of goals instead of directly attaching SOA services. Our work proposes an approach to select and combine services using Intelligent agents and planning techniques, using a goal as a source. With this approach we can produce a solution containing one or more services to reach the given goal. We propose MOSS as a formal language to describe the preconditions and effects of services and the goals of agents, and show how the evaluation mechanism can be used to check the preconditions in a given representation of the world, build the potential effects before the execution, and determine if a service will contribute to the goal of an agent.

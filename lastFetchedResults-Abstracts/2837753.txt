Chandrayaan-I, is IndiaÂ´s first scientific mission to the moon. It is launched with prime objective to expand scientific knowledge about the origin and evolution of moon. Chandrayaan-I mission carried various remote sensing instruments into space for achieving its scientific objectives. Mini-SAR was launched on Chandrayaan-I mission and operated for nine months. The prime goal of Mini-SAR on Chandrayaan-I mission is to map permanently dark areas near Polar Regions. Mini SAR data is already analyzed by the researchers in past for identifying water ice deposits. However studies comparing the behavior of lunar craters present near Polar Regions and equatorial Regions is scarce if non-existent. In present work authors have taken initiative for comparing the behavior of lunar craters present near polar and equatorial regions. Various child parameters extracted from strokes parameters for comparison purpose.

The objective of this article is to evaluate the efficiency of premature replacement of obsolete compressed-air and minimum-oil circuit breakers, manufactured by Skoda and used in the 110 kV power distribution network, operated by the JME, as Brno (South Moravian Electricity, Plc.) utility, with the latest SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breakers manufactured by Alstom, Siemens or ABB. The new circuit breakers are assumed to feature higher reliability level and lower maintenance costs. The calculation uses data recommended by the manufacturer. The maintenance of the old circuit breakers will still be optimized by using the specified mathematical model. The prematurity of the replacement consists in the discarding of the old circuit breakers five years prior the final date of their technical service life. The calculation deals with purely economic evaluation of the efficiency of such a premature replacement

When considering how to create and design Market of Data(MoDAT), the authors hypothesize that the concept of electric trucks (e-Trucks) including electric vehicles would be one of the most interesting and important categories to apply. It is expected to bring innovative technology for sustainable transportation systems such as those that have zero emissions, zero noise, zero oil (use) and zero transportation loss. And to address this matter, the authors discuss dynamic quality function deployment (DQFD) as an objective that has a high possibility of matching the idea of MoDAT. Here "dynamic" means "to use time series data."

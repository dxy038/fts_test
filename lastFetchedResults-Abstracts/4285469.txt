The objective of this paper is to present a method of target recognition based on the fuzzy logic principles applied to conventional and multifunction radars. After a presentation of the parameters which can be delivered by signal and data processing, the paper gives a description of an algorithm including both spatial and temporal merging. Computation of the basic functions (&#8220;membership function&#8221; and &#8220;density of possibility&#8221;) are emphasized for typical radar applications. Finally some simulation results are shown and discussed

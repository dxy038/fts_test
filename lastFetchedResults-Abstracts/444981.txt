Background
A major obstacle in the wide implementation of objective clinical structured examinations (OSCEs) is their high cost, averaging $200 to $300 (Canadian dollars, CDN) per candidate and estimated at up to CDN$900 per candidate if all “hidden” administrative costs are included.
Methods
A detailed cost analysis of preparing and administering OSCEs at 1 institution was undertaken over 2 years. An 18-station, 6-minute-per-station OSCE was given to a 72-student third-year medical class.
Results
The total cost of the OSCE was CDN$5,010, or $70 per student. The key factors in reaching this significantly lower per-student OSCE cost included: judicious use of standardized patients, use of academic faculty for preparing and marking the stations, and decreased secretarial and other administrative costs.
Conclusions
Data suggest that OSCEs can be set up with reasonable cost and limited resources even in smaller institutions. Cost should not be considered a major obstacle in implementing this excellent examination type in undergraduate medical education.

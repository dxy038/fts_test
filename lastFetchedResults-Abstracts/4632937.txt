In this paper, we address the problem of designing battery-friendly packet transmission policies for wireless data transmission. Our objective is to maximize the lifetime of battery for wireless devices subject to certain delay constraints. We present three packet transmission schemes and evaluate them with respect to battery performance. The first scheme based on combining multiple packets, utilizes the battery charge recovery due to long idle periods. The second scheme based on a modified version of lazy packet scheduling, draws lower current and is battery efficient. The third scheme which is based on a combination of the above two schemes, has superior battery performance at the expense of larger average packet delay. All three schemes were simulated for a wireless communication framework with Internet traffic, and the results validated.

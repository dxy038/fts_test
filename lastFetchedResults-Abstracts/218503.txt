Objective: CD133+umbilical cord blood cells were identified as a hematopoietic
stem cell which has the capacity for extensive self-renewal and differentiation.
The aim of this study was to identify the effect of staurosporine (STS), a wellknown
protein kinase inhibitor on differentiation of CD133+ cells into neural
cells.
Materials and Methods: CD1 33+ cells were enriched by immunomagnetic
beads from human mononuclear cells of umbilical cord blood and the purity
of higher than 94% was achieved by flowcytometry. Induction of differentiation
was performed by addition of STS (12.5, 25, and 50 nM). The differentiated
cells were evaluated by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR for neuron-specific
proteins and transcripts.
Results: STS-treated CD133+cells expressed mRNA transcripts for neuronspecific
neurofilament protein (NFM), and several basic helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) transcription factors important for early neurogenesis, including Otx2,
Wnt1J and Hash1 . The structural proteins characteristics of neurons including
Beta-tubulinlll and Microtubule-Associated Protein-2 (MAP-2), were shown by
immunocytochemistry. STS-treated CD133+cells also expressed the astrocytespecific
marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by immunofluorescence.
Conclusion: The human cord blood-derived CD133+hematopoietic stem cells
could differentiate into neural cell types of neuron-like cells and astrocytes by
STS treatment.

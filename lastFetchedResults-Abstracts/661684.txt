Field tests were made for the control of an olive insect pest, the olive bark beetle, Phloeotribus scarabaeoides (Col: Scolytidae), using the pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin (D) and this insecticide combined with ethylene (D + E), an attractant of the olive bark beetle. The tests were run in olive orchards in the provinces of Granada and JaÃ©n (Andalusia, southern Spain), treating several olive rows so as to create a barrier effect to control the pest attack. The main objective was to evaluate the arthropod fauna affected by these treatments. The different taxa captured have been separated in three different trophic groups: parasitoids, predators and phytophagous. A knock-down effect was found during the first dates in all the functional groups in all cases. The results showed the following trend in arthropod abundance: D + E > D > C. This trend was significant (p<0.05) for predators and phytophagous insects in both zones. The parasitoids of Prays oleae (Lep.: Plutellidae), a major olive pest, were most affected by the treatments, together with several groups of predators such as ants, cantharids, coccinellids and mirids. Data from the captures show the need to determine the optimum time for insecticide application in order to minimise its effect on beneficial insect populations.

This paper proposes an iterative strategy to address the bi-objective optimization of metabolic pathways. The metabolic system is firstly represented by the S-system formalism. Then a weighted-sum method is used iteratively to maximize the performance of a metabolic pathway while minimizing its cost. The presented iterative strategy is applied to the fermentation pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and shown to the effectiveness of the approach.

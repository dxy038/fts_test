In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model tackling the optimal planning and scheduling of surgical operations is proposed. The model determines the assignment of time slots to the surgical teams and schedules the elective inpatient surgical operations on the basis of clinical priorities. The proposed multi-objective approach takes into account and suitable balances some strategic and conflicting goals, related to the improvement of resources utilization and considering patientÂ´s priority value. In order to find the Pareto frontier, a metaheuristic approach based on the efficient implementation of genetic algorithms has been proposed. This approach allows to obtain the set of efficient solutions within reasonable computational time. Some preliminary experiments based on real-life data are reported. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, even though more extensive testing is necessary in order to finally assess and validate its impact to health care systems.

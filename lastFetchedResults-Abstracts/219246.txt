Objective- To evaluate the radiology application in diagnosis of heavy metal poisoning in
birds.
Design- Descriptive study.
Animals- In this article 4 suspected cases of heavy metal poisoning, including 3 African Grey
Parrots and a Sulfur Crested Cockatoo are described.
Procedures- Presumptive diagnosis of heavy metal poisoning was made based on history and
clinical signs including severe progressive depression, anorexia, regurgitation, vomiting, etc.
Radiographic signs like presence of metallic densities in gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
proventricular dilation and delayed GI passage time besides responses to treatment, confirm
the diagnosis. Treatment including supportive care, rehydration and chelation therapy by
administration of CaEDTA and D-penicillamine was initiated immediately after primary
diagnosis in three cases out of four which resulted in dramatic response.
Results- Based on our study, radiology can be a valuable tool for heavy metal poisoning
diagnosis in exotic birds and it can be confirmed by dramatic response to the initiation of
mentioned therapy.
Conclusion and Clinical Relevance- Heavy metal poisoning is one of the most important
toxicoses among pet and aviary birds and is commonly encountered in psittacine birds
because of their curiosity and special behavior in biting and chewing inanimate objects.
Results of this study can be useful for avian clinicians.

Removing noise in engineering drawing images is important before applying image analysis processes. Noise should be removed while keeping the fine detail of the image intact. A noise removal algorithm that can remove noise while retaining fine graphical elements is presented in this paper. The algorithm studies the neighborhood of thin lines before choosing to remove or retain it. Real scanned images from GRECpsila03 and GRECpsila05 arc segmentation contests corrupted by 15% uniform salt/pepper noise are used in this experiment. Objective distortion measurements including PSNR and MSE show that our algorithm gives better quality images compared with other methods.

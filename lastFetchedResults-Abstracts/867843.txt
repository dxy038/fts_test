This paper investigates how to adapt a discrepancy-based search method to solve two-stage hybrid
flowshop scheduling problems in which each stage consists of several identical machines operating in
parallel. The objective is to determine a schedule that minimizes the makespan. We present an adaptation
of the Climbing Depth-bounded Discrepancy Search (CDDS) method based on Johnsonâ€™s rule and on
dedicated lower bounds for the two-stage hybrid flow shop problem. We report the results of extensive
computational experiments, which show that the proposed adaptation of the CDDS method solves
instances in restrained CPU time and with high quality of makespan.

Many researchers have studied the issue of image defogging and enhancement, but there is no objective criterion to evaluate the defogging results. Based on the visual differences of images before and after defogging, valid edge intensity is defined to denote the detail performance of image, and color intensity in CIELAB color space is defined to denote the color performance of image. At last, the notions of detail restoration ratio and color restoration ratio are proposed, with which the effect of different defogging methods can be evaluated objectively. Experimental results prove the feasibility of our method.

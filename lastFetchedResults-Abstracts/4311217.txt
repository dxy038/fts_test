On-line optimization and control of fed-batch fermentation is difficult due to its non linearity and dynamic operation points with uncertainty. A novel cascade optimal control algorithm was proposed to treat these difficulties with the operating points, which maximize the objective function, was defined by Necessary Conditions of Optimization (NCO). Consequently, a nonlinear Generic Model Control (GMC) was applied to eliminate effect of uncertainty. Calculations of Hamilton gradient online and repeated optimization were avoided. The simulation on saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme cultivation process showed the efficiency and advantage of the proposed method.

This paper proposes an effective approach for planning a load transfer substation pair(LTSP) between two normally closed-loop feeders considering minimization of system power losses. Firstly, the annual equivalent load of each load point is calculated. Then, a genetic algorithm-based (GA-Based) approach has been proposed to solve this optimization problem. The objective is minimization of the annual system power losses. Finally, the optimal LTSP was chosen considering minimizing annual system power losses and the maximum voltage drops at each bus as well as ampere capacities of each feeder segment. The method presents in this paper are valuable to distribution engineers for planning the LTSPs between normally closed-loop feeders.

Objective To describe the epidemiology of echocardiographic mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and its anthropometric, physiologic, and psychobehavioral correlates with a cross-sectional analysis at 4 urban clinical centers. Patients  A biethnic, community-based sample of 4136 young (aged 23 to 35 years) adult participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who had echocardiograms during their third examination between 1990 and 1991. Measurements  Echocardiographic mitral valve prolapse, Doppler mitral regurgitation, blood pressure, anthropometry, and 4 psychobehavioral scales. Results  Definite echocardiographic MVP prevalence was 0.6% overall and was similar across the 4 ethnicity/sex groups. Most participants (21 of 26, 80%) with definite echocardiographic MVP were unaware of their condition. Relative to persons with normal echocardiograms, those with echocardiographic MVP were taller (174.6 cm vs 171.0 cm, P < .01), leaner (26.7 mm vs 37.4 mm sum of triceps and subscapular skinfolds, P < .01), had lower body mass index (22.0 kg/m2 vs 26.2 kg/m2, P < .01), and more often has Doppler mitral regurgitation (34.8% vs 11.8%, P < .01). Women with echocardiographic MVP had higher ethnicity-adjusted hostility scores (19.9 vs 16.1, P  < .05) than women with no MVP. Among 111 (2.7%) of 4136 participants reporting prior physician diagnosis of MVP, only 5 (0.45%) of 111 had definite echocardiographic MVP. Conclusions  These data document a low prevalence of definite echocardiographic MVP and suggest a constellation of anthropometric, physiologic, and psychobehavioral characteristics in young adults with echocardiographic MVP. Most definite echocardiographic MVP diagnoses were discordant with self-reported MVP status, and false-positive diagnoses of echocardiographic MVP were made more often in women and whites.

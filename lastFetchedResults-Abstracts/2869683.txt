A novel control scheme for three-phase PWM rectifier is proposed in the paper which improves variable-frequency hysteresis-current control and space vector control due to the fact that there are common shortcomings in the traditional hysteresis controlling method. Compared with traditional current hysteresis control and space-vector control methods, the improving variable-frequency hysteresis and SVPWM control can reduce the delay of control time significantly. The Matlab/Simulink simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and provide with super advantages such as reducing harmonic pollution, lowering switching frequency, accelerating dynamic response and so on. This makes it vital to build a highly effective control system and regulate widespread application for three-phase PWM rectifier which contributes to energy conversion and bidirectional flow of electricity.

This paper presents a control scheme of single phase to three phase converters for low power three phase induction motor drives, with reduced number of switching devices. Here a single phase half-bridge PWM rectifier and two-leg inverter are used with the same function that are all given by conventional one such as sinusoidal input current, unity power factor, bidirectional power flow, dc-link voltage control. Hence the number of switching devices is reduced from ten to six. A current controller is introduced for two-leg inverter. In addition, the source voltage sensor elimination technique is presented which makes the system cheaper. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by experimental results for the V/ f control of 3-HP induction motor drives with FPGA based controller.

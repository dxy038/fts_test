A fast Tausworthe-type random number generator has been implemented as a VLSI circuit on silicon for Monte-Carlo simulation purposes in a parallel multiprocessor system environment. The generator, which has uniform distribution, has been constructed for use as a peripheral device to be connected with each processor unit. General considerations for parallel random number generation are discussed and desirable properties are reviewed as a starting point for a VLSI implementation. The hardware design is based on the maximal length shift register sequences. It involves concurrent architecture in which a single shift operation is equivalent to 16 shifts in the original shift register unit. A new 16-bit random number is generated during each shifting operation. The chip is fully microprocessor bus compatible with a 16-bit bidirectional data bus and three I/O control lines. The methods of shift register sequence segmentation are also reviewed. Practical aspects for parallel processing system purposes are given. The generator has been submitted to a comprehensive set of statistical tests.

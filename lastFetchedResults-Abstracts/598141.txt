Local authorities nowadays are faced with many challenges in running their business with rapid development in social, economic and politics as well. The ability to overcome current issues and the readiness to face future challenges are estimated differently between one local authority and another. Local authorities whom are equipped with strong finance, visionary leadership, systematic strategic and action planning and public support will definitely be more prepared to face those challenges. On the other hand, weaker local authorities in financial and effective administration may be faced with problems in its area. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the level of issues and challenges facing the council which served the public and the approach applied to this study. Several major findings were obtained from the use of a set of questionnaire on the issues and challenges of local authorities in Malaysia, by referring to Seberang Perai Municipality Council as a case study, and some information in the questionnaires were handed over to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (MHLG). Thus, few recommendations were proposed to its council in designing better approach to public service. In future research, the local government should be firm in addressing issues and challenges by having good instrument to be measured in their core business. The council should have close relationship with the stakeholders such as the government, non government organizations (NGO's), business communities and public as well, to deal with continuous issues and challenges in local affairs at large.

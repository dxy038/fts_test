Background: The objective of the research work is to assess day time traffic noise level at curbside open-air
microenvironment of Kolkata city, India under heterogeneous environmental conditions.
Results: Prevailing traffic noise level in terms of A-weighted equivalent noise level (Leq) at the microenvironment
was in excess of 12.6 ± 2.1 dB(A) from the day time standard of 65 dB(A) for commercial area recommended by the
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India. Noise Climate and Traffic Noise Index of the microenvironment
were accounted for 13 ± 1.8 dB(A) and 88.8 ± 6.1 dB(A) respectively. A correlation analysis explored that prevailing
traffic noise level of the microenvironment had weak negative (?0.21; p  <  0.01) and very weak positive (0.19; p  <  0.01)
correlation with air temperature and relative humidity. A Varimax rotated principal component analysis explored that
motorized traffic volume had moderate positive loading with background noise component (L90, L95, L99) and
prevailing traffic noise level had very strong positive loading with peak noise component (L1, L5, L10). Background and
peak noise component cumulatively explained 80.98 % of variance in the data set.
Conclusions: Traffic noise level at curbside open-air microenvironment of Kolkata City was higher than the standard
recommended by CPCB of India. It was highly annoying also. Air temperature and relative humidity had little influence
and the peak noise component had the most significant influence on the prevailing traffic noise level at curbside
open-air microenvironment. Therefore, traffic noise level at the microenvironment of the city can be reduced with
careful honking and driving.

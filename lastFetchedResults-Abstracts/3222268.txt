In this paper, assist-control of crane system for human operator is considered. The objective of this paper is to achieve easy operating with less sway. In previous work, it is proved that force feedback is effective to operate crane system. To improve the previous work, force feedback system with Lyapunov based controller is proposed. The effectiveness of Lyapunov based controller was proved in automatic control. Assisted force is inserted in the master system, therefore operator can feel how to control master system to reduce oscillation. Experimental results shows that better design of the automatic anti-sway control improve human-machine interaction.

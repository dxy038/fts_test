We present a novel algorithm for detecting seasonal soil freezing processes using L-band microwave radiometry. L-band is the optimal choice of frequency for the monitoring of soil freezing, due to the inherent high contrast of the microwave signature between the frozen and thawed states of the soil medium. Dual-polarized observations of L-band brightness temperature at a range of observation angles were collected from a tower-based instrument, and evaluated against ancillary information on soil and snow properties over four winter seasons. During the first three winter periods the measurement site was located over mineral soil on a forest clearing, for the fourth winter the instrument was moved to a wetland site. Both sites are located in Sodankylä, Northern Finland. The test sites represent two environments typical for the northern boreal forest zone. The data were applied to derive an empirical relation between the onset and progress of soil freezing and the observed passive L-band signature. A retrieval algorithm was developed using the observations at the forest opening site. The algorithm exploits the perceived change in brightness temperature and the change in the relative difference between the signatures at horizontal and vertical polarization. With the collected experimental dataset, these features were linked optimally to the progress of soil freezing by choice of observation angle, polarization and temporal averaging. The wetland site observations provided the first opportunity for demonstrating the developed algorithm over a different soil type, giving a first estimate of the algorithm performance over larger heterogeneous targets. The future objective is to adapt the algorithm to L-band satellite observations. The present study is highly relevant for the development of freeze–thaw algorithms from current and future L-band satellite missions such as SMOS and SMAP.

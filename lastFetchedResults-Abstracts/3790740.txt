In this paper the security and the economy aspects of reactive power scheduling are emphasized and an automatic optimization procedure suitable for large scale systems is presented. Two objective functions have been implemented; the first one, based on security, distributes the reactive power generation among the units as proportional as possible to their ratings. The second one minimizes tle active losses expressed in terms of the reactive control variables. In both these optimization problems the control variables are partitioned into two subsets:-the terminal voltages at the generation buses-the LTC transformer tap settings.

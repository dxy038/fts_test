Objective: Leishmaniasis is one of the significant causes of morbidity and mortality in several countries. It is an important problem in endemic areas such as Iran. The goal in treatment of leishmaniasis is to reduce the disease period and leave no evidence of any remaining scars or lesions. A derivative of artemisinin is artemether. Scientists believe that the strong action of artemether against parasites is due to the presence of an endoperoxide bridge. Due to problems in the treatment of Leishmania major, in this research we have studied the effect of artemether on Leishmania major under in vitro conditions.
Methods: Parasites were cultured in NNN and RPMI, after which artemether at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 ?g/ml were used for the promastigote assay. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and DNA ladder assay.
Results: The inhibitory concentration (IC50) of artemether was determined to be 25 ?g/ml. The percentage of apoptotic promastigotes at 25 ?g/ml of artemether was 42.28. The results of DNA fragmentation show that exposure of Leishmania major promastigote cells to 25 ?g/ml of artemether lead to DNA fragmentation.
Conclusion: We have proven the effect of artemether on apoptosis of Leishmania major by flow cytometry and the DNA ladder assay.

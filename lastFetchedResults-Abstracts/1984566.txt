Cleaner production and sustainability are of crucial importance in the field of machining processes where great amount of energy is being consumed. This paper outlines the application of grey relational theory and Taguchi optimization methodology in order to optimize the cutting parameters for PolyEtherEtherKeytone reinforced with 30% of carbon fibers. The material is turned by using TiN coated tools under dry conditions. The objective of optimization is to achieve simultaneously the minimum power consumption and the best surface quality. This involves in practice reducing the environmental footprint related to such manufacturing process while providing enhanced functional performance in terms of surface integrity of machined parts. The obtained results have indicated that cutting speed and depth of cut are the most influential parameters. The optimal setting of machining parameters achieving sustainability target in terms of minimum surface roughness and minimum cutting power was determined.

The objective of this paper is to present and validate an improved formulation of the hydraulic network equations that incorporate pressure-dependent leakage in Water Distribution Systems. The formulation is derived from the Navierâ€“Stokes equations and solved using an adequate splitting method. An implicit numerical scheme is used to solve the p -Laplacian equation. The model is validated on a benchmark pipe network.

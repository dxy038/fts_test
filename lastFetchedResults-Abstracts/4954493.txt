FluidDB is a new structured storage system, available online for limited alpha test, which is designed to be able to easily store objects and relations among them (using tags). It is accessible through a simple REST interface, which is usually wrapped in a high-level language library. These features make them an ideal candidate for acting as the substrate of a persistent or pool based evolutionary algorithm, the Fluid Evolutionary Algorithm, presented for the first time in this paper. Our objective is to present a proof of concept and also to show how design decisions (about how and how often to use the pool, for instance) affect running time and algorithmic performance; we also show how FluidDB features positively affect algorithm design. These measures are mainly intended as a baseline measure, which can be improved on as FluidDB and fluid evolutionary algorithms (co-)evolve.

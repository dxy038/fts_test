The role and importance of security in every society's progress is so great that many consider it the platform of any development. Especially, in developing countries with a variety of crises and the ongoing challenges of backwardness, instability, and different political structures that they are facing, social security plays an important role in development. Sense of security is more important than security. Sense of security is as important as the safety in the community. In fact, sense of security is considered as a combination of individual, psychological, and social factors. Security is viewed as the objective dimension and the feeling of security as the subjective dimension of the matter. The purpose of this research is to study women's sense of security in the city of Amol and the social factors related to it. The research method is descriptive-explanatory, and for data collection, the survey method and a researcher-made questionnaire were used. The results showed that the relationship between individual characteristics (age, education, income, class, and marital status) and sense of security is not significant. There is a significant direct relationship between sense of security and place of residence, between government-induced security and sense of security, and between social trust and feeling of security. Therefore, the relationship between sense of security and personal characteristics is rejected, and the relationship between sense of security and social trust at intermediate and macro levels is accepted with the maximum significance.

This paper investigates the insulation coordination study for the Nba Be-Tao Dan 220 kV cable line that will be installed in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The main objective of the study for this cable line is to determine the overvoltage levels caused by lightning and switching. In order to study the overvoltages, modeling of components of this system such as overhead lines, underground cables, arresters and towers is presented. The simulations were carried-out using EMTP

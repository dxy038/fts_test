Objective (s): The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between human development and mortality of under five children in Iran during 1981 to 2011.
Methods: The ordinary least square regression analysis was used to identify the causal relationship between human development index and mortality rate of under-five years children during the study period. The required data for analysis were collected from the Iranian Statistical Center, the World Bank and the United Nations Human Development Reports.
Results: The results showed that there was a negative and meaningful relationship between human development index and mortality rate of under-five years children during the study period. Moreover, the analysis showed that there was a positive and meaningful relationship between mortality of under-five years children and inflation rate, unemployment level and Gini coefficient for income distribution. 
Conclusion: Socio-economic programs conducted by the government should basically focus on education, income distribution, employment and health status aiming to improve the human development index and thereby decrease mortality rate among under five years children in Iran.

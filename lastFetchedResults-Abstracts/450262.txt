Objective
To decribe the human corneal hitopathology after laer in itu keratomileui, photorefractive keratectomy, atigmatic keratoplaty, clear corneal refractive len urgery, conductive keratoplaty, and intratromal corneal ring egment placement.
Deign
Retropective hitopathologic tudy and elected literature review.
Method
Ninety-four potmortem cornea from 49 patient and 10 corneal button pecimen from 6 patient with previou refractive urgery were collected from eye bank and refractive urgeon in North America. Thi obervational cae erie evaluated the pathologic finding in the wound of thee cornea in the context of previou tudie.
Reult
Three hitopathologic type of corneal wound-healing repone were preent in cornea after refractive urgery. The firt wa an epithelial cell modification that reetablihed a mooth anterior corneal urface through baal epithelial cell hypertrophy, by epithelial hyperplaia, or both. The econd wa the production of a hypercellular fibrotic tromal car, and the third wa the production of a hypocellular primitive tromal car. Although only the hypercellular fibrotic tromal car could be identified on gro examination, all three wound repone were identified with light, electron, and immunofluorecence microcopy. Confocal microcopy alo identified thee three procee but with le detail and reolution.
Concluion
Undertanding the location, clinical appearance, and functional attribute of thee wound-healing repone will help guide evolving technique or adjunctive treatment.

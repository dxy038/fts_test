In Japan Eastern 50 Hz the power system, there are two PMUs (Phasor Measurement Unit) are installed between Hachinohe and Yokohama. The main objective of this paper is to present a monitoring and estimation of small disturbance angle stability of power system based on application practices of the CampusWAMS in Japan eastern 50 Hz. This scheme focuses on single dominant inter-area oscillation mode and the FFT filter technique is employed to separate aimed single oscillation mode from other modes. Then, the eigenvalue coming from the observation PMU data is a powerful tool to investigate inter-area oscillations in large power systems as it indicates the dynamic properties of the whole system. Finally, long term oscillated features and variations of phasor before and after the Great Eastern Japan earthquake are analyzed using the acquired data.

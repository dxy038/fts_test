This paper is in support of a recent Phase Matrix, Inc. (PMI) Phase I Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) investigative study. The objective of this SBIR initiative was to assess the feasibility of developing a radio frequency/microwave (RF/MW) down converter in a small form factor format called PXI (PCI Extension for Instrumentation) for use in a synthetic instrument measurement context over a target frequency range of DC to 26.5 GHz. The paper opens with an introductory overview of the subject, purpose and scope of this project initiative. The paper then provides the reader background /introductory information on the significance of the problem being addressed by this research, an overview of synthetic instrumentation technology, and addresses the challenges and opportunities afforded by employing PXI technology in the context of a RF/MW SI application. The paper then describes the technical objectives of the Phase I research and the associated issues which needed to be resolved in order to establish project feasibility. In the summary of results section of the paper, the authors provide an overview of the PXI 3U functional partitioning approach adopted as a result of their investigative studies and provides a brief discussion of a family of five (5) down converter modules which can be configured into various configurations for dual use (commercial &amp; military) application. The paper then concludes with a summary overview of the conclusions arrived at as a result of the authors* Phase I feasibility investigations as well as Phase II (prototype development) next steps.

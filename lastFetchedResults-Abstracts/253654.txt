Proteins potentially inhibitory to the growth of grainmoulding
fungi in vitro have been identified from sorghum
seeds. However, their role in vivo during fungi
infection is still not clear. The objective of the present
study was to evaluate the presence of antifungal proteins
(AFPs) during grain development. Suren˜o (a
grain mould-resistant line), RTx430 (a grain mouldsusceptible)
and their F1 hybrid, were planted at two
moisture levels. Caryopses were collected from each
genotype every 7 days after anthesis (DAA) during
development and maturity of the grain. Significant levels
of grain mould occurred naturally. Levels of four
AFPs (sormatin, chitinases, b-1,3-glucanases and ribosomal-
inactivating proteins) were determined using the
immunoblotting technique. During grain development
(7–35 DAA), Suren˜ o and the F1 hybrid showed higher
levels of sormatin and chitinase than RTx430. RIPs
levels in Suren˜ o and the F1 hybrid were higher than
those in RTx430 after 21 DAA. Sormatin, chitinases,
b-1,3-glucanases and RIPs levels in Suren˜ o and in the
F1 hybrid were higher than those of RTx430 after
grain physiological maturity. AFPs are associated with
grain mould resistance because Suren˜ o and the F1
hybrid induce and/or retain higher AFPs levels under
grain mould infection pressure than did RTx430.

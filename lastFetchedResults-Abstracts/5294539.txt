We propose a distributed security architecture for incorporation into object oriented distributed computing systems, and in particular, into OMGÂ´s CORBA based object architectures. The primary objective of the security architecture is to make CORBA resilient to both component failures and malicious attacks. The core of the architecture is the notion of secure ORB node-an ORB node enhanced with &#8220;pluggable&#8221; system security objects interacting through generic security service APIs. System security objects coupled with protocols among them facilitate creation and management of clients, objects, and security information. Security services addressed in the paper include, but are in no way limited to, client/object authentication, access control, and integrity and confidentiality protections

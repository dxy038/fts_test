Objective
Since it was first described, normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and its treatment by means of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting have been the focus of much investigation. Whatever be the cause of NPH, it has been hypothesized that in this disease there occurs decreased arterial expansion and an increased brain expansion leading to increased transmantle pressure. We cannot measure the latter, but fortunately the effect of these changes (increased peak flow velocity through the aqueduct) can be quantified with cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This investigation was thus undertaken to characterize and measure CSF peak flow velocity at the level of the aqueduct, before and after lumbar CSF drainage, by means of a phase-contrast cine MRI and determine its role in selecting cases for shunt surgery.
Patients and methods
37 patients with clinically suspected NPH were included in the study. Changes in the hyperdynamic peak CSF flow velocity with 50 ml lumbar CSF drainage (mimicking shunt) were evaluated in them for considering shunt surgery.
Results
14 out of 15 patients who were recommended for shunt surgery, based on changes peak flow velocity after lumbar CSF drainage, improved after shunt surgery. None of the cases which were not recommended for shunt surgery, based on changes in CSF peak flow velocity after lumbar CSF drainage, improved after shunt surgery (2 out of 22 cases).
Conclusion
The study concluded that the phase-contrast MR imaging, done before and after CSF drainage, is a sensitive method to support the clinical diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus, selecting patients of NPH who are likely to benefit from shunt surgery, and to select patients of NPH who are not likely to benefit from shunt surgery.

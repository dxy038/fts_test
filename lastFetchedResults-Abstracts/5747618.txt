A new singularity analysis method for a general 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) Stewart platform using genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed in the paper. The Jacobian matrix of the Stewart platform is first deduced, then the square of determinant of the Jacobian matrix is selected as the objective function, and the minimum of this objective function is searched in the workspace of the Stewart platform by a real-coded GA. The singularity of the Stewart platform depends on this minimum objective function, if this value is zero, the singularity of Stewart platform will happen, otherwise, the Stewart platform is singularity-free. The effectiveness of this new genetic singularity analysis method is validated by numerical simulation.

Multistage distribution network expansion because of load growth is a complex problem in distribution planning. The problem consists of minimizing total cost of objective function subject to technical constraints. Additionally, the reliability requirements of customers should be optimally satisfied. In this paper, HV/MV substations, main and reserve MV feeders, DG sources and storage units are considered as possible solutions for multistage distribution expansion planning. Some strategies are proposed for DG and storage units operation to optimize the distribution planning. A modified PSO algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problem. Numerical results of the case studies show ability of the methodology.

In this paper we use the penalty approach in order to study minimization problems with mixed constraints in Banach spaces. A penalty function is said to have the generalized exact penalty property if there is a penalty coefficient for which approximate solutions of the unconstrained penalized problem are close enough to approximate solutions of the corresponding constrained problem. In this paper we show that the generalized exact penalty property holds and is stable under perturbations of objective functions, constraint functions and the right-hand side of constraints.

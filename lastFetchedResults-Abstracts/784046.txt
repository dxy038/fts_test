Objective Childhood externalizing behavior is found to
be relatively persistent. Developmental pathways within
types of externalizing behavior have been recognized from
childhood to adolescence. We aimed to describe the prediction
of adult DSM-IV disorders from developmental
trajectories of externalizing behavior over a period of
24 years on a longitudinal multiple birth cohort study of
2,076 children. This has not been examined yet.
Methods Trajectories of the four externalizing behavior
types aggression, opposition, property violations, and status
violations were determined separately through latent
class growth analysis (LCGA) using data of five waves,
covering ages 4–18 years. Psychiatric disorders of 1,399
adults were assessed with the CIDI. We used regression
analyses to determine the associations between children’s
trajectories and adults’ psychiatric disorders.
Results All externalizing behavior types showed significant
associations with disruptive disorder in adulthood. In
all antisocial behavior types high-level trajectories showed
the highest probability for predicting adult disorders. Particularly
the status violations cluster predicted many disorders
in adulthood. The trajectories most often predicted
disruptive disorders in adulthood, but predicted also anxiety,
mood, and substance use disorders.
Conclusions We can conclude that an elevated level of
externalizing behavior in childhood has impact on the longterm
outcome, regardless of the developmental course of
externalizing behavior. Furthermore, different types of
externalizing behavior (i.e., aggression, opposition, property
violations, and status violations) were related to different
adult outcomes, and children and adolescents with
externalizing behavior of the status violations subtype were
most likely to be affected in adulthood.

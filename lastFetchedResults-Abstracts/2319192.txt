The results showed that there was a meaningful statistical relationship between the state anxiety and having a second job (P= 0.006), number of children (P=0.05). In addition, there was a meaningful statistical relationship between the trait anxiety and having second job (P=0.01), genetic variant (P=0.04), marital status (P=0.02). Moreover, there was a significant correlation between the different dimensions of quality of life with employment status (P=0.03), second job (P=0.01), and car ownership (P=0.005).

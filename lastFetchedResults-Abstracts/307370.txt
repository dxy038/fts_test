Objective
Evaluate the performance of the new pretreatment (NPT) reagent for use with the EMIT® cyclosporine A (CsA) assay.
Design and methods
Samples from transplant patients receiving CsA were tested using a COBAS MIRA S®.
Results
A downward shift in target values for commercial controls was observed using the NPT reagent. There was excellent correlation for patient results when comparing the NPT reagent with methanol pretreatment.
Conclusion
The NPT reagent is an acceptable substitute for methanol in the EMIT® extraction procedure for CsA.

We present final results of the German research project EURoPAK, whose main objective was the development of a remote sensing technique for surface current fields and underwater bathymetry on the basis of conventional and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR and InSAR). In May 2001, the second of two field experiments with an airborne along-track InSAR was carried out over a test site in the North Sea, where scientists of the GKSS Research Center performed simultaneous in-situ measurements with a variety of instruments within the framework of another project. We describe data processing procedures, show examples of measured current fields and bathymetric maps, and discuss the quality of our results and the potential of the INSAR technique for operational services such as routine monitoring of bathymetric changes.

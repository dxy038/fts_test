The objective of this study was to compare the growth, slaughter and carcass characteristics
of Alpine × Hair goat (first cross) (AH), Saanen × Hair goat (first cross) (SH), and Hair goat
(H) male kids fed with concentrate in addition to grazing on the natural pasture. Seven
kids per breed group (a total of 21 kids) at approximately 3.5 months of age were fed
300 g/day/animal concentrate in addition to grazing on rangeland for 70 days. The kids were
kept in the natural pasture accompanied by a shepherd throughout the day, except pen rest
to avoid the midday heat outside for 1–2 h. The concentrate was given after returning from
grazing at the end of the day. All lambs were slaughtered at the end of the 70 days period.
Least squares means of the final live weights of AH, SH and H kids were 32.7, 33.6 and
28.9 kg (P < 0.01), respectively. Total and daily live weight gains were 9.2, 9.8 and 6.7 kg
(P < 0.05), and 0.13, 0.14 and 0.09 kg (P < 0.05) for the AH, SH and H kids, respectively. Cold
carcass weight and dressing percentage of AH, SH and H groups were 12.9, 13.3 and 11.1 kg
(P < 0.01), and 39.4, 40.5 and 38.5% (P < 0.05), respectively. Internal fat weight of AH, SH
and H kids were 0.06, 0.06 and 0.03 kg (P < 0.05), respectively. M. Longissimus dorsi (MLD)
area between the 12th and 13th ribs of AH, SH and H kid carcasses were 10.5, 11.5 and
8.9 cm2 (P < 0.05), respectively. The liver (P < 0.05), kidney (P < 0.01) and internal fat (P < 0.05)
percentages of the kid carcasses were significantly different among groups. In this study,
the total and daily live weight gain, dressing percentage and several carcass characteristics
were found to be different among genotype groups. Results suggest that Alpine and Saanen
breeds could be used to improve the productivity of Hair goat kids fed with concentrate in
addition to grazing on rangeland

Estimates of growing stock volume are reported by the national forest inventories (NFI) of most countries and may serve as the basis for aboveground biomass and carbon estimates as required by an increasing number of international agreements. The probability-based (design-based) statistical estimators traditionally used by NFIs to calculate estimates are generally unbiased and entail only limited computational complexity. However, these estimators often do not produce sufficiently precise estimates for areas with small sample sizes. Model-based estimators may overcome this disadvantage, but they also may be biased and estimation of variances may be computationally intensive. For a minor region within Hedmark County, Norway, the study objective was to compare estimates of mean forest growing stock volume per unit area obtained using probability- and model-based estimators. Three of the estimators rely to varying degrees on maps that were constructed using a nonlinear logistic regression model, forest inventory data, and lidar data. For model-based estimators, methods for evaluating quality of fit of the models and reducing the computational intensity were also investigated. Three conclusions were drawn: the logistic regression model exhibited no serious lack of fit to the data; estimators enhanced using maps produced greater precision than estimates based on only the plot observations; and third, model-based synthetic estimators benefit from sample sizes for larger areas when applied to smaller subsets of the larger areas.

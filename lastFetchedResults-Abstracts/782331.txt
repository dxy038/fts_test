The objective of this experiment was to study the effect of inorganic, organic and elemental
nano-selenium on growth performance, Se concentration and antioxidant status in growing
male goats. A total of 40 weaned Taihang black goats were randomly divided into four
equal groups, given the basal diet either unsupplemented (CTRL only received 0.03 mg/kg
Se background) or supplemented with 0.3 mg/kg Se as sodium selenite (SS), Se-yeast (SY) or
elemental nano-selenium (NS) for a 90 days experiment (from weaning to maturity). Average
initial and finial body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) were recorded. Serum
and whole blood were collected for serum glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide
dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) activity and Se content analysis.
At the end of the feeding trail five bucks in each group were killed and samples of heart,
liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle and testis were collected for Se determination. The result
showed that the finalBWwas increased (P < 0.05) in bucks supplemented with Se compared
to the controls, and ADG in NS and SY were greater (P < 0.05) than SS or CTRL bucks. Whole
blood, serum and tissue Se concentration, serum antioxidant enzymes activity were also
affected by dietary Se supplementation. Serum GSH-Px, SOD and CAT in NS were higher
(P < 0.05) than those in SS and SY, and Se retention of whole blood, serum and some organs
in NS were also higher than SS or SY (P < 0.05). It could be concluded that supplementation
of Se can improve growth performance, serum oxidant status and Se concentration in blood
and tissues in growing male goat. The dietary supplementation of elemental nano-Se could
be utilized more effectively when compared to inorganic or organic Se.

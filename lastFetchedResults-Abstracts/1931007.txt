The objective of this investigation was to examine the effects of 6-methoxy-benzoxazolinone (MBOA), a plant compound that resembles melatonin and alters ovarian function in rodents, in combination with PMSG on superovulatory responses in the cycling ewe. In Experiment I, St. Croix White ewes (n = 44) were synchronized (intra-vaginal progestin sponge) for 14 days followed by hCG (750 IU) at 1 day after sponge removal (day 0). Ewes were assigned to one of six treatments administered on day −1: Control (no PMSG or MBOA; n = 7); PMSG (1000 IU i.m.; n = 7); Low MBOA (0.43 mg/kg i.m.; n = 7); High MBOA (1.15 mg/kg i.m.; n = 7); Low MBOA + PMSG (n = 8); High MBOA + PMSG (n = 8). In Experiment II, St. Croix White ewes (n = 24) were synchronized (progestin CIDR) for 14 days followed by hCG on day 1 after CIDR removal (day 0). Ewes were assigned to one of three treatments administered on day −1: Control (n = 8); PMSG (n = 8); Low MBOA + PMSG (n = 8). Laparoscopy was performed on day 9 to assess numbers of corpora lutea (CL) and visible follicles on each ovary. Blood samples were collected on day −13, −1, 0, 1, and days 6 or 7–12 for analysis of serum progesterone (P4) by RIA. Treatment groups receiving PMSG (alone or with MBOA) exhibited greater (P &lt; 0.05) serum concentrations of P4 post-synchrony than Control and MBOA-only groups. Ovulation rate was lower (P &lt; 0.05) for Control and MBOA-only treated ewes than ewes receiving PMSG. Ovulation rate in ewes treated with MBOA alone was similar (P &gt; 0.10) to Controls, and PMSG treatment alone did not differ (P &gt; 0.10) from MBOA + PMSG treatment. Ewes treated with PMSG alone did not differ (P &gt; 0.10) in follicle number from High MBOA + PMSG treated ewes, however, Low MBOA + PMSG treated ewes had greater numbers of follicles at day 9 (P &lt; 0.05) than the PMSG or High MBOA + PMSG groups in Experiment I; although, this was not replicated in Experiment II with numbers of follicles in the Low MBOA + PMSG group being similar (P &gt; 0.10) to PMSG alone. In summary, the addition of MBOA in combination with PMSG as part of a synchronization–superovuation protocol in the ewe did not increase ovulation rate.

The aim of the article is to describe the procedure for mixed topology-size optimization of tall guyed masts, seeking the minimal mast weight with stochastic genetic algorithms. Given the height, geometrical in-plan and bracing schemes of the mast, loading and material data, the optimization procedure renders the explicit design of the mast including dimensions of all mast elements, attachment points of the guys, distances of the guysâ€™ foundations from the mast, etc. The constraints of the problem include typical strength, slenderness, and local and global stability requirements according to the Eurocodes. The value of the objective function is obtained and all the constraints are checked via statical analysis with a finite element program. The influence of the guys on the behavior of the mast is modeled by linear springs. The design obtained may serve as a hint for more precise nonlinear dynamic analysis. This article provides the results of the optimization of a practical 50 m broadcasting antenna mast with two clusters of guys.

Previous work has demonstrated the potential for coordinated control of a group of generators in a manner that destabilizes other machines in the system, while maintaining (nearly) completely satisfactory performance within this control group, thereby achieving an anti-competitive objective. However, that analysis did not allow selective targeting of the area of the system experiencing the instability. The work refines the design technique to demonstrate that anti-competitive control can indeed selectively target competing generators. This is intended as evidence that the risk of predatory control is more severe than earlier analysis might have suggested, providing a cautionary note that an entity responsible for system security must have tools to guard against such behavior

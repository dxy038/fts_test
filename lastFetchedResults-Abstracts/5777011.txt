In this work the influence of interference single-mode He-Ne laser field on the ensemble of particles in suspension was studied. The zone of a suspension, illuminated with interfering beams, was projected by a microscope objective and spherical lens onto a large screen so that interference fringes and spatial distribution of particles could be easily observed and photographed. By the experiments conducted, the interferometric trapping of microparticles was observed at light power as low as &#8764;2 mW. The detailed theoretical analysis of the main properties of the trapping is presented.

An operation strategy for hydrogen storage in combination with stochastic energy sources is presented. The hydrogen storage can simultaneously be used for power smoothing and provide clean fuel for vehicles. The method is based on optimization of an objective function that takes into account electricity market conditions and penalties for not providing hydrogen and oxygen to the loads. Three case studies where wind is the primary energy source have been analyzed. Simulation results show that the hydrogen storage makes it possible to reduce wind power fluctuations, and at the same time take advantage of hourly variations in the electricity price. In isolated operation mode, utilization of excess heat from the fuel cell leads to a significant reduction of the usage of back-up generator. The results indicate that it is valuable to use optimization techniques for operation of hydrogen storage in connection with stochastic energy sources.

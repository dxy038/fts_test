A material removal control (MRC), model to achieve the optimal cutting rate control of a cutting tool during machining is established in this study, which can direct a project towards reaching maximal profit. This paper not only applies the material removal rate (MRR) into the objective function mathematically, but also implements the calculus of variations to resolve the cutting rate control problem comprehensively. In addition, a dynamic solution for the control of the MRR is proposed and the decision criteria for selecting the optimal solution are recommended. Moreover, the sensitivity analyses for decision variables of the optimal solution are discussed. This study provides an efficient tool for controlling the machining rate for production engineers in present-day manufacturing.

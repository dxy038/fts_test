Heilonggang area is an important grain, cotton and edible oil production base in Hebei Province, however, drought, water shortage, barren soil and salinity restrict the agricultural production of the area, therefore, great quantity of groundwater have been exploited to maintain the normal irrigation, leading to a series of ecological environmental problems such as land subsidence etc. Through the research and investigation, it is found that the current situation of agricultural planting structure does not suit spatial distribution pattern of soil and water resources in some counties (cities, districts) of the study area. Based on the remote sensing interpretation, field surveys and other data and with the application of GIS, an objective, quantitative analysis of agricultural planting structure and water and soil has been made, furthermore the agricultural planting structure optimization program in the study area has been put forward to provide a theoretical basis for agricultural regional planning.

Context There are no prospective population-based
studies examining predictive associations between childhood
bullying behavior and adult criminality.
Objective To study predictive associations between bullying
and victimization at age eight and adult criminal
offenses.
Design Nationwide birth cohort study from age 8 to
26 years.
Participants The sample consists of 5,351 Finnish children
born in 1981 with information about bullying and
victimization at age eight from parents, teachers, and the
children themselves.
Main outcome measures National police register information
about criminal offenses at age 23–26 years.
Results When controlled for the parental education level
and psychopathology score, bullying sometimes and
frequently independently predicted violent (OR 3.9, 95%
CI 1.9–7.9, p\0.001; OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.6–4.1, p\0.001,
respectively), property (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2–4.7, p\0.05;
OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.7, p\0.05), and traffic (OR 2.8,
95% CI 1.8–4.4, p\0.001; OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3–2.1,
p\0.001) offenses. The strongest predictive association
was between bullying frequently and more than five crimes
during the 4-year period (OR 6.6, 95% CI 2.8–15.3,
p\0.001) in adjusted analyses. When different informants
were compared, teacher reports of bullying were the
strongest predictor of adult criminality. In adjusted analyses,
male victimization did not independently predict adult
crime. Among girls, bullying or victimization at age eight
were not associated with adult criminality.
Conclusions Bullying among boys signals an elevated
risk of adult criminality

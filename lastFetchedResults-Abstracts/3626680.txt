The authors have exploited the ideas used in vector quantisation for error recovery of scalar quantised LSFs. The good performance of this method has provided high resistance of the LSFs to channel errors, outperforming other schemes by, possibly, a considerable margin. Better objective and subjective performances were obtained with this new method which obviates the need for more powerful FEC schemes for transmission over noisy channels.

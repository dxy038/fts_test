A strategic objective of the Educational Activities Board (EAB) of the IEEE is the reshaping of educational programs to help members prepare for careers and employment in a rapidly changing technical arena. The Educational Activities Board works with IEEE Sections to promote an awareness of the available educational resources and in planning educational programs. The IEEE encourages the involvement of its members with their student branches, pre-college programs and in explaining the role of the engineer in the community. In addition to numerous technical conferences hosted by the IEEE at the national and international levels, many technical books and periodicals are available to keep members abreast with the latest advances in electrical engineering research. The IEEE has a collection of video tapes on technical topics, publishes the IEEE Standards and provides multi-media self study courses. This presentation will cover the educational activities mentioned above. In addition, specific activities of the Education Chapter of the IEEE Orlando Section will be presented

Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore self-, peer-, and tutor assessment of performance in tutorials among medical students in a problem-based learning curriculum. Methods: 117 students enrolled in the third year of the Doctor of Medicine Program at Fudan University were recruited to participate in a study of self, peer, and tutor assessment. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from the assessment of PBL performance within the tutorial setting. Results: The students scored themselves and peer higher than their tutor. The Bland Altman plots showed both self and peer scores agreed well with tutor scores. However, the correlation between self and tutor scores, between peer-averaged and tutor scores, both showed no statistical significance. Conclusion: Self and peer assessment showed poor accuracy but they had the potential to enhance studentsÂ´ self- awareness, reflection ability, and their ability to evaluate.

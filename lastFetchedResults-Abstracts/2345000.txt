All design decisions consist of subjective and objective parts. The former is evident at initial stages, whereas the latter is apparent toward the end. This paper introduces a subjectiveâ€“objective spectrum to make explicit the composition of these two parts in design decisions and a synthesis design framework to support the smooth transition between them. This domain-independent framework has two components: for the subjective part, a preference-aggregation model accumulates multiple individual preferences into a single team preference to drive synthesis reasoning; for the objective part, a logic-based synthesis reasoning model systematically guides the designers in transforming abstract intents to concrete solutions.

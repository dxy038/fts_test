Genetic algorithms are generally used to solve NP-complete problems, which include the train scheduling problem. Train scheduling consists of finding optimal arrival, departure, and dwelling times at the train stations. The objective is to minimize the associated delay that is the waiting times at the station. In this paper, we present an application of genetic algorithms to a generic train scheduling problem. The necessary algorithmic solution is described together with some empirical observations about the performance of our train scheduling model. It is concluded that our model is able to produce useful results in terms of minimizing delays and producing optimal schedules

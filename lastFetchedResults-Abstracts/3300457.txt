This paper presents a simulation algorithm to calculate optimized coordinated trajectories of intelligent vehicles in a segment of road considering individual priority. The objective is to reduce travel time for each vehicle. The configuration of the road can be modeled regarding the number of lanes, direction preference and exclusivity. The calculation considers the main elements of the traffic system, such as topography of the lane, traffic rules and individual capacity of acceleration. A methodology to deal with priority is also proposed. Emergency vehicles can cross the traffic in a shorter time. Simulation tests to evaluate the algorithm are presented.

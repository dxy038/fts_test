OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether treatment with clomiphene citrate, which is estrogenic and antiestrogenic, affects the expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin in human periimplantation phase endometrium. STUDY DESIGN: Five healthy women were studied for two cycles each, a control and a treated (clomiphene 50 mg daily, days 5 through 9) cycle. A biopsy specimen of endometrial tissue was studied (8 to 10 days post luteinizing hormone surge) for immunohistochemical localization, Western analysis of E-cadherin with use of a highly specific monoclonal antibody to human E-cadherin, and determination of messenger ribonucleic acid for E-cadherin by reverse transcriptionâ€“polymerase chain reaction by use of oligonucleotide primers specific to E-cadherin and amplifying a 432 bp fragment. RESULTS: Luteal phase plasma progesterone levels were significantly higher in clomiphene cycles. E-cadherin was immunocytochemically present in endometrium of control and treated cycles with no apparent difference in staining intensity. Western blots revealed the presence of E-cadherin. It was relatively more abundant in clomiphene-treated than control cycles but not significantly different. The message for E-cadherin gene is expressed in endometrium of control (n = 5) and clomiphene cycles (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: E-cadherin and its gene transcripts are expressed in periimplantation phase endometrium and are not significantly affected by clomiphene treatment.

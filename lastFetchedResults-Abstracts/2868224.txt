The linear actuator presented in this paper is a core component of an electronically-controlled linear escapement mechanism. Its role is to unlock mechanical parts, its mover being used as a hammer. In this situation, the kinetic energy acquired by the mover at the position of the impact is a defining factor. The multiobjective optimisation presented in this paper targets the maximisation of said kinetic energy and the minimisation of the overall size of the actuator. In addition to the objective, the originality of this paper is that the control strategy as well as the behaviour of the guide of the mover are directly taken into account in the optimisation process.

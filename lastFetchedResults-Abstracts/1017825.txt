Objective (s): This paper presents the results of a study that examined the factor structure, divergent and convergent validity and reliability of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) amongst a sample of 195 Iranian patients with chronic persistent pain.
Methods: All participants completed a group of self-report measures including the Persian versions of TSK, pain severity, physical disability, depression, and catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy beliefs. The factor structure of the TSK was examined, using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.
Results: The results indicated that TSK is conceptualized within a two-factor model, namely “believed injury” and “activity avoidance”. Results also indicated that the TSK and its two subscales have good internal consistency and test-retest reliability (with a 7-14 days interval). The results of correlation analysis between TSK and its 2 subscales with measures of pain, disability, depression, catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy beliefs supported both the convergent and the divergent validity for the TSK and the two subscales.
Conclusion: The Persian version of TSK had satisfactory psychometric properties and can be administered amongst the Iranian population with chronic persistent pain.

This paper shows how to use state machines and systematic approaches to software modeling to help modeler to improve, verify and validate a Domain Analysis and also refine and improve enterprise business processes. The main objective of this approach is how to systematic got a DSL from a Domain Analysis which can be used code system respecting, all business rules without complex definitions or documents. Many problems of Computer Software Systems (CSS) are derived from a lack of its behavior specification in order to solve that problem, but even with a well defined system behavior, many business rules are not properly treated since formalization becomes on the design phase. This paper shows an approach on how to systematically refine domain analysis to consider all business rules. It considers a state machine which represent all aspects of the domain choice. The state machines use is based on user friendliness and formality.

Extensive areas of low lying coastal plains on Santiago Island, Republic of Cape Verde, are virtually devoid of natural vegetation. Of many introduced trees and shrubs, onlyAtriplexspecies have been found to thrive. Several plantations have been established during the past 15 years by the Cape Verde Government, FAO and other agricultural development groups. Results from these, together with local perceptions, indicate that although growth and survival are good, the primary objective of providing forage is not being met, owing to the unpalatability ofAtriplexto local stock. In recent field trials, severalAtriplexspecies showed good growth, but none were browsed and survival was quite poor, with onlyA. undulata(65%) andA. canescens(100%) exceeding 60% survival. Forage analysis identified high salt content in all species tested, and the highest protein content was found inA. glauca(16%),A. vesicaria(17%) andA. canescens(20%), which also had the lowest salt levels.Atriptex canescenswas identified as worthy of further introduction. An establishedA. halimusplantation that was observed to be browsed was compared to unbrowsed stands in terms of forage, soil and local drinking water analyses. Possible reasons for the unpalatability ofAtriplexto local stock and its resolution are discussed, along with the potential future ofAtriplexon the Cape Verde Islands.

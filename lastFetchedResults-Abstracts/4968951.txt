In this paper, we propose a new extension framework of multichannel audio coding based on temporal quantization of spatial information. In our previous study, multiple-audio-object signal can be encoded/decoded via prototypes of directional clustering for each audio object. This paper, first, pays attention to the fact that quantized information corresponds to the spatial image of each sound object, and is easily modified and operated by the end users. Next, as a novel application of the spatial image operation, we propose a new earphone leakage noise reduction method in which the mostly leaked sound object can be detected automatically based on the higher-order statistics, and eliminated. The effectiveness of the proposed CODEC is verified in the subjective evaluation, and leakage noise reduction method is assessed in the objective evaluation.

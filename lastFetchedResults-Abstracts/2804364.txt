This paper presents a self-optimizing solution for Mobility Load Balancing (MLB). The MLB-SON is performed in two phases. In the first, a MLB controller is designed using Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MO-PSO) which incorporates a priori expert knowledge to considerably reduce the search space and optimization time. The dynamicity of the optimization phase is addressed. In the second phase, the controller is pushed into the base stations to implement the MLB SON. The method is applied to dynamically adapt Handover Margin parameters of a large scale LTE network in order to balance traffic of the network eNodeBs. Numerical results illustrate the benefits of the proposed solution.

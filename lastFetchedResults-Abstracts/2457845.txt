Introduction & Objective: This finite elements study for the first time has investigated the pattern of strain distribution in bone around dental implants in one and two implant supported overdenture treatment planning in protrusive and laterusive movements, in order to choose the best plan biomechanically.
Materials & Methods: To simulate the dental- implant and the bone, with Catia software, Jaws 3-D design was designed and 100 Newton forces were applied to dental implant models in protrusive and laterusive movements. 
Results:  In the design of one implant, the highest amount of strain was observed in laterusive movement in the third cervical and buccal (4097 ?µ) and in the design of two implants the highest amount of strain in protrusive movement was observed in the apical third of the lin-gual surface of the bone around the implant (2435?µ) and in laterusive movement in the apical fifth of lingual and buccal surface of bone around the implant (1668 ?µ).
Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that the strain and stress in the single implant design is more than two implants design. These results suggest the use of single implants in patients with minimal chewing force and in occlusion with minimal lateral force.

CompX is a natural analog of the unknown luciferin of the bioluminescence earthworm Fridericia heliota. Given the difficulties of characterizing luciferin, the objective of this work was the quantum chemistry based structural and electronic characterization of CompX. A main feature of this molecule is a strong partially covalent OH⋯O ionic bond, with sigma bonding character, present in all CompX species. Atomic charge transfers involving this interaction determine the relative stability of all species. Moreover, this interaction is involved in an excited state intramolecular proton transfer leading to a phototautomerism reaction. Thus, the large Stokes shift observed for CompX is attributed to an enol → keto photoconversion.

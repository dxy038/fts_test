Objective: Our purpose was to create tables and graphs of ultrasonographically derived fetal growth parameters in longitudinally studied triplet gestations from a single center. Study Design: All triplet pregnancies managed by our division from 1987 through 1998 were identified. All had first-trimester dating sonograms and complete obstetric sonograms obtained by means of 3.5- or 5.0-MHz curvilinear transducers with freeze-freeze capability and on-screen calipers. Sonograms to assess fetal growth were obtained every 2 to 4 weeks, from 16 to 18 weeks’ gestation until delivery. Fetal parameters obtained with each sonogram included biparietal diameter; head circumference; bicerebellar diameter; abdominal circumference; femur, humerus, tibia, and fibula lengths; estimated fetal weight; and head circumference/abdominal circumference ratio. Regression analysis was performed with JMP and Cricket Graph software packages, and lines of best fit with 95% confidence intervals were generated. Results: A total of 443 ultrasonographic examinations were performed for 33 triplet pregnancies (99 fetuses). Each had between 3 and 6 sonograms obtained, all between 16 and 35 weeks’ gestation. Scatterplots of each of the fetal growth parameters against gestational age were created with regression lines of best fit and 95% confidence intervals. All growth parameters were dependent on gestational age. Conclusion: A comprehensive set of fetal growth measurements in triplets from the United States is now available and can be used to assess longitudinal fetal growth.

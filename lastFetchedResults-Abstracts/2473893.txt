BACKGROUND: The field of research was animal feed production, especially in sheep feeding. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was determination of nutrient composition and DM, OM and CP degradation parameters of grape and lime pomaces by in situ technique. METHODS: First, nutrient composition of pomaces and alfalfa (observer) including CP, PC, OM, NDF, Ash, TT and EE were determined by AOAC method. The DM, OM and CP degradability was obtained after (0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hour) by using 3 fistulated Talesh male cows. This experiment was analyzed with completely randomized block design. RESULTS: The OM, NDF and lignin of grape pomace were 96.3, 57.6 and 34.4 % respectively and CP, Fat and NFC of lime pomace were 9.2, 7.7 and 54.2 % respectively. The DM, OM and CP degradation (in 24 hour incubation) of the grape were 36.3, 39.6, 48.8 respectively and lime pomaces were 80.5, 82.0, 89.5 respectively (%DM). Also, DUP and MP (on maintenance) for grape, lime pomaces and alfalfa were 34.3, 3.0, 13.4 and 56.5, 47.7, 81.2 (g/Kg) respectively. CONCLUSION: Based on the nutrient composition, degradation DM, OM and CP parameters and MP of the experimental pomaces, they may be used as new sources of non-forages fiber and energy (in order of grape and lime pomaces) in ruminants feeding.

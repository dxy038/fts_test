An advanced approach for voltage control in distribution networks is introduced that allows the number of DERs (Distributed Energy Resources) connected to a distribution network to be increased. This contribution discusses the approach comprehensively with simulation results and guidelines for practical implementations. The methodology presented attains the objective of controlling the voltage in distribution networks with high shares of decentralized generation while maintaining a good compromise between simplicity and performance. Possibilities of implementation in a demonstration phase are also presented.

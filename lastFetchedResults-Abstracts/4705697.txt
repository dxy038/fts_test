The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the main measurement parameter for effectively diagnosing chronic disease and guiding cardio-fitness therapy. ECGs contaminated by noise or artifacts disrupt the normal functioning of the automatic analysis algorithm. The objective of this study is to evaluate a method of measuring the HCP variation in motion artifacts through direct monitoring. The proposed wearable sensing device has two channels. One channel is used to measure the ECG through a differential amplifier. The other is for monitoring motion artifacts using the modified electrode and the same differential amplifier. Noise reduction was performed using adaptive filtering, based on a reference signal highly correlated with it. Direct measurement of HCP variations can eliminate the need for additional sensors.

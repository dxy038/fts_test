The objective of this paper is to study the relationship between modernity and changes in family in general and examine the way and kind of changes within Tehran and the city of Tehran in particular. By using Parson's functional structuralist theory and Ingelhart's theory of cultural changes, family development has been empirically studied over three generations in Tehran.
The findings indicate that, firstly, the family in Tehran is undertaking fundamental changes. Secondly, not only the three generations within family vary with respect to the variables of education, occupation and aspirations, but also changes in some structural elements of family have moved from material values towards post-material ones.
The study shows that in the sphere of manners, joys and festival parties, family in this society is experiencing a modernistic process affected by the wider society. This gives us a new feature about the family in Tehran, influenced by the process of adaptation of changes in the new era.

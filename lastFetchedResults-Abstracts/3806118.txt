The main objective of this study was to demonstrate that the human body may be approximated by a uniform geometrical shape. A perfect conducting circular cylinder of radius of 0.25 m was reasonably considered to be the closest form of substitute for the human body in human effect investigations. To validate the model, continuous-wave measurements were performed at 10 GHz between two fixed terminals in an empty room along with the presence of an obstacle (human body or cylinder) moving in predetermined parallel and perpendicularly crossing paths with respect to the direct line of sight. Results indicate that there is a strong correlation between the human body and a perfect conducting cylinder. The results obtained will be of great interest for ray-tracing techniques that involve a human motion within indoor propagation channel.

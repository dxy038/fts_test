Background: Radiation-sensitive polymer gels are among the most promising
three-dimensional dose verification tools and tissue-like phantom developed to date.
Objective: The aim of this study is an investigating of percentage depth dose
enhancement within the gel medium with used of conformal distribution gold
nanoparticle as contrast agents by high atomic number material.
Methods: In this work the normoxic polymer gel dosimeter MAGICA tissueequivalence
was first theoretically verified using MCNPX Monte Carlo code and
experimentally by percentage depth dose curves within the gel medium. Then gold
nanoparticles (GNPs) of 50nm diameter with different concentrations of 0.1mM,
0.2mM, and 0.4mM were embedded in MAGICA gel and irradiated by 18MV photon
beam.
Results: Experimental results have shown dose increase of 10%, 2% and 4% in
0.1mM, 0.2mM and 0.4mM concentrations, respectively. Simulation results had good
agreement in the optimum concentration of 0.1mM. The largest error between experimental
and simulation results was equal to 9.28% stood for 0.4mM concentration.
Conclusion: The results showed that the optimum concentration of gold
nanoparticles to achieve maximum absorbed dose in both experimental and simulation
was 0.1 mM and so it can be used for clinical studies.

Deep-space Optical Terminals (DOT) is a concept for providing bi-directional communication between a spacecraft at planetary distances and ground. The objective is a system that delivers 10 times the data-rate of a state-of-the-art Ka-band system while putting a comparable mass and power burden on the spacecraft. Here we give an overview of the concept for the Ground Laser Receiver (GLR) terminal. We discuss the selection of telescopes, receiver optics, detectors, and electronics.

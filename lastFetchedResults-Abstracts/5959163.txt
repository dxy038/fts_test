Experience in doing practical work in science laboratory is considered as important aspect of the educational process. However, there are few factors such as time, safety and cost that hold certain experiments in schools from being conducted in the lab. Instruction using computer based training in education using computer supported virtual laboratory has been reported to provide many advantages over other learning techniques. In this paper, we discuss stages involved in the proposed conceptual framework as a guide to develop virtual laboratory for biology (VLab-Bio) which is divided into three phases namely: identifying research problem, design and develop VLab-Bio prototype and usability testing of the prototype. In the first phase we reported results of a preliminary study which shows that &#8220;Describe the application of knowledge on mitosis in cloning&#8221; is the learning objective to be focused as a content in VLab-Bio. In the second phase, we described the process involved in the framework to structure, plan and control the process of developing the VLab-Bio. In the third phase we suggested six items that will be used in the future usability testing. It is hoped that the proposed conceptual framework for developing VLab-Bio prototype will be workable as a guide for developing an educational software such as VLab-Bio.

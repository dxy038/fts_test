A method for fan-in ordering of commutative functions in combinational logic is described. The objective is to maximise the worst slack in a multislot timing analysis environment. The main contribution is the notion that the problem can be formulated as a bipartite matching problem, in which the minimum weight of any element is maximised. The advantage of the method is that it gives optimal results over a large range of delay models. The optimization problem can be solved exactly in <e1>O</e1>(<e1>n</e1><sup>2</sup>&#8730;<e1>n</e1> In <e1>n</e1>) time, where <e1>n</e1> is the number of commutative pins, and only <e1>n</e1> timing calculations are necessary

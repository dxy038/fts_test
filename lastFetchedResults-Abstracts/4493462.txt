The objective of this paper is to give a realistic overview of the current state of the art of intelligent systems in industry based on the experience from applying these systems in a large global corporation. It includes a short analysis of the differences between academic and industrial research, examples of the key implementation areas of intelligent systems in manufacturing and business, a discussion about the main factors for success and failure of industrial intelligent systems, an estimate of the projected industrial needs that may drive future applications of intelligent systems, and some ideas how to improve academic-industrial collaboration in this research area.

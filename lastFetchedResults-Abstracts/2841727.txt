By simulation, provide a quantitative cost-benefit study of various redundant solar configurations at Remote Off-Grid RBS (Radio Base Stations) to configure the best answer. As the objective of a solar array is to improve finance operational of the site, as demonstrated the application of traditional N+1 or 2N converter solutions are often not the best answer. Proper configuration and over-provisioning the array is the usual best answer given todayÂ´s power part reliability.

In this paper, nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization is used to design power system stabilizers, to improve power system small-signal stability, considering nonstructured perturbations. This approach is suited to solve the problem of the design of low order controllers using output feedback. Two objective functions associated to the concept of pseudospectra are used as performance indices. The method is applied to the design of controllers for a test system, with two power system stabilizers and the design robustness and performance are evaluated.

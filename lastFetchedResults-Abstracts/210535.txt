Background: Several studies have shown that the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such
as nirnodipine, nifedipine, and amlodipine have anticonvulsant effect in a range of animal models.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of nimodipine. nifedipine and
amlodipine on PTZ-induced seizure threshold with further comparison of results in mice.
Methods: In 2007, this experimental study was carried out in School of Veterinary Medicine of
Tabriz Islamic Azad University. Male NMRI mice were randomly divided into groups of ten
members. Mice were intraperitoneally pretreated with vehicle or dihydropyridines (0.5-20 mg/kg)
before the determination of intravenously PTZ-induced seizure threshold.
Findings: The PTZ seizure threshold was 33.4Â±0.42 mg/kg in control group. In animals pretreated
with nimodipine, nifedipine and amlodipine, the PTZ seizure threshold dose-dependently increased,
compared with vehicle group. Nimodipine and nifedipine were found to have the highest and lowest
anticonvulsant effects, respectively.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the dihydropyridine Ca2
+ channel blockers induce an
anticonvulsant activity probably via an antagonistic effect on voltage-gated Ca2
+ channels

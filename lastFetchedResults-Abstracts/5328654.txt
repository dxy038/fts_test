This paper deals with the routing optimization in IPV6 networks. It´s the key processes of traffic engineering and network planning. Routing optimization provides a means to balance the traffic load in the network with the goal to improve the quality of service. The main objective of our routing optimization procedures is the minimization of the end-to-end delay, which is the total time of an individual packet to transfer from source to destination node. By optimized one of router´s functions, this function is the packet classification. This work is done modify the packet classification operation in the router architecture by making it based on two tuples (source address and flow label) instead of the regular five tuples to classify the coming packets. Finally, to test and compare the performance of our algorithm, we used the network simulator NS-2,version 2.29. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm indeed helps to minimize the end-to-end delay as a result of router optimization.

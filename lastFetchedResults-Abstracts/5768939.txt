This paper is to apply a new fuzzy multi objective approach for locating undesirable facilities and hazardous materials. This paper considers a location problem for collecting hazardous materials with two fuzzy parameters in multi objective decision making (MODM) environment. There are two objects in proposed model, first one emphasizes on minimizing total transportation cost and fixed cost, second one accentuates on minimizing risks impacts of locating undesirable and hazardous materials. Two new assumptions have been considered in this paper as; 1) The possibility of distribution of hazardous materials in one area among some repelling facilities, and 2) The possibility of selection among different facilities capacities in potential locations.

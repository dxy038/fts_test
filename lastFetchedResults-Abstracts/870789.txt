In this paper, a variety of generalized bibasic hypergeometric transformation
formulae have been investigated with the objective of finding a multiple series
generalized Rogers]Ramanujan type of identity. It has been shown that some very
interesting new multiple series identities of the Rogers]Ramanujan type can be
found where there is more than one infinite product in which the terms in each
product advance in different powers of q.

Background and Objective: Prevention of physical instability of chocolate milk is an important challenge in the field of food science, particularly dairy technolohy. In this study, the effects of high-intensity ultrasound treatment on stability of cocoa particles in chocolate milk, with or without the presence of stabilizers, was investigated.
Materials and Methods: Chocolate milk was exposed to ultrasound (maximal nominal power 600 W at 20 kHz) at various levels of power intensity (24, 72 and 120 W), exposure times (2, 6 and 10 minutes) and temperatures (25, 45 and 65?C) for 30 days.  ?-carrageenan at concentrations of 0.000, 0.010, 0.015 and 0.020 %, with or without sugar (7.0% and 0.0%), was added to the samples.
Results: Increasing power intensity and exposure time led to a significant increase in  physical stability of the milk samples ? the milk phase volume decreased and the cacao  phase increased. Moreover, the phase separation and cacao particle sedimentation were effectively prevented in the treated samples (ultrasonic power 120W, exposure time 2 min, temperature 45?C, ?-carrageenan 0.02%, and sugar 7%) after 30 days of storage at 4?C, while phase separation and cacao particle sedimentation occurred in  the control sample (containing 0.040% ?-carrageenan). The findings also showed that sugar improved cacao milk stability. The milk phase volume in the presence of 0.02% ?-carrageenan, kept at a temperature of 45 ?C for 30 days, was less than that of samples kept at other temperatures.
Conclusion: Based on the findings of the present study, it seems that ultrasound  can increase the stability of cacao particles in milk. In addition, ultrasound treatment possibly degrades  the ?-carrageenan network, particularly at higher temperatures. Furthermore, cavitation, probably due to entrapment of air in the ?-carrageenan network, may weaken the gel network.

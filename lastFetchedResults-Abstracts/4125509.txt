This study proposes two methods for the optimal placement of flexible alternative current transmission system (FACTS) devices considering variations in demand and renewable generation output. The basic optimisation technique utilised is the differential evolution algorithm and the objective is to minimise the cost of generation. The static performance of the FACTS device is considered here. Simulation shows that with renewable generation present in the network, the system state at peak demand is not always the most suitable state to use for the determination of the optimal FACTS allocation. From this, techniques based on the Monte Carlo simulation are proposed to determine the location for which the operation of FACTS device gives highest benefit in terms of saving cost of conventional generation. These techniques collectively are called renewable uncertainty-based optimal FACTS allocation techniques. This study shows the effectiveness of the techniques in the determination of the optimal FACTS placement for networks with a high penetration of renewable generation.

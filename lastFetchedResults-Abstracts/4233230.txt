When selecting foundation at a cosmetics store, the main objective is determining which material color best suits the userÂ´s skin color. This is not an easy task without actually applying the foundation since the color observed in the case is not necessarily being the color once it is applied to the skin. We propose a foundation-applied skin color prediction method using an SVD-based artificial neural network. Using the trained network, we achieved 95% of the foundation-applied skin color within a 2-color difference in L*a*b* space

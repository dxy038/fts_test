A unified design approach based on fully utilizing the switch bandwidth in a dilated banyan network is proposed. The design method is based on a switch model called the fat-banyan model with the objective of achieving high performance at minimal cost. Previously proposed dilated banyan networks form a subclass of the fat-banyan model. In this paper we show that the stage dilation in the fat-banyan is a function of the cell loss rate at each stage, to ensure optimal dilation. Simulation results for cell loss probability and throughput are presented for the independent uniform traffic case. The performance of the fat-banyan as an output-buffered switch is also investigated

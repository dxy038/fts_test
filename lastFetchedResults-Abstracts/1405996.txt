The objective of this study was to examine the relative contributions of copula duration and sperm transfer to the inhibition of sexual receptivity of female Mediterranean fruit flies (Ceratitis capitata, Diptera: Tephritidae). Females choosing to remate had significantly fewer sperm in their spermathecae than females who chose not to remate. Duration of a femaleâ€™s first copulation did not affect her subsequent receptivity. Furthermore, on the first day following copulation significantly more females whose first mate was sterile and from a laboratory strain (sterile males transfer fewer sperm than wild males) chose to copulate than did females whose mate was fertile and recently derived from wild stock. Finally, we offer a synthesis of the available information on remating in this species, and suggest that while females are facultatively polyandrous, copula duration, sperm transfer and male accessory gland secretions act in succession to inhibit female receptivity.

Objective
luate fluoride release from dentine discs and study the effects of dentine tubule occlusion and erosion prevention of dentifrices containing fluoride and PVM/MA copolymers in a cycling erosive challenge model.
s
dentine discs, 15 in each group, were eroded by 1.0% citric acid and treated by ProNamel® (PRN, 1450 ppm fluoride), Colgate® Total Sensitive (CTS, 1100 ppm fluoride), a prototype dentifrice containing 5000 ppm fluoride and 2% PVM/MA copolymers (PVD) and distilled water (control). Fluoride release from each dentine disc was evaluated every 2 h in a 12-h period. For cycling erosive challenges, dentine discs were treated by dentifrice slurries twice daily, followed by immersion in saliva and erosive challenges by orange juice. Dentine discs were stored in saliva between treatment cycles and the cycling erosive challenges were repeated for 15 days. On days 5, 10, and 15, size of dentine tubule openings and level of dentine tubule occlusion were evaluated with a 3D scanning microscope.
s
leased more fluorides than other dentifrices in a 12-h period (p &lt; 0.05). CTS released more fluorides than PRN at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h following a single application (p &lt; 0.05). The size of the dentine tubules was smaller and the number of occluded dentine tubules was greater in the CTS and PVD groups than those in the control and PRN groups on day 15 of the erosive challenges.
sion
esive PVM/MA copolymers facilitate fluoride retention and release from dentine discs, and promote dentine tubule occlusion and erosion prevention when combined with hydrated silica particles.

A novel method was presented to investigate the preparation of nutrient composite-soil by using biogas dreg-residue as raw material. The physical and chemical characteristics of the prepared composite-soil were systematically determined. The results suggested some parameters of the composite-soil (including the porosity, water content, bulk density, total N content (Tot-N), and total P content(Tot-P)) were superior to that of the check sample, the black soil. Henna was chosen as tested plant. And some important apparent parameter of the tested plant in the composite-soil, such as germination percentage, the average plant height, the average leaf length, and the average leaf breadth, were larger than that in the check sample, black soil.

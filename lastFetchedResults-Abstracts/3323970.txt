The main objective of this paper is to study the effects of variability in the position of the gates in Double-Gate Schottky-barrier MOSFETs by means of the Monte Carlo method. Taking a device with double gate and perfectly aligned contacts as a starting point, simulations were systematically performed to assess the impact of different types of gate misalignment that may appear. A complete picture of the problem is provided in relation to static device parameters, determining the influence of these factors on performance variability. Results manifest that SB-MOSFETs are extremely sensitive to gate misalignment, as, in extreme cases, drain current can reach relative variations up to 120%. This comes as a result of the carrier injection alterations when the gate potential positioning leads to fluctuations in the tunnel barrier which is at the source contact.

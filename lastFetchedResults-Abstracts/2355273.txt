This paper examines an approach that integrates the judgment and perceptions of coastal resource users in prioritizing the criteria and indicators for fisheries management impact evaluation. Five criteria with corresponding indicators were identified and selected namely, acceptability, biotic diversity, economic performance, enforceability, and equity. The weights of importance of criteria and indicators were determined through the Analytic Hierarchy Process applied in a case study with 23 resource user groups (categorized as fishers, local government unit, non-government organization, private sector and women) in San Miguel Bay, Philippines.

sults of this study revealed that overall, acceptability is the most important criterion in evaluating the impacts of fisheries management strategy in San Miguel Bay, especially for the local government units and fishers groups. The best measure of acceptability criterion are the indicators resource users participation in fisheries management process, level of awareness of resource users in fisheries resource management and number of fishers who belong to an organization. Ten groups have consistency ratios between 0.0 and 0.08 which are within the acceptable level of 0.10. Conversely, most groups (78%) have consistency ratios less than 0.26. Also, the results of the preference analysis are remarkable because among the representative groups, most fishers groups exhibited consistencies in their judgments (average consistency ratios of 0.06â€“0.08). Economic performance indicators were consistently judged across groups indicating that individuals present higher convergence of views toward economic objective.

Summary form only given.A continuing objective of research in optical communications is to increase the capacity of the installed standard fiber links by replacing the electronic repeaters with optical amplifiers and using time and wavelength multiplexing. For these fibers, at 40 Gbit/s per channel, the use of a dispersion compensation technique is needed. Since long spans of standard fiber (SF) are required, 75 km in our study, this can be easily done by inserting a dispersion-compensating fiber (DCF) before each amplifier and by using an optimal pre-chirp.

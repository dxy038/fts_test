Increasing demand for livestock products, together with changes in international trade, is placing pressure on the livestock sector both to adapt and expand. There is an increasing tendency to greater selectivity as to parts of the animal used for food and therefore, there is a trend from multi-purpose to single-purpose animals, with the production of animal protein the overriding objective. The aim of this paper is the examination of livestock products effects on environmental quality as agricultural trade liberalization happens in the six countries of Gulf Persian region, over 1980-2012. Our results show that this is an N-shaped EKC between income and the agricultural land expansion in this region. We find that livestock production decreases the percentage annual growth of agricultural land area use in this region as trade in agriculture sector is libered and the form of EKC has not changed when we enter livestock production index of the different countries, as agriculture trade is libered, in our model.

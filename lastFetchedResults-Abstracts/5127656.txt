This paper presents an extensible distributed platform that aims to speed up the development of personalized telemedicine systems, dealing with a series of recurrent problems in this kind of system, particularly: (1) functionality encapsulation and reuse in a set of services; (2) communications between the patientÂ´s home and the hospital, through a flexible scheme for bidirectional message exchange; and (3) the interaction between patients and the system. Home supervision is carried out through last generation smartphones. To date, the platform has been used for the follow-up of patients with COPD and cardiovascular diseases.

The conventional integration technologies have limitations for supporting good quality, high reliability, low LCC, low price and short lead time simultaneously in various stages of mechanical product development process. This has led to issues such as different design methods incompatibility, one-way and static integration. This paper proposes an integrated platform developed based on the design for life cycle six sigma to overcome these issues. The goal of the research is to provide an open and extensible infrastructure for dynamical and bidirectional mechanical product design methodology. A multi-layer design architecture for the integrated platform is proposed. One of the key issues about quality and reliability integrated modeling is discussed, which is solved by a proposed six sigma workflow modeling method.

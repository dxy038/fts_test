The Brazilian electric systems need the development of new researches and tools, in order to obtain a logic solution to maintain and improve the reliability and the quality of the power delivered to customers. The study of the appropriate connection of dispersed generation sources is an essential topic to be analyzed, since this process may provide positive impacts along the feeders. The main effects of the DG operation inside a distribution system model are here analyzed through the software DigSilent<sup>&#174;</sup>, considering power losses and voltage levels. Moreover, a multi-objective methodology - Bellman-Zadeh algorithm and membership fuzzy functions - is used for evaluating quantitative and qualitative parameters. The main objective of the paper is finding the appropriate DG placement inside a distribution system model. It is important to observe that the methodology presented in this study can be applied to distribution system feeders to find in which feeder will be the most appropriate DG location, as well to any node inside a determined feeder providing a specific place for the appropriate DG site.

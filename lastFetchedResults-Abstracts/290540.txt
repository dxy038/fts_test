With an ageing population, increasing numbers of women are presenting with pelvic floor disorders. The lifetime risk of undergoing prolapse or incontinence surgery in the USA is 1 in 11. With a recognized reoperation rate exceeding 30% for prolapse surgery, attempts are being made to improve our primary surgical outcomes. The introduction of synthetic and biological prostheses have been proposed to reduce recurrence rates whilst maintaining vaginal capacity and coital function. The role of synthetic prostheses is well established for use in continence surgery in the form of midurethral slings and for abdominal sacrocolpopexy to correct vault prolapse. However, postoperative morbidity—specifically the risk of mesh erosion—has limited their use for vaginal prolapse surgery. Biological prostheses have been introduced to offer an alternative for use in these repairs. While these grafts largely obviate the problem of erosion there are concerns regarding longevity, and only short-term outcome data are currently available. The role of prosthetics in pelvic floor surgery is an evolving and controversial field. Current and future research should be directed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of specific products and comparison of subjective and objective outcome parameters to standard surgical techniques for pelvic organ prolapse.

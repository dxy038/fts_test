We study the optimal survivability design problem under a scheduled traffic model in wavelength convertible WDM optical mesh networks. In this model, a set of demands is given, and the setup time and teardown time of a demand are known in advance. We formulate the joint routing and wavelength assignment problems into integer linear programs that maximally exploit network resource reuse in both space and time. To solve large problems, the joint RWA problems are divided to a routing subproblem and wavelength assignment subproblems which are then solved individually. The overall objective is to minimize the total number of wavelength-links used by working paths and protection paths of all traffic demands while 100% restorability is guaranteed against any single failures. Our simulation results indicate that the optimization of resource sharing in space and time enabled by our connection-holding-time-aware protection schemes can achieve significantly better resource utilization than schemes that are holding time unaware.

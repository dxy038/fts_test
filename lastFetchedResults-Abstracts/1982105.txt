The objective of this study was to analyse antioxidant activity (AA) in fruits and vegetables from Uganda and to investigate whether AA in traditional food is sufficiently high to prevent oxidative stress and thus combat disease. We used the FRAP (ferric reducing ability of plasma) procedure. The results showed great variation in AA, ranging from 72.3 ± 13.5 (Syzygium cuminii seed) to 0.09 ± 0.05 (Cucurbita maxima fruit) mmol/100 g fresh weight (FW). We estimated serving sizes and determined the total antioxidant capacity (TDAC) per day of three traditional Ugandan diets. The dietary plants with highest AA per serving size were pomegranate (Punica granatum), Canarium schweinfurthii, guava (Psidium guajava), mango (Mangifera indica) and tree tomato (Cyphomandra betacea) with values ranging from 8.91 to 3.00 mmol/serving. Of the traditional diets, the central/eastern (C/E) and the western (W) diets had almost the same AA (9.31–9.78 and 9.75 mmol/day), while the northern (N) diet had an AA of 7.50–8.02 mmol/day.

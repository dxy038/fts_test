Fuzzy supervisory predictive control based on genetic algorithm optimization is proposed. For the nonlinear model, through a general objective function dynamically optimized to determine the optimal set-point for a given regulatory level, by using genetic algorithm in order to solve the nonlinear optimization problem for the setpoint, and compared with the supervisory predictive control based on linear model and nonlinear model. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm has better control performance.

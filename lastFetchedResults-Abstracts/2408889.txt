 
Background: The breeding performance is an important parameter to evaluate the breeding success in captive condition. The optimum hormone dose in combination with latency period is desirable for getting best breeding performance in fish.
Objectives: The objective of the study was to find the spawning latency period in the hormonal induced reproduction of Snow trout with two inducers (Ovaprim and hCG) separately and in combination. 
Materials and Methods: The fish spawners were separated to five groups randomly and treated with Ovaprim, Ovaprim with hCG (high dose), Ovaprim with hCG (low dose), hCG and saline water as control group.
Results: Results suggested that Ovaprim and high dose of hCG treatment lead to shorter latency time (40 h 40’), but ovulation percent, percentage of live embryos in the eyed stage and ovulation synchronization were lower than groups treated with Ovaprim singly or Ovaprim plus low dose of hCG. Females from the control and hCG groups did not spawn.
Conclusions: The highest hormonal stimulation effectiveness was recorded in the group where one hormonal substance (Ovaprim) was applied. The ovulation time was therefore difficult to predict accurately in Snow trout, Schizothorax zarudnyi.

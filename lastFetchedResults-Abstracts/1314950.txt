  The vehicle routing problem is the fundamental problem in distribution management, and in general it includes a set of problems in which a number of vehicles located  in one or many depots should meet and service to a set of customers, each requiring a certain amount of demands.On the other, in most real world problems especially in logistics area we face multi-objective problems. When looking for objectives, often objectives counteract and this is why considering multi-objective problem can be efficient. In real-world problems is increased demand for some goods at special occasions. On the other, one of the most important factors for customers is providing the request timely. In this study, customers have multiple demands; therefore a new mixed integer linear programming model for vehicle routing is presented by combining concepts of time windows and multiple demands and with two objectives: minimizing total cost and maximizing demand coverage. Two approaches based on NSGA-II algorithm with diversification of the mutation operator is designed for model solving. In applying this algorithm is used two-row structure of the chromosomes. Also, the algorithmsâ€™ results have been compared with two criteria, one based on covered non-dominated solutions and one based on spread solutions. Some of the generated benchmark instances are used to show the computational performance of the algorithms and the validity of the proposed model.

In order to evaluate the performance of complex product, a fuzzy method based on fuzzy matter-element and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is proposed. According to the quality objective and performance indicators, the system index of performance evaluation model is designed. Through FAHP and the model of fuzzy comprehensive estimation, the weights of evaluation index are determined for each performance criteria. Then, the performance of complex mechanical and electrical product can be identified by using the fuzzy matter-element theory and FAHP. Finally, A case study is presented to prove the methodÂ´s feasibility and validity.

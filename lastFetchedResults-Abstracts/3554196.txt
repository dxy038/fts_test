The addition of color to television has opened a new field of application for the science of color measurement. This paper discusses the need for objective colorimetric measurements in color television, and describes a photoelectric tristimulus colorimeter that has been developed for use in this field. This is an instrument for the objective measurement of chromaticity throughout the color gamut that is sufficiently accurate for general work in color television. The synthesis of the spectral characteristics of the instrument is discussed in detail.

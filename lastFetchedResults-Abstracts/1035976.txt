This contribution to materials selection theory aims at developing methodological methods and tools to analyse a complex set of material requirements with the objective of forecast whether there are materials that can fulfil it, or alternatively, if multi-materials selection is more likely to provide a solution. This “pre-analysis” of requirements examines the two main reasons which may prevent a single material solution: nonuniformity of materials space filling, or intrinsic contradiction between properties.

A variety of statistical tools is used, based on Multivariate Analysis Methods as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the estimation of density distribution in the materials space. These tools allow to evaluate the “statistical compatibility” between the requirements and the available materials, and provides an estimate of the likelihood to find a single material solution or not. The methodology is applied to the research of a material for a machine tool frame.

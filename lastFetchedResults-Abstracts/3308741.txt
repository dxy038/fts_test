Cyber-physical system (CPS) has been widely used in various areas as the integration of computing and physical system. As a typical application of CPS, cyber-physical surveillance system (CPSS) allows real-time video monitoring for various fields such as smart transportation and warehouse management systems. For video streaming in CPSS, dynamic radio spectrum management is a key technology dealing with the current situation that the spectrum resource is almost used up. In this paper, taking into account the application layer quality-of-service (QoS) and wireless link security, a novel dynamic spectrum management scheme is proposed to minimize the system cost of CPSS. Video distortion is considered as the application layer QoS metric, and the system cost is defined as a combination of distortion and security cost. We use intra-refreshing rate in video coding to minimize the distortion. Furthermore, the problem is formulated as a restless bandit system, which uses current and historical information to optimize the action, with the objective of maximizing the total discounted system reward. We also describe the spectrum management operation processes. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed scheme compared with the existing one that ignores video distortion and subband security optimization.

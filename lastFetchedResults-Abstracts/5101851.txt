OFDM has emerged as a potential option for the delivery of broadband wireless. Since its development for military applications in the 1960s, technical implementations of OFDM have appeared in digital audio broadcasting, digital subscriber lines, high definition television terrestrial broadcasting, and other systems. The paper presents an estimation of the uplink capacity for OFDM using test wireless cellular environment simulations. Spread-spectrum signals are employed. The objective is to obtain the uplink performance for data oriented services using this intriguing new delivery system.

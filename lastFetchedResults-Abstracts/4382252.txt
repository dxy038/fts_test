This paper presents a co-optimization planning model that considers the long-term interdependency of natural gas and electricity infrastructures. The model incorporates the natural gas transportation planning objective in the co-optimization planning of power generation and transmission systems. The co-optimization planning model is decomposed into a least-cost master investment problem for natural gas and electricity systems which interacts with two operation subproblems representing the feasibility (security) and the optimality (economic) of the proposed co-optimization. In addition, the natural gas subproblem would check the feasibility of fuel supply transportation system as part of the proposed co-optimization planning. The co-optimization planning of electricity and natural gas infrastructures would satisfy the desired power system reliability criterion. The iterative process will continue between the co-optimization investment and the operation subproblems until an economic, secure, reliable, and fuel-supply feasible planning for the two interdependent infrastructures is obtained. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization planning approach.

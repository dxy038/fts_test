The objective of this contribution is to describe thermal degradation of Miscanthus giganteus by a detailed reaction mechanism. It includes degradation kinetics for cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin which constitute the major mass fractions of M. giganteus. Furthermore, the mechanism yields a detailed composition of product gases, and is therefore well-suited to predict evolution of both thermal decomposition and products. Therefore, the reaction mechanism was introduced to the Discrete Particle Method (DPM) that solves the coupled differential conservation equations for mass, momentum, species, and energy for a M. giganteus particle. Predicted results were compared to experimental data and yielded good agreement.

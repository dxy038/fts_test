In the problem of multiple criteria decision making, there are situations in which information is incomplete or imprecise or views that are subjective or endowed with linguistic characteristics creating a "fuzzy" decision making environment, some index can\Â´t be expressed by certain number, just only expressed by linguistic words, under this situation, we must use fuzzy decision making method. In this paper, after analyzing the problem of multiple criteria decision making and the current methods, we bring forward a method of constituting weight assignment model by using fuzzy wavelet neural network to improve the method of multiple criteria decision making, therefore making the weight more objective and accurate. Then according to the weight we obtained, we use the fuzzy VIKOR algorithm to make decision. At last the numerical illustrations prove the new model to be effective and scientific.

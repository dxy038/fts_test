Context and objective: One of subjects raised in all organizations is
selecting the excellent option considering the respective indices. It is
applied in the different departments of police force. In case of using the
suitable decision-making styles, it will have effective role in achieving the
goals of this organization. On the other side, considering the respective
decision-making subject, usually various provisions with different priorities
are propounded. Therefore, we encounter some styles referred to as
multi-attribute decision-making. This study intends to seek for presenting
and expressing a multi-attribute decision-making style in order to select
the excellent police districts by the qualitative data and mathematical
approach.

Procedure: In this research, due to the study on academic method for
selecting the excellent police district, the suitable methodology is process
that explains the different stages of finding the problem solutions. In this
paper, a new algorithm is introduced and used for multi-attribute decisionmaking
in the fuzzy environment which has similarities and differences
to the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process in order to choose the excellent
police district as one of departments attracted by the police force. The
qualitative data for decision-making are simulated by trapezoidal fuzzy
number.
Findings and conclusion: The introduced process is capable to simulate
and evaluate by means of qualitative data, thus in the extensive decisionmaking
problems, it may be implemented. Whereas the calculations
related to the case study has been performed aiding excel, the major part
of decision-making process will be performed automatically.

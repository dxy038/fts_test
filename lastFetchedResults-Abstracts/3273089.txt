Wireless technologies employing small sensors are particularly useful since they allow monitoring of kinetic and physiological data without affecting any individual in motion. The primary objective of this collaborative research between the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computing Sciences and the Department of Athletes at the University of Cincinnati is to build a wireless system using a wireless body area sensor network (WBASN) for the overhead squat in assessing one element of human movement and its relationship to the kinematic lower extremity movement and injuries. This research can provide an objective analysis of the pilot data for movement of the human body during regular athletic exercises.

A 1.8V 2Mb spin-transfer torque RAM chip using a 0.2mum logic process with an MgO tunneling barrier cell demonstrates the circuit technologies for potential low-power non-volatile RAM, or universal memory. This chip features an array scheme with bit-by-bit bidirectional current write to achieve proper spin-transfer torque writing in 100ns, and parallelizing-direction current reading with a low-voltage bit-line that leads to 40ns access time.

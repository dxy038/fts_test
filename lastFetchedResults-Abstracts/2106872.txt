The objective of this study was to identify the specific localization of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in cells in situ in a variety of inflammatory processes in different tissues from pigs. Our hypothesis was that IL-8 primarily is a neutrophil related cytokine present in all extravascular neutrophils while expression also occurs in other cell types in response to an inflammatory stimulus. Using IL-8 immunohistochemistry we discovered that neutrophils were the predominant IL-8 positive cell population while epithelial cell types and endothelium of postcapillary venules could be positive when situated in close vicinity of an inflammatory lesion. Furthermore, endothelial cells of newly formed vessels in granulation tissue were positive in some specimens. Some sub-populations of inflammatory neutrophils were, however, IL-8 negative which could reflect some phase of neutrophil swarming.

To quantify the effect of gravel content on the liquefaction resistance of sand-gravel composites, a series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests was performed on sand-gravel composite specimens with gravel contents of 0%, 10%, 25%. The confining pressure in all test series was 100 KPa. The main objective of this research project was to compare the behavior of sand gravel composites during seismic liquefaction conditions for various gravel contents, preparing by two different methods. Two methods of sample preparation that were used for each soil type included moist tamping and dry funnel deposition. The results indicate that the liquefaction resistances of specimens prepared with dry funnel deposition method is more than specimens reconstituted by moist tamping method. Furthermore, the liquefaction resistance of sand-gravel composites may increase significantly with increasing gravel content.

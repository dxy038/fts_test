The history of ethics based on virtue goes back to the time of Plato and Aristotle. Currently, Filipaphot, like Aneskomp, McIntire and Mordake, tried to revive the philosophy of virtue-based ethics. Phot seeks to prove that virtue and ethics based on virtue have a real basis; a notion which represents a challenge to the theories about realism in temporary philosophy of ethics. He considers good as a part of reality and emphasizes on the conventional meaning of good. He thinks that good is a specific quality or one of the special functions of a living creature. The main concern of this research is to see how far he has been successful in accomplishing this objective and removing non-realistic challenge.  This paper seeks through a descriptive-analytic method to investigate Filipaphot's ethic of virtue and reviews his theory about natural normalization. This paper concludes that although Filipaphot and his followers have succeeded to attract peopleâ€™s attention to the virtue-based approach, should be able to responsible he some of the criticisms directed to him in this concern.

A generalized subspace approach is proposed for enhancement of speech corrupted by colored noise. A nonunitary transform, based on the simultaneous diagonalization of the clean speech and noise covariance matrices, is used to project the noisy signal onto a signal-plus-noise subspace and a noise subspace. The clean signal is estimated by ing the signal components in the noise subspace and retaining the components in the signal subspace. The applied transform has built-in prewhitening and can therefore be used in general for colored noise. The proposed approach is shown to be a generalization of the approach proposed by Y. Ephraim and H.L. Van Trees (see ibid., vol.3, p.251-66, 1995) for white noise. Two estimators are derived based on the nonunitary transform, one based on time-domain constraints and one based on spectral domain constraints. Objective and subjective measures demonstrate improvements over other subspace-based methods when tested with TIMIT sentences corrupted with speech-shaped noise and multi-talker babble.

Objective: One of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) named as ketorolac
is frequently used to relieve acute pain. Current study was conducted with the aim
of ketorolac efficacy measurement as a pain killer agent for controlling the primary
headache in emergency departments.
Methods: In this study, we enrolled 50 patients with primary headache who received
60 mg ketorolac intravenously as a slow infusion in about 10 minutes. Pain scores
were evaluated with visual analog scale (VAS) on arrival and also 1 hour and 2 hours
after ketorolac infusion. Statistical analysis was performed on collected data by using
Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests to assess the differences in VAS pain scores.
Results: Decreasing the VAS more than 3 points from the arrival until 1 hour (P  <  0.001),
and more than 5 points from the arrival until 2 hours after ketorolac administration
(P  <  0.001) were seen. Those with history of analgesic use before admission in
emergency department in comparison with the others did not accompany with more
decline in pain score after 1 hour (P = 0.34) or 2 hours (P = 0.92).
Conclusion: It seems that ketorolac is assured, safe and well tolerated agent for pain
control in patients presented with primary headache to the emergency departments.
Based on the results achieved in this study, ketorolac illustrates its perceptible effects
within 1 hour after administration that even more prominent after 2 hours.

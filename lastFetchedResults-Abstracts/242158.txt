Appropriate energy–environment–economic (E3) modelling provides key information for policy makers in the electricity supply
industry (ESI) faced with navigating a sustainable development path. Key challenges include engaging with stakeholder values and
preferences, and exploring trade-offs between competing objectives in the face of underlying uncertainty. As a case study we represent the
South African ESI using a partial equilibrium E3 modelling approach, and extend the approach to include multiple objectives under
selected future uncertainties. This extension is achieved by assigning cost penalties to non-cost attributes to force the model’s least-cost
objective function to better satisfy non-cost criteria. This paper incorporates aspects of flexibility to demand growth uncertainty into each
future expansion alternative by introducing stochastic programming with recourse into the model. Technology lead times are taken into
account by the inclusion of a decision node along the time horizon where aspects of real options theory are considered within the
planning process. Hedging in the recourse programming is automatically translated from being purely financial, to include the other
attributes that the cost penalties represent. From a retrospective analysis of the cost penalties, the correct market signals, can be derived
to meet policy goal, with due regard to demand uncertainty.

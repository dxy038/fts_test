Background and Objective: One of the most common and important problems in neonates is low birth weight (LBW). The prevalence of LBW in Iran is estimated 12%, 30-50% of whom are preterm. Improvement in care procedures of these neonates in addition to decrease the cost of care can cause reduction in complications of neonatal, childhood and adulthood period. With regarding to the importance of growth and development, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of massage with coconut oil on weight gain of preterm neonates.

Subjects and Methods: This study is a clinical trial which was carried out on 72 healthy preterm neonates with gestational age between 34-37 weeks who had the conditions of entrance to the study. The sampling was done randomly based on purpose of the study. Neonates were divided into three equal groups (24 in each): control, massage and massage with oil. In massage group: massaging were done 3 times-a-day and each session lasted for 5 minutes based on the teacher techniques started from the days 3 to 17 after birth by the mother. In the oil-massage group the same techniques were done with 10 ml/kg coconut oil for the same period. In control group there were no interventions. Weights were measured, 7th and 14th days after birth. Results: The average gestational age at birth was 35-37 weeks. The average weight was 2314 g and there was no significant difference between these groups. There was a significant difference in average weight gain 7 days after intervention in massage with oil(2525.42 gr) to control group (2267.29 gr) (P=0.04) and in massage (2444.38 gr) to control group (P=0.02). On day 14 after intervention there was a significant difference in massage with oil (2789.58 gr) to control group (2375.42 gr) (P< 0.001) and in massage (2606.67 gr) to control group (P< 0.01) and also there was a significant difference between massage with oil to massage group (P=0.04). Conclusion: This study showed that massage and especially massage with oil is an effective and valuable method in weight gain in preterm neonates.

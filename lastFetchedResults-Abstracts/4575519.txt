Congestion in the transmission lines is one of the technical problems that appears particularly in the deregulated environment. There are two types of congestion management methodologies to relieve it. One is non-cost free methods and another is cost-free methods, among them later method relieves the congestion technically whereas the former is related with the economics. In this paper congestion is relieved using cost free methods. Using FACTS devices, congestion can be reduced without disturbing the economic matters. TCSC and UPFC are two mainly emerging FACTS devices and they are used in this paper to reduce the congestion. In congestion management, the objective function is nonlinear hence in solving this function genetic algorithm (GA) technique is used to obtain the global optimal solution. Above method is tested on IEEE 30-bus system and it can be extended to any practical system

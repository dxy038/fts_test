In this paper, we propose an intelligent communication scheme for power protection system. The objective is to improve the reliability of power protection system and make sure protective devices accurately trigger protection schemes when system faults occur. We implement the prototype of the proposed scheme and conduct experiments on a set of typical system faults. The experimental results show that our technique can effectively and accurately deal with power system faults.

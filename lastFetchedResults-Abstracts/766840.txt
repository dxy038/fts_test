Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a precision
technique useful for obtaining high quality ceramic bodies
with controlled dimensions and smooth coatings. The
electrophoretic deposition rate is highly dependent on the
surface chemistry of the powders, especially when dealing
with multi-component systems. The objective of this work
is to study the surface reactivity of both ZrO2 and MgO in
ethanol suspension to provide experimental benchmarks to
control EPD of a ZrO2–3 wt% MgO mechanical mixture
(Z3M) in ethanol. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed
that ZrO2 surface spontaneously reacts with ethanol, generating
negative electrophoretic mobility of the particles (–
0.07 · 10–8 V–1 s–1) measured by Electroacoustic Sonic
Amplitude (ESA). MgO surface also spontaneously reacted
with ethanol, but a positive electrophoretic mobility was
observed in this case (0.26 · 10–8 V–1 s–1). Scanning
Electron Microscopy of Z3M dried from ethanol suspension
showed that MgO particles were located around the
ZrO2 particles, forming composite agglomerates, probably
due to the electrostatic attraction between MgO and ZrO2
particles. Homogeneous deposits could be obtained from
EPD of Z3M ethanol suspensions. Mercury intrusion porosimetry
showed that the ZrO2–MgO green deposited
bodies using different voltages had similar pores diameters
distributions, indicating that the ZrO2–MgO agglomerates
are not affected by the increasing deposition rates.

This paper describes a decision support system for dewatering systems selection (DSSDSS) developed using Visual Basic 6.0 for use on a Windows-compatible computer. DSSDSS helps the project planner, estimator or quantity surveyor in a contractor's firm or the design engineer in a consultancy service to select the most appropriate dewatering system for a project. It uses the multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) to apply objective measurement to the seven main parameters identified when selecting a dewatering system. The parameters were: the soil/ground type, excavation size, excavation depth, proposed methods of excavation and ground support, proximity of the nearest structure, depth of water below ground level, and permeability of the ground. The knowledge of DSSDSS is obtained from the literature, including codes of practice, and various human experts. The system was tested on an actual project in Singapore. The results compared favourably with the Project Manager's own selection of a dewatering system. Finally, the paper examines the features that make DSSDSS a useful tool, and also considers its limitations.

The paper presents &#937;(<e1>m</e1> log <e1>n</e1>) and &#937;( <e1>mn</e1>) message lower bounds on the problem of computing a global sensitive function in bidirectional networks with link failures (i.e., dynamically changing topology), where <e1>n</e1> and <e1>m</e1> are the total number of nodes and links in the network. Then &#937;(<e1>m</e1> log <e1>n</e1>) lower bound is under the assumption that <e1>n</e1> is a-priori known to the nodes, while the second bound is for the case in which such knowledge is not available . A global sensitive function of <e1>n</e1> variables is a function that may not be computed without the knowledge of the values of all the <e1>n</e1> variables (e.g. maximum, sum, etc.). Thus, computing such a function at one node of a distributed network requires this node to communicate with every other node in the network. Though lower bounds higher than &#937;(<e1>m</e1>) messages are known for this problem in the context of link failures, none holds for dense bidirectional networks. Moreover, the authors are not aware of any other non-trivial lower bound higher than &#937;(<e1>m</e1>) for dense bidirectional networks

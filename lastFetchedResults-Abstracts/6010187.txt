This paper presents a case study about the optimal allocation of renewable-based DG resources in rural areas using genetic algorithms. After building the power flow model based on the available data, the system performance in terms of power losses are studied for different scenarios. Based on loss minimization as an objective function, the optimal location and size of DG is found. In addition, the fuel saving, loss reduction and environmental benefits of the proposed DG size at the optimum location are quantified.

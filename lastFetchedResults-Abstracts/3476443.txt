A novel approach based on the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) technique is proposed for the transient-stability constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF) problem. Optimal power flow (OPF) with transient-stability constraints considered is formulated as an extended OPF with additional rotor angle inequality constraints. For this nonlinear optimisation problem, the objective function is defined as minimising the total fuel cost of the system. The proposed PSO-based approach is demonstrated and compared with conventional OPF as well as a genetic algorithm based counterpart on the IEEE 30-bus system. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the PSO-based TSCOPF in handling multiple contingencies is illustrated using the New England 39-bus system. Test results show that the proposed approach is capable of obtaining higher quality solutions efficiently in the TSCOPF problem

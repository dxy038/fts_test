A new non-isolated bidirectional converter is proposed on this work. This converter stage is suitable for applications of DC and AC motor drives. In this converter, for a given duty cycle, the output to input voltage ratio can be raised by adding transformer turns ratio. Another important feature of this converter is the lower blocking voltage across the controlled switches compared to similar circuits, which allows the utilization of MOSFETs switches with lower conduction resistances R<sub>DS(on)</sub>. In order to verify the feasibility of this topology; principle of operation, theoretical analysis, and experimental waveforms are shown for a 500 W assembled prototype.

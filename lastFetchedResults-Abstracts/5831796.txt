This work proposes a scheme to promote autonomous and selfish NDN (Named Data Networking) peering domains to cooperate in caching, here dubbed Not So Cooperative Caching (NSCC). We consider a network comprised of selfish nodes; each is with a caching capability and an objective of reducing its own access cost by fetching data from local cache or from neighboring caches. The challenge is to determine what objects to cache at each node so as to induce low individual node access costs, and the realistic access &#8220;price&#8221; model which allows various access &#8220;prices&#8221; of different node pairs further complicates the decision making. NSCC attempts to identify mistreatment-free object placement to incur implicit cooperation even among these selfishly behaving domains, and to further identify Nash equilibrium object placement from mistreatment-free object placements so that no domain can unilaterally change its placement and benefit while the others keep theirs unchanged, and to improve the cooperation performance with respect to fairness So far, using a game-theoretic approach NSCC seeks a global object placement in which the individual node access costs are reduced as compared to that when they operate in isolation and achieves Nash equilibrium. Our preliminary experiments with IBR verified its effectiveness. And we discuss the specific issues of NSCCÂ´s implementation in NDN.

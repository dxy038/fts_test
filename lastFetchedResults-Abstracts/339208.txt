Objective
Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is considered as an attractive alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic stem cell transplantations in patients who lack human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors. However, the low cell dose adversely affects hematopoietic recovery and therefore limits application of UCB transplantation in adults. Transplantation of multiple UCB units could be a strategy to overcome cell dose limitations.
Materials and Methods

To investigate the effect of double cord transplantation, nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice were transplanted with human hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+) derived from two UCB units with HLA disparity. Human cell engraftment and donor origin was determined by flow cytometry.
Results

Double CB transplantation resulted in increased engraftment levels in the bone marrow and peripheral blood in comparison with recipients of a single unit. Because this effect could be due to the higher cell dose (2.105 vs 1.105 cells), double CB transplantation was compared with single units containing equal cell numbers (2.105). In some cases, engraftment levels in recipients of single units containing 2.105 cells were significantly higher than after transplantation of 1.105 cells. These engraftment levels were similar to those observed after double CB transplantation. Chimerism analysis indicated that increased engraftment in recipients of two units was predominantly derived from one unit, whereas in other cases the contribution of the two units was similar.
Conclusion

These results indicate that engraftment may be enhanced by addition of a second unrelated CB that might be attributed to a cell dose effect or due to a graft-facilitating effect.

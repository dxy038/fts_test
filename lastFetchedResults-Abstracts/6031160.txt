During video transmission over error-prone networks, the compressed bit stream is often corrupted by channel errors which may cause the video quality degrading suddenly. In this paper, we present a novel temporal error concealment technique as a post-processing tool at the decoder side for recovering the lost information. In order to recover the lost motion vector, an improved decoder motion vector estimation (DMVE) criterion is introduced which considers temporal correlation and motion trajectory together. We utilize pixels in the two previous frames as well as surrounding pixels of the lost block. The best motion vector is determined according to the criterion, and then the lost pixels are recovered using motion compensation. Simulations show that the proposed technique can achieve remarkable objective (PSNR) and subjective gains in the quality of the recovered video.

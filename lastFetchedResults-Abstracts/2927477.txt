The objective of this paper is to implement a two-link with three-joint robot controller by an 8051 microcontroller system. In order to detect obstacles around the working space, two ultrasonic sensors are attached around the second link. The inverse kinematics of the robot are also derived by a geometry approach and integrated into the system program, so that users are allowed to enter the desired position in Cartesian space. Experimental results indicate that the robot works as expected. This device could be used as a tool for education or industrial applications. Features of this system include high reliability, simplicity, friendly user interface and low cost

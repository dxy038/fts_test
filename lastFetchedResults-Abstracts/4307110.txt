The objective of this paper it to present a work concerning a proposed design and development of an analog Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) with built-in analogue control loop and PWM for DC/DC power converters used in space applications. The described circuit can be used in avionics, aerospace devices and vehicles. The paper presents the general requirements that are needed for such component and shows its advantages over traditional. Finally, the paper discusses the way of the ASIC implementation, elaborated ASIC architecture and introductory works on its components. Means and ways of reaching space grade level are also presented.

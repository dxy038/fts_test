Due to the rapid increase of electricity demand, consideration of environmental constraints in optimal power flow (OPF) problems is increasingly important. In Algeria up to 90% of the electricity demand produced by thermal generators (vapor, gas), in order to keep the emission of gaseous pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and Nitrogen (NO<sub>2</sub>) under the admissible ecological limits, many conventional and global optimization methods proposed to study the trade-off relation between fuel cost and emissions. This paper presents an efficient decomposed Parallel GA to solve the multi objective environmental/economic dispatch problem. At the decomposed stage the length of the original chromosome is reduced successively and adapted to the topology of the new partition. Two sub problems are proposed: the first sub problem related to the active power planning to minimize the total fuel cost, and the second sub problem is a reactive power planning to make fine corrections to the voltage deviation and reactive power violation using a specified number of shunt dynamic compensators named Static Var Compensators (SVC). To validate the robustness of the proposed approach, the algorithm proposed tested on the Algerian 59-bus network test and compared with conventional method and with global optimization methods (GA, FGA, and ACO). The results show that the approach proposed can converge to the near solution and obtain a competitive solution at critical situation and with a reasonable time.

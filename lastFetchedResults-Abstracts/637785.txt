This article uses the The Lemon Tree by Sandy Tolan (2006) to demonstrate
how one type of book, a literary non-fiction book written for popular
audiences, can be used in a political science course such as one on
the Arab–Israeli conflict. The book concisely presents multiple Arab–
Israeli perspectives and enlivens the history and infuses it with both
broader and deeper meaning. After a brief summary of the plot, the
article gives examples of political science themes for which the book is
a useful text: nationalism and the formation of national identity; the
relationship between structure and agency; and the search for objective
truth. The book also suggests many broad Arab–Israeli motifs. The article
explains how the book was used in the classroom, including discussions,
guidance sheets, and a longer paper assignment.

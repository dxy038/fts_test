Background and Objective: Amniotic membrane (AM) as a natural tissue has lots of unique features which make it a suitable candidate for vascular tissue engineering. The aim of this study was to evaluate blood compatibility of mesenchymal surface of the AM.  
Materials and Methods: In this study, the effect of mesenchymal surface of the AM on internal and external coagulation pathways, hemolysis and platelet activity was measured and the results were compared with heparin-coated ePTFE as a synthetic vessel substitute. In addition, platelet adhesion and their morphologic changes after being in contact with samples were analyzed by electron microscopy. 
Results: Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), clotting time and hemolysis tests showed that the AM is hemocompatible. Additionally, mesenchymal surface of the AM induced platelet aggregation less than ePTFE while both similarly provoked secretion of P-selectin. Number of adhered platelets to mesenchymal surface of the AM was less than ePTFE. The platelets on the mesenchymal surface had round morphology whereas ePTFE exhibited dendritic shape platelets.  
Conclusion: Results of this study showed that the mesenchymal surface of the AM is hemocompatible which could be a proper candidate for vascular tissue engineering.

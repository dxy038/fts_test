Objective: This study focuses on the characteristics of frontal sharp transients (FST), a normal variant of neonatal EEG, in newborns with hypoglycemia.
Methods: The EEG from 20 newborns with symptomatic hypoglycemia were compared with a control group of normal newborns matched by conceptional age. The dynamics of these transients were evaluated concerning sleep stages. The density, type and bilateral synchrony of FST were also calculated. The results were compared in the two groups by Student's t test.
Results: When compared with controls, hypoglycemic newborns have increased density of frontal sharp transients in all sleep stages but less bilateral synchrony (P<0.05). FST density was even higher in small for gestational age newborns.
Conclusions: The data suggests that normal patterns of neonatal EEG as FST can be influenced by systemic disturbances.

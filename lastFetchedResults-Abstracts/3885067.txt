Both exponential stability and periodic oscillatory solution of bidirectional associative memory (BAM) networks with axonal signal transmission delays are considered by constructing suitable Lyapunov functional and some analysis techniques. Some simple sufficient conditions are given ensuring the global exponential stability and the existence of periodic oscillatory solutions of BAM with delays. These conditions are presented in terms of system parameters and have important leading significance in the design and applications of globally exponentially stable and periodic oscillatory neural circuits for BAM with delays. In addition, two examples are given to illustrate the results

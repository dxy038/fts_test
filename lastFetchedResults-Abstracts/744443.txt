Myocardial bridging is the most common congenital coronary abnormality, and is frequently found on post-mortem cardiac examination. Although often asymptomatic, clinical presentation can vary from unstable angina to sudden cardiac death. Only isolated cases of using drug eluting stents (DES) for bridging segments have been described. Our objective was to retrospectively analyze a series of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with DES for symptomatic myocardial bridging and follow post-procedure outcomes. Results revealed favorable peri-procedural angiographic and short-term clinical results with DES implantation. Although initial data regarding DES implantation for symptomatic myocardial bridging are promising, long-term follow up, particularly related to in-stent restenosis will be important.

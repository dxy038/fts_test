A comparison between an objective quality measure and the perceived mean annoyance values of watermarked videos is presented. A psychophysical experiment has been performed to measure the detection threshold and mean annoyance values of several watermarked videos, using two different marks. The results of this experiment were then compared with an objective quality measure, obtained through a tracing watermarking system. An estimation of the detection threshold of the watermarked videos was found.

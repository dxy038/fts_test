In this letter, we propose a novel frequency-domain approach to double-talk detection (DTD) based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). In contrast to a previous approach based on a simple and heuristic decision rule utilizing time-domain cross-correlations, GMM is applied to a set of feature vectors extracted from the frequency-domain cross-correlation coefficients. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through objective tests under various environments, and better results are obtained as compared to the time-domain method.

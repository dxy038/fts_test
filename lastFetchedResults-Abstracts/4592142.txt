In order to deal with the shortcoming of conventional optimal multiuser detection methods,this paper reports a novel multiuser detection algorithm based on improved immune-genetic algorithm which regards objective function as antigen, solution as antibody and updates the population using evolutionary strategy. The selection strategy is fused to the conventional genetic algorithm to improve the performance of genetic algorithm. The selection strategy is consists of three computational procedures: evaluating the diversity of genes, calculating the percentage of genes, and computing the selection probability of genes. The computer simulation results show that the method has more powerful properties than the detector based on classical algorithm and has powerful properties in bit error rate.

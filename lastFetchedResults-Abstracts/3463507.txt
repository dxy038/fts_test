A bidirectional movable boundary control strategy with limited wideband storage access is proposed and analysed. This new strategy is offered as an alternative to a recently analysed, combined pre-emptive priority and bit rate compression strategy for multiplexing a blockable, incompressible wideband with a queueable narrowband traffic type onto a common broadband transmission resource.

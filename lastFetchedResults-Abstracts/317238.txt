The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of a new modification of the blink reflex test with stimulation of the distribution of the mental nerve in iatrogenic lesions of the inferior alveolar nerve. The test was performed on 23 patients undergoing orthognathic surgery of the mandible, most of them (20) with bilateral sagittal split osteotomies. The function of the inferior alveolar nerve was studied preoperatively, and 2 weeks, 2 months, 6 months and 1 year postoperatively with both mental nerve blink reflex test and clinical neurosensory testing. The objective electrophysiological test proved to be useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of sensory impairment of the inferior alveolar nerve. The results of the mental nerve blink reflex test and clinical neurosensory testing were closely related. The results of the two tests did not differ statistically significantly in the two first postoperative examinations. The positive predictive value of the mental nerve blink reflex test was better than that of clinical neurosensory testing: an initially abnormal reflex response predicted persistent subjective sensory symptoms after one year more reliably than did altered sensation at the first two examinations. Irrespective of the possible coexistent sensory symptoms and signs, a normal mental nerve blink reflex within 2 months after operation also predicted a reasonably good sensory recovery at 1 year.

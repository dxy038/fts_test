Burning rate is a determining parameter in performance prediction of Solid Propellant motors. Any error in determining the burning rate directly affects the prediction of thrust and burning time. Small-scale rocket motors are widely used by space and military industries to carry out burning rate measurement. The use of small-scale motors has many advantages over other simple equipments, such as strand burners. Effects such as: two phase flow, radiation, and erosive burning effects could be present within small-scale test motors whereas strand burners are not capable of capturing these parameters. The biggest problem with small-scale motors, however, is determining appropriate times for when the propellant grain has been lit and burned out. Accurate and consistent selection of start and end points is crucial to determining the burning rate of a given propellant. Experimental measurement of burning rate using developed and modern methods according to the primary methods in Iran's aerospace industries is the main objective of this study. In this study, 26 tests have been carried out using designed laboratory solid rocket motor. Reproducibility of the methods available in universities and defense companies worldwide has been considered and compared with Common Tangent bisection method. Results show the high quality of industrial methods subset the thickness-time method, Hessler-Glick method, and mass balance method compared to low reproducibility of tangent bisection method.

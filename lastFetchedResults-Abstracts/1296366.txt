Background and Objectives: Considering the high prevalence of diabetes and the important role of insulin resistance and inflammation in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis and its resulted cardiovascular diseases, the present study was conducted with the objective of investigating the effect of oligofructose-enriched inulin on the levels of glycemic indices and inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods: In this clinical trial, 52 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to two groups. The subjects of experimental group (n=27) received 10g oligofructose-enriched inulin and the control group (n=25) 10g maltodextrin for 8 weeks. Dietary intakes, anthropometric measurements, glycemic indices and inflammation were measured at the baseline and at the end of the study. Statistical analysis was done using paired and independent t-tests, and analysis of covariance for comparison of quantitative variables.

Results: In this study, a significant decrease was observed in fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, IL-6 and TNF-? in oligofructose-enriched inulin group compared to the maltodextrin group. Decreases in HOMA-IR, QUICKI, hs-CRP were not significant in oligofructose-enriched inulin compared to maltodextrin group. 

Conclusion: The results revealed that oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation can improve glycemic indices and inflammation in women with type 2 diabetes.

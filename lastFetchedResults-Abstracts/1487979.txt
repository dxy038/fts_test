The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms on meat and sensory quality in Berkshire pigs. A total of 85 pigs were evaluated, and muscle samples were taken for the analyses of MHC isoform, meat quality, fatty acid composition, and sensory evaluation. Content of the MHC slow isoform was significantly correlated with pH24 h (r = 0.26, P &lt; 0.05) and drip loss (r = − 0.32, P &lt; 0.01), although the content of MHC isoforms showed limited relationships with individual fatty acids. In the case of sensory evaluation of meat by a trained panel test, the MHC fast/slow ratio was correlated with the juiciness (r = − 0.33, P &lt; 0.01), off-flavor (r = 0.34, P &lt; 0.01), tenderness attributes (r = − 0.43 to − 0.47). These results imply that the content of MHC isoforms can influence various aspects of quality including pork and sensory quality in Berkshire pigs.

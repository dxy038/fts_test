A very large majority of farm animals express seasonal variations in their production traits, thus inducing seasonal availability of
fresh derived animal products (meat, milk, cheese and eggs). This pattern is in part the consequence of the farmerâ€™s objective to
market his products in the most economically favourable period. It may also be imposed by the season-dependent access to feed
resources, as in ruminants, or by the specific requirements derived from adaptation to environmental conditions such as water
temperature in fish. But seasonal variations in animal products are also the consequence of constraints resulting from the
occurrence of a more or less marked seasonal reproductive season in most farm animal species including fish, poultry and
mammals. Like their wild counterparts, at mid and high latitudes, most farm animals normally give birth at the end of winter-early
spring, the most favourable period for the progeny to survive and thus promote the next generation. As a consequence, most
species show seasonal variations in their ovulation frequency (mammals and fish: presence or absence of ovulation; birds:
variations or suppression of laying rates), spermatogenic activity (from moderate to complete absence of sperm production),
gamete quality (variations in fertilisation rates and embryo survival), and also sexual behaviour. Among species of interest for
animal production, fishes and birds are generally considered as more directly sensitive to external factors (mainly temperature in
fish, photoperiod in birds). In all species, it is therefore advisable that artificial photoperiodic treatments consisting of extra-light
during natural short days (in chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, sheep and goats) or melatonin during long days (in goats, sheep) be
extensively used to either adjust the breeding season to animal producer needs and/or to completely overcome seasonal
variations of sperm production in artificial insemination centres (mammals) and breeder flock operations (poultry, fish farming).
Pure light treatments (without melatonin), especially when applied in open barns, could be considered as non invasive ones which
fully respect animal welfare.

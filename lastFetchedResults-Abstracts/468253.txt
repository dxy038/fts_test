Objective: The purposes of this study were to examine expression of nitric oxide synthase isoforms in human myometrium and to determine any changes in expression with gestational age and with the onset of labor at term. Study Design: Myometrial samples were collected from patients undergoing cesarean delivery at term before and after the onset of labor (n = 17) and throughout gestation (n = 13). Expressions of inducible, calcium-independent nitric oxide synthase and constitutive, calcium-dependent endothelial nitric oxide synthase were determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptaseâ€“polymerase chain reaction. Results:Messenger ribonucleic acid for inducible, calcium-independent nitric oxide synthase and constitutive, calcium-dependent endothelial nitric oxide synthase is expressed in human myometrium at term and throughout the second and third trimesters. Levels of messenger ribonucleic acid for both inducible, calcium-independent nitric oxide synthase and constitutive, calcium-dependent endothelial nitric oxide synthase do not change with either gestational age or the onset of labor. Conclusion: Changes in myometrial nitric oxide synthase expression and thus of levels of endogenous nitric oxide are unlikely to be directly involved in myometrial quiescence or the onset of human parturition.

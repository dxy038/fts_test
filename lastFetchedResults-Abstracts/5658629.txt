In order to solve a kind of quadratic integer programming problem with unrestrained conditions and multi-objective function, improvements on the traditional branch and bound algorithm are carried out in this paper. By introducing response function, a practical branch and bound algorithm to solve the quadratic integer programming model is derived. The procedure of the proposed algorithm is explicated in this paper and an example with two manufactures is studied. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective than the traditional branch and bound algorithm, and fit for more complex problems.

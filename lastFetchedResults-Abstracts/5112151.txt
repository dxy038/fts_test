The ionosphere is important because of its role in radio communication, and the electrons are easier to detect experimentally than the neutral air. The electron and ions form a weakly ionized gas or plasma, and plasma physics associated with detailed ionospheric structure is relevant to radio propagation. Other current research topics are prediction and forecasting of ionospheric condition on various time scales (space weather) and long term studies of global change. In this communication we have computed parcel velocity of the ionosphere situated at Pakistan atmospheric Region (PAR). Our objective is to model and forecast the parcel velocity of ionospheric plasma layers at (PAR) appropriately then the selected model has been used to forecast the parcel velocity of ionospheric plasma layers at (PAR) if the same conditions prevail. This kind of study is useful for predicting and forecasting the salient features of space science. Pakistan is situated in the West and North-West of South Asia. It lies from 23.45&#176; to 36.75&#176; in the northern latitudes, and from 61&#176; to 75.5&#176; eastern longitudes. Due to this critical geographical position and the large positive correlation between the plasma turbulence and yearly variation of time in the Ionospheric region of Pakistan has been found. As we know that the Earth is a rotating sphere, consider a point completing a circle of radius R in time t, its tangential speed &#957; = 2&#960;R/t. The angular velocity (&#937;) in radiations per second is 2&#960;/t since momentum corresponding to a velocity at height of the space h. V<sub>PARCEL</sub> = &#937;(R + h) cos&#934; Stochastic analysis has been utilized to explain the behavior of parcel velocity of Ionospheric plasma layers. This kind of approach is used to model parcel velocity of Ionospheric plasma layers at Pakistan air space, thus useful predictions could be obtained for public, private and other organizations engaged in space re- - search.

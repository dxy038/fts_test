Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (RPMS) is an innovative approach in treatment of central paresis, e.g. after stroke. The main goals of our current research are the improvement of the therapeutic effect by inducing closed loop controlled movements on the one hand, and the objective assessment of the RPMS therapy on the other hand. One important parameter that allows the evaluation of the therapy progress and that gives insight in neurological processes is the level of spasticity. Current methods to evaluate spasticity are not completely objective and error-prone. This paper presents a novel method of spasticity quantification. The used algorithms are based on parameter estimation methods and can be executed during the therapeutic stimulation. Hence, objective spasticity parameters can be obtained without applying any extra equipment. The presented method has been tested with one patient

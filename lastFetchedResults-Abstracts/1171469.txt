Utilization of non-food-grade organic solvents and high shear forces in conventional liposome formation techniques has limited their applications as carriers of nutrecuticals in food industry. The objective of this research is the production of gamma-oryzanol bearing nanoliposome by using modified thermal method. Nanoliposomes were produced by a suitable concentration of lecithin and gamma-oryzanol solution. Size and zetapotential of nanoliposomes was determined using laser light scattering method and Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed for detection of interaction type between the nanoliposome and gamma-oryzanol. Then, the prepared samples were tested in terms of turbidity, stability, and rheological properties. The FTIR results demonstrate that interactions between lecithin and gama-oryzanol are weak physical type. The results of particle size showed that size distribution (span) were in the range of 90-110 nm and 0.69- 0.90, respectively. The negative zeta potential and loading capacity were reported 20.4 mV and 15.7% (Â±0.07), respectively. The results indicated that the prepared samples were stable in the 4 ?C temperature. Increase of lecithin concentration increased turbidity. It was observed that the viscosity not changed by increasing the shear rate (Newtonian behavior), suggesting a nonflocculated system with very small particle size pointing toward the stability of the system.

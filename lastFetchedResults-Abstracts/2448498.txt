Estimation and characterisation of the neutron-induced radioactivity in fusion reactor materials is the basis for their classification in view of radiotoxicity. In the present study has been performed evaluations of Clearance Index (CI), Contact Dose (CD) and Decay Heat Rate (HR) for a European DEMO concept based on HCLL blanket technology, including their time behaviour and significance of particular nuclides. The main objective was to determine the activation of the various materials and components in order to quantify the amount and characteristics of wastes from the DEMO machine. Calculations of induced activity in the system, indicated sometimes the dominant contribution of very rare reactions or nuclides with hundreds years of decay. Activation and decay heat levels of the components were calculated with the use of FISPACT-2007 and EAF-2007 library, on the basis of neutron fluxes throughout the structures of the tokamak calculated with the use of MCNP and the DEMO model from CCFE. The final material balance was assessed as well.

The European VPH-Share project develops a comprehensive service framework with the objective of sharing clinical data, information, models and workflows focusing on the analysis of the human physiopathology within the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) community. The project envisions an extensive and dynamic data infrastructure built on top of a secure hybrid Cloud environment. This paper presents the data service provisioning framework that builds up the data infrastructure, focusing on the deployment of data integration services in the hybrid Cloud, the associated mechanism for securing access to patient-specific datasets, and performance results for different deployment scenarios relevant within the scope of the project.

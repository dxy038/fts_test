Organizations have come to realize that it makes sense to converge their voice and data networks. A single Internet protocol (IP) network infrastructure that carries voice signals as well as digital data can be installed, maintained, and managed much more easily, and less expensively, than separate voice and data networks. However, implementing new applications such as voice on an existing network is not an easy task as plug and play. Successful VoIP deployment needs proper planning and understanding of the current network traffic, and of the implementation of the VoIP and its technology. The objective of this dissertation is to investigate and evaluate the capability of a campus network to carry voice traffic on the network. The study is focused on the factors, such as delay, jitter, packet loss, bandwidth availability, etc., that affect the performance of the network and voice quality. Since the network to be tested is not available, a model resembling a real campus network was used and simulated using OPNET simulated under three different traffic loads. Comparisons were made to evaluate the performance and voice quality based on the outcome obtained from the simulations

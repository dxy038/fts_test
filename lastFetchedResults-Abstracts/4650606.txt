In this paper, a coupled circuit model of Linear Induction Motor based on electromagnetic field analysis is presented. Also, the motor parameters are calculated employing the concept of winding function. The end effect automatically appears in the equivalent circuit model. Moreover, an optimization procedure of Linear Induction Motor is employed for improving performance. Hence, we define three variables, including height of slot, width of slot and thickness of the secondary sheet to create initial objective function. Afterward, employing Response Surface Methodology and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm, the objective function is optimized for improving the Linear Induction Motor performance. Finally, the Finite Element Method is employed to verify the results of the optimization. The results show improvement in the performance of the Linear Induction Motor.

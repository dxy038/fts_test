This paper proposed an issue that among the objectives it need to weight to reflect the different importance in the fuzzy multi-objective programming. Established a fuzzy multi-objective programming model with preference weight. Taking into account many decision-makers participating in evaluation, gave a method which made the preference information set of different forms assembled into group preference, and applied integrated weight into the fuzzy multi-objective programming. Finally, examples are given in this paper to verify the effectiveness of the model and method.

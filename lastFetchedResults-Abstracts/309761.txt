Objective:
We investigated the prevalence of asymptomatic pyuria (ASP) in diabetic patients and compared the Sysmex UF-100 with Fuchsâ€“Rosenthal hemacytometer.
Design and methods:
ASP prevalence was investigated in 227 diabetic patients. Imprecision, accuracy and correlation of UF-100 with hemacytometer in measuring leukocyte counts were determined.
Results:
Diabetic women and men had significantly higher ASP prevalence than non-diabetic women (21.4 vs. 8.7%) and men (12.2 vs. 3.4%). Disease duration and HbA1C levels were similar in diabetic patients with and without ASP. UF-100 and hemacytometer readings correlated significantly (r = 0.88) without a significant bias. Within-run coefficients of variations for UF-100 (8.14, 6.35 and 12.18%) and hemacytometer (5.14, 5.18 and 8.03%) did not differ significantly.
Conclusions:
Prevalence of ASP is increased in diabetic patients and not affected by duration of disease or control of hyperglycemia. UF-100 seemed to be a reliable, precise and accurate system to determine pyuria.

In the traditional logging optimization processing methods, logging response equations are built based on the homogeneous, layered and isotropic formation model, they are not suitable for the heterogeneous and anisotropic fractured-vuggy reservoirs. A new optimization processing method aimed at the fractured-vuggy reservoir was presented and its accuracy was confirmed through simulation calculation and actual logging data processing. The logging response equations and objective function for logging optimization problem were built based on the heterogeneous fractured-vuggy reservoir model. Then, the solving algorithm combining penalty function method with Levenberg-Marquardt method was implemented, which had less calculation and high efficiency. The result of simulation calculation shows that the solving algorithm is less affected by the initial value, and the global optimal solution can be gained with random initial values, which meets the needs of logging evaluation. Finally, the proposed approach was applied to the real data processing. Comparison results show that the new method is more accurate than the traditional ones, and it also has a good consistency with the result of core analysis.

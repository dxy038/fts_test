This paper discusses the development of a new optimization algorithm for DC motor design. In principle, the new algorithm utilizes a mixed method that consists of genetic algorithms in conjunction with direct search method. The genetic algorithms are used for locating the global optimum region while the direct search method is used to achieve objective function convergence. In order to validate the effectiveness, the new algorithm has been applied to an actual DC motor. Field and torque characteristics of the DC motor are computed using the finite element method and the principle of virtual work, respectively

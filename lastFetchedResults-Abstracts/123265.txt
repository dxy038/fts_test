The subject of the Zagros basement has been discussed for a long time; but the Zagros basement rotation and its movement from Minab to Qatar-Kazerun faults has been discussed only in few papers without any attention to its details.
The main objective of this paper is calculation of real distribution of linear movement in the basement from Minab to Qatar-Kazerun faults. Since any correct and basic model of the region structures should be based on real data, therefore at first, we proved the basement rotation by studying the whole existing features. Then the rate of rotational movement for Saudi of Arabia plate, based on geometrical movement theories and calculated velocities of the opening and displacement in the Red sea and Gulf of Aden was measured.
Finally, by adding the vectors of displacement and rotational movement of basement, the distribution of linear movement for different points of basement was determined.

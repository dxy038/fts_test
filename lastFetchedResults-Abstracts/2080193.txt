Objective
ition to its role as a remineralizing agent in preventing dental caries, calcium product (CPP–ACP) delivered as a mousse (Tooth Mousse®, TM) can reduce erosion of enamel and dentine. The aim of this study was to determine whether CPP–ACP could also reduce erosive tooth wear involving toothbrush abrasion.
s
polished enamel and dentine specimens (n = 72) were subjected to 10 wear regimes, with each regime involving erosion in 0.3% citric acid (pH 3.2) for 10 min followed by toothbrush abrasion in a slurry of fluoride-free toothpaste and artificial saliva (1:3 ratio by weight) under a load of 2N for 200 cycles. The specimens were immersed in artificial saliva for 2 h between wear regimes. In the experimental group 1, TM (containing CPP–ACP) was applied at the beginning of each wear episode for 5 min whereas TM− (without CPP–ACP) was applied in the experimental group 2. No mousse was applied in the control group.
s
nificantly reduced enamel wear (mean ± S.E., 1.26 ± 0.33 μm in the experimental group 1 vs 3.48 ± 0.43 μm in the control group) and dentine wear (2.16 ± 0.89 μm in the experimental group 1 vs 10.29 ± 1.64 μm in the control group), and dentine wear was significantly less in the experimental group 1 than in the experimental group 2 (5.75 ± 0.98 μm).
sion
nding that TM reduced erosive tooth wear involving toothbrush abrasion, probably by remineralizing and lubricating eroded tooth surfaces, may have implications in the management of tooth wear.

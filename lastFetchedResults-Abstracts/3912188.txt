This article describes state of the art methods developed by IEC TC-10 WG-37 for quantitative determination of a highly corrosive sulfur compound dibenzodisulfide (DBDS) and other corrosive sulfur compounds in unused and used insulating liquids. The methods permit an objective approach for assessing corrosiveness of insulating liquids rather than subjective assessment based on color perception that is prevalent in the current standard test methods for corrosive or potentially corrosive sulfur in insulating liquids. In addition, quantification of total corrosive sulfur (TCS) in insulating liquids permits an objective ranking of sulfur compounds according to their corrosivity towards copper.

This paper deals with overlapping clustering, a trade off between crisp and fuzzy clustering. It has been motivated by recent applications in various domains such as information retrieval or biology. We show that the problem of finding a suitable coverage of data by overlapping clusters is not a trivial task. We propose a new objective criterion and the associated algorithm OKM that generalizes the k-means algorithm. Experiments show that overlapping clustering is a good alternative and indicate that OKM outperforms other existing methods.

Automation of transportation systems and promotion of the operations are becoming an international demand on seaport container terminals. For this issue, we propose an integrated design methodology. In other words, in addition to the design of the appropriate number of machines, efficient system layout, and system management models, we attempt to design machines´ specifications, which are operating in an automated transportation system. The objective of this study is to maximize the system efficiency while minimizing the changes of the specifications. Therefore, we evaluate the specifications based on the system throughput of the constructed system; then, make clear the impacts of the specifications on the system. Finally, for imposed demands, we design highly efficient transportation systems. From the construction costs and design results, we show a need to take into consideration the machines´ specifications.

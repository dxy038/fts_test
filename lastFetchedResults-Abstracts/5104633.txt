The main objective of this paper is to control the speed of separately excited DC Motor using a Sliding mode controller based on VSS approach. This controller is based on variable structure systems which aim at reducing the peak overshoot, steady state error and settling time of a DC Motor. In the first stage, PI controller is used to control the speed of DC Motor. A model is developed and simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Later on the same is done with sliding mode controller. The speed control of DC Motor using both PI and Sliding mode controllers is studied and the results are compared. The simulation results show that Sliding mode controller is superior than PI for speed control of DC motor. Since the SMC is robust in presence of disturbances, the desired speed is perfectly tracked.

ITALSCAR is a burned "Burned Forest Mapping from Space" project requested by the Italian Department of Civil Protection and funded by the European Space Agency under the framework of its Data User Programme (DUP), with the primary aim of developing operative answers to National Civil Protection Agencies needs regarding Burn Scars Mapping. The main goal of the project was the generation of reference Burn Scars Maps (BSM) and the associated catalogue, over the entire Italian territory for 4 consecutive years, with the objective to support the operational Fire Disaster Management in Italy. The project aimed also at providing a reference framework for similar European initiatives that would be undertaken at national and at regional levels. The paper highlights the major findings of the project and evidences the way forward for developing a regional burn scar mapping service in the Mediterranean ecosystem.

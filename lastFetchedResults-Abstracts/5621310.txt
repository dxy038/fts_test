Using genetic algorithm to resolve dynamic production scheduling problem of flexible job shop is presented. A math model and objective function for dynamic scheduling of flexible job shop is set up by analysis problem of flexible job shop scheduling and restrictive condition is research. A genetic operator that can meet the need of production scheduling of flexible job shop is designed based on working procedure coding. Coding, crossover, mutation, fitness calculation, controls parameter selection and stop condition is studied. Based on those simulation is carry out and the result of it show correctness and validity of arithmetic.

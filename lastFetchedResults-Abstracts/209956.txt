Objective: Gesture s of the hands and anus have long been
observed to accompany speech in spontaneous conversation.
However, the way in which these two mode s of expression
are related in production is not yet fully understood. So, the
present study aims to investigate the spontaneous gestures that
accompany speech in adults who stutter in comparison to fluent
controls.
Materials & Methods: In this cross -sectional and comparative
research, ten adult s who stutter were selected randomly from
speech and language pathology clinics and compared with ten
healthy person s as control group who were matched with stutterers
according to sex, age and education. The cartoon story-retelling task
used to e lici t spo ntaneo us ges ture s th at accompa ny sp eech.
Participants were asked to watch the animation carefully and then
retell the storyline in as much detail as possible to a listener sitt ing
across from him or her and his or her narration was video recorded
simultaneously. Then recorded utterances and gesture s were analyzed .
The statistical methods such as Kolmogorov- Srnirnov and Independent
t-test were used for data analyzing .
Results: The results indicated that stutterers in comparison to controls
in averag e use fewer iconic ges tures in their narrati on (P=O.OOS). Also,
stutterers in comparison to controls in averag e use fewer iconic ges tures
per each utterance and word (P=O.O19). Furth ermore, the execution of
gesture production durin g moments of dysfluency revealed that more than
70% of the ges tures produced with stuttering were frozen or abandoned
at the moment of dysfluency.
Conclusion: It seems ges ture and speech have such an intricate and deep
association that show similar frequency and timing pattern s and move
completely parallel to each other in such a way that defi cit in speec h
results in deficiency in hand gesture.

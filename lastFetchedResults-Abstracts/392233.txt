Objective: the cochlea is innervated by the sympathetic nerve fibers. However, the functions of those fibers in the cochlea are still controversial. The present study was designed to determine whether the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) exerts a protective or enhancing effect on acoustic trauma. Methods: acoustic overstimulation (either of 110, 115, or 130 dB SPL for 10 min) was performed in guinea pigs during electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral cervical SNS, after its surgical elimination or in the non-treated condition. The threshold shift of the compound action potential (CAP) from the pre-exposure value was measured at 1 h and at 1 week after acoustic overstimulation. Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were completed for the SNS conditions and the frequencies. Results: although no significant difference was found at 1 h after overstimulation among these three groups, the CAP threshold shift at 1 week (110 and 115 dB SPL) was significantly smaller in the SNS stimulation group than in the other two groups. Conclusion: a protective effect was observed in the SNS stimulation group 1 week after the exposure to acoustic overstimulation of moderate intensity (from 110 to 115 dB SPL for 10 min).

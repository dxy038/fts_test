This paper describes a new methodology that might be useful to develop a model for comparing the present operational readiness of a video system with the same systemÂ´s past performance. It provides the results of a study conducted to determine the feasibility of developing a video performance model using the ANSI committee TlA1.5 measures to allow the monitoring of video service performance across time. Based on the results of this study it is concluded that the performance measures can be used to develop an objective model of video service performance

Cooperative and distributed relocation strategy of multi-robot systems is a critical matter in self-reconfigurable modular robotic systems. In this paper, we depict a flexible distributed redeployment algorithm to relocate a large collection of micro-robots according to a list of desired final positions. Our algorithm is based on novel mechanisms reducing the need for global synchronization. The focus is made on the cooperative aspects that control all robots, each one animated by an individual objective, and collaborates in order to achieve the relocation objective. We show results from simulations on an open source multi-robot simulator.

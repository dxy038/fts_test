In mobile networks, when the mobile terminal (MT) has an active call while crossing the boundary of two systems, it is required that the existing connection should not be lost. To meet this demand, the signalling protocol of mobility management must be designed for supporting location registration and call delivery for roaming users who move beyond their home network. The objective of this study is to provide a modified boundary location register (MBLR) signalling protocol for inter-system roaming. The idea of generating routing number in advance plays a key role for the proposal. The location registration and call delivery process of the new protocol are proposed which tries to reduce the signalling cost and latency. An analytical model is developed for comparative performance analysis of the boundary location register and MBLR protocol. However, this will result in increased processing requirements at the database server. Thus, trade-off between signalling, database access costs and processing overheads must be recognised.

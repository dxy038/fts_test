Objective: Th e goal of this study was to design and manufacture
the novel spider splint and compare its effect with conventional
metalli c splint on impro vement of hand function in pati ents with
radial nerv e injury .
Material & Methods: In thi s quasi experimental study, 24 patient s
with radial nerve injury from clinics of Sina and Imam Khomeini
hospitals who were randomly sel ected and assigned into two group s
by balanced randomized method, were treated with new splint and
conventional metallic splint. For the first visit range of mot ion at Wrist,
Metacarpophalangeal , Proximal interph alange ai and Di stal
interphalangeal jo int s was measured and evaluated the comfortance level
and skin eczema . After 4 months follow up the vari ables was evalu ated
again. Data were anal yzed by Chi square and Independent T tests.
Results: The range of motion ofjoints at Wrist (p<O.OOI ), Metacarpophalangeal
(p=0 .003) and Proximal interphalang eal (p=0 .02 9) were
significantly more in spider splint group thant other group, but there was
no significant difference in range of motion of Distal interphalangeal joint
(p=O.054 ), although function impro vement ofDistal interphalangeal joint
was better too in spider splint group than oth er gr oup.
Conclusion: The new splint and conventional metallic splint were
effective on improvement ofradial nerve probl ems (fingers disextension,
drop wrist and secondary deformity) , but new splint was more effe cti ve
on hand function improvement.

A set of parameters to assess the objective quality of visualizations of a voxel-based data set, produced using a ray caster, is proposed as a first step toward the evaluation of the overall quality of these visualizations. Results obtained using synthetic data and a simple implementation of a ray caster are presented. The final goal of this evaluation is the computation of &#8220;confidence indices&#8221; that could offer the user a &#8220;guided visualization&#8221;, i.e. allow him/her to decide what are the &#8220;best&#8221; visualizations of a data set

In this paper, a multi-objective multi-period multi-product supply chain network design problem is introduced. This problem is modeled
using a multi-objective mixed integer mathematical programming. The objectives are: maximizing the total profit of logistics, maximizing
service level, and minimizing inconsistency of operations. Several sets of constraints are considered to handle the real situations of threeechelon
supply chains. As the optimum value of conflicting objective functions of the proposed model cannot be met concurrently, a goal
programming approach is used for that matter. An illustrative numerical example is provided to show the mechanism of the proposed
model and the solution procedure. In a numerical example, 1 manufacture, 2 warehouses, 2 distribution centers (DCs), and 2 types of final
products are considered in a planning horizon consisting of 3 time periods. Products are shipped from the manufacturer to warehouses, and
then are shipped from the two warehouses to two distribution centers. The distribution centers are the points from which products are
shipped to final consumers. The Model is coded using GAMS software on a Core i7 CPU, using 8GB of RAM with MS-Windows 8.0. The
optimum design of supply chain, inventory level for warehouses and distributors, and amount of shipments between echelons are
determined.

Background & Objective: High levels of assertiveness and low levels of
anxiety are important factors that result in suitable communication. They
also increase intellectual abilities, abstract thought, power & autonomy, and
personal well-being among nursing and midwifery students. The aim of this
study was to determine the relationship between assertiveness and anxiety
among midwifery and nursing students.
Methods & Materials: In this correlational, cross-sectional study, 173
nursing students (68 males & 105 females) were recruited using census and
rational methods. Seventy seven midwifery students were also recruited
using census method. Data were collected using a self-report tool including
"personal information form", "Trait Spilberger Anxiety", and "Assertion
Inventory" (AI) of Gambrill & Richey. Data were analyzed using
descriptive and inferential statistical methods.
Results: Results showed that more than half of the nursing and midwifery
students (59.5% and 59.7%, respectively) had moderate assertiveness. Also,
43.3% and 36.4% of them had moderate and high levels of anxiety. Pearson
correlation test revealed that assertiveness and anxiety had negative
correlations in nursing (r=-0.51, P<0.001) and midwifery (r=-0.449,
P<0.001) students. Some demographic variables had significant correlations
with assertiveness and anxiety among the students.
Conclusion: Regarding the relationship between assertiveness and anxiety
and their effect on mental health, as well as educational and occupational
functions of the students, more attention is needed to pay to theses issues.
Also, it seems that appropriate interventions should be planned to increase
assertiveness and to decrease anxiety among the students

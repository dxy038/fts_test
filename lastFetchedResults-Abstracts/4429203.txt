A neural tissue interfacing chip for in-vitro applications is presented based on an extended 0.5 &#956;m, 5 V, standard CMOS process. The chip provides 256 &#215; 128 bidirectional recording / stimulation sites on a total active area of 2.28 mm &#215; 1.14 mm, and a fully digital interface. Full frame recording rate is 2.4 kHz. Selection of a subset of sites is possible and translates into higher bandwidth per site accordingly. Electrical and biological results are presented which reveal proper functionality.

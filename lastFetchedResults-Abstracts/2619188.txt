The main structure of the research in the form of content analysis by way of interpretation - account, through collecting and describing information is based on library studies done. This article first introduces the nanotechnology using existing literature in this field and the definition of Nanvmmary and introduce existing approaches to produce Nanwbnyan materials in architecture, to introduce the technology areas of the construction industry nano, the source is influencing them, and that in this regard an example of the use of applications Nanvbnyan materials in a house in the form of a schematic image is examined. The main objective of this writing, getting to know different areas of construction professionals (architects, structural engineers, plant engineers and builders) with the perceived potential of nanotechnology in construction.

Background: Bronchopneumonia is the leading cause of child death worldwide, causing the deaths of more than 2 million of underprivileged and poor children every year. Objective: The aim of this study was to detect values of laser therapy addition to inspiratory muscle training and postural drainage in management of children with bronchopneumonia. Material and Methods: Forty children with bronchopneumonia, their age ranged between 3 to 5 years and were included into 2 equal groups; group (A) received low intensity laser therapy, inspiratory muscle training using incentive spirometer associated with postural drainage in addition to medical treatment at a frequency of 3 sessions per week for one month. The second group (B) received inspiratory muscle training using incentive spirometer associated with postural drainage in addition to medical treatment. Measurements of IgG, WBCs, CRP and SaO2 were obtained for both groups before treatment and after one month at the end of the treatment program. Results: The mean values of WBCs and CRP were significantly lower, where the mean values of IgG, and SaO were significantly higher in both groups after treatments. There were significant differences between mean levels of the investigated parameters in group (A) and group (B) after treatment. Conclusion: Laser acupuncture therapy added to inspiratory muscle training combined postural drainage is of value in management of children with bronchopneumonia

Reasonable effort should be made to remove all past references to this paper.<br/><br/>The presenting author of this paper has the option to appeal this decision by contacting TPII@ieee.org.<br/><br/>In order to overcome the casualness in the traditional urban rail transit ticket type settings, solve the problem that the kinds of ticket types are too many to difficult to decide, the paper will classify the rail transit tickets into five types including inevitable type, attracting passengers type, value-added type, relate to concessions type and innovative type based on cluster analysis method. On the basis, it will establish multiple objective decision making model, use Multiple Objective Grey Relational Grade judgment matrix to calculate the relational vectors between designed ticket types and best ticket types, so as to obtain the selecting sequence of tickets under each type. Finally, it will give the suggestions of ticket type settings in different operation stage of urban rail transit. The results showed that: the result of cluster analysis is scientific and rational, and it can be used as the basis for multi-objective decision-making, multi-objective decision-making results can be theoretical basis for urban rail transit operating decision-makers.

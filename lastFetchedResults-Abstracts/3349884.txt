Experiments with wireless sensor networks have shown that asymmetric and unidirectional links occur often. Protocols that detect these links on the link layer have been proposed, however, unidirectional links represent a challenge as well as a chance across all layers. Still, most routing protocols prefer to use only bidirectional links. In this paper we present Unidirectional Link Counter, a routing protocol that collects information about the unidirectional links on a path to make routing decisions. The collected information can furthermore be used for more effective neighborhood management and better quality estimation.

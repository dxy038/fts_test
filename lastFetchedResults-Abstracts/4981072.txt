Summary form only given. Adaptive robust control (ARC) is a synergistic combination of adaptive control and deterministic robust control (DRC). It provides a robust performance with predictable transients while avoiding chattering typical in DRC. Anti-integration windup mechanism is built in the ARC and thus the problem of control saturation is alleviated. In this paper, ARC is applied to the motion control of machine tools, the objective of which is to assure a robust high speed and high accuracy tracking (contouring) performance in the presence of uncertainties due to inertia and friction variations. The ARC design is compared with the disturbance observer design by experiments performed on a Matsuura 510VSS high speed vertical machining center. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and improved performance obtained via the ARC design.

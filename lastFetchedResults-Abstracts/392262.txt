Objective: The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) produces compensatory eye movements during head movements. The VOR consists of the angular VOR and the linear VOR. The VOR is under adaptive control that corrects VOR performance when visual-vestibular mismatch arises during head movements. Most experiments concerning plasticity of the VOR have used the angular VOR. So far, there has been no investigation on the effect of adaptive plasticity of the linear VOR on the angular VOR. In this study, using a linear sled, we tested the hypothesis that the angular VOR is altered by changes in the linear VOR. Methods: To modify the linear VOR, we used an adaptation paradigm. Eight subjects were translated sinusoidally at 0.125 Hz and 0.16 g peak acceleration along their inter-aural axis for 40 min, while viewing earth-fixed vertical stripes on the wall while wearing the binocular magnifying lenses. Six of the eight subjects showed an increase in linear VOR sensitivity after adaptation. Each of the six subjects who showed an increase in linear VOR sensitivity after adaptation also showed an increased angular VOR gain at 0.125 Hz. Conclusion: These results suggest that the linear VOR and the angular VOR share common neural pathways in such a way that a change in the synaptic efficacy of one pathway is accompanied by a commensurate change in the other.

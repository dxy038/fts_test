Objective.
To determine patient acceptance of a preventive care model employing outreach by non-physician experts outside of clinic visits.
Methods.

Questionnaire completed in 2005 by patients in the waiting room of an academic general medicine practice associated with the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. Topics included the role of primary care providers in coordinating health care; interest in being contacted by non-PCPs between visits; and willingness to communicate with such experts by phone, e-mail, and internet.
Results.

95% of the patients completed the survey (n = 354). 93% of these affirmed either that requiring primary care provider involvement in preventive health care is not always necessary, is inconvenient, or represents an unnecessary expense. More than 70% were open to a non-PCP-centered method of receiving preventive services. Socioeconomically disadvantaged patients and those with poorer self-rated health, however, were less likely to express interest in the concept.
Conclusion.

Our patients were open to a non-traditional model of delivering preventive care. This model could improve delivery of preventive services. In instituting this system, it would be important to pay close attention to the concerns of vulnerable populations.

The design and experimental characterisation of a short-stroke, bidirectional linear actuator
capable of operating in ambient temperatures up to 800Â°C is presented. The merits of various
candidate actuator topologies and soft magnetic materials are discussed. The design and analysis of a
bidirectional actuator with a nominal force rating of 300N and a stroke of 20.5" is described,
embracing electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical aspects. Extensive experimental measurements on
a prototype actuator are presented and compared with finite-element predicted performance over the
full operating temperature range of the actuator.

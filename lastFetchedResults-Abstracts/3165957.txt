This paper presents a nonparametric method for the computation of tolerance intervals for hybrid time series, based on bootstrap techniques. The approach is here used to obtain reference limits for blood pressure in clinical health. Such limit may serve for an objective and positive definition of health, for the screening and diagnosis of disease, and for gauging the subjectÂ´s response to treatment.<sup>1</sup>

This paper examines engineering bioinformatics as a meaningful paradigm to complement modern nanotechnology. We consider bioinformatics as a coherent abstraction in devising, prototyping, design, optimization and analysis of complex nanosystems. Nano- and microscale biological systems exist in nature in enormous variety and sophistication. We are applying complex biological patterns in order to devise, analyze and examine distinct systems. One cannot blindly copy biosystems due to the fact that many complex phenomena and effects have not been comprehended, and system architectures and functionalities have not been fully examined. Typical examples include unsolved problems to comprehend the simplest Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Salmonella typhimurium bacteria that integrate three-dimensional biocircuitry, computing-processing-networking nanobioelectronics, nanobiomotors, nanabio-sensors, etc. Correspondingly, attention should be concentrated on devising novel paradigms in systematic synthesis through bioinformatics with the ultimate objective to fabricate these systems applying nanotechnology. This will allow one to derive new operating principles examining functionality of different subsystems, researching novel structures, studying advanced architectures (topologies) and characterizing distinct systems, subsystems, and devices reaching the nanoarchitectronics horizon. This paper examines complex patterns in biosystems because superior systems can be devised and designed through engineering bioinformatics. Our ultimate objective is to provide the focused study of engineering bioinformatics and systematic design. These are far-reaching frontiers of modern nanoscience and nanoengineering. The synergetic paradigm reported is demonstrated researching biosystems and coherently examining distinct nanostructures, complexes and subsystems.

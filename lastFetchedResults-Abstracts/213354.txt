Background: Sodium arsenite and! or vasectomy may cause variation in sex hormones
which affect pathophysiology of reproductive organs.
Objective: The aim was to investigate the morphological changes in structure of testis
and hormonal imbalance in bilateral Vasectomised rats treated with sodium arsenite.
Materials and Methods: Four groups of rats: bilateral vasectomy + sodium arsenite,
bilateral vasectomy, sham operated + sodium arsenite and sham operated only were
considered, and 8 mglkg! day of sodium arsenite was given for 8 weeks to the rats. The
total volume of testis, volume of interstitial tissue, volume of seminiferous tubules,
diameter of seminiferous tubules and germinal epithelium thickness were evaluated
using stereological methods. Hormones were also measured and the results were
analyzed using one way ANOVA.
Results: A significant reduction of total volume of testis (p<O.OI), mean volume of
seminiferous tubules (p<O.002) as well as germinal epithelium thickness (p<O.05) in
both vasectomy + sodium arsenite and vasectomy rats was seen compared to sham
operated only. In addition a significant reduction of testosterone was observed in
vasectomy + sodium arsenite group when compared to the other groups (p<O.OOI). LH
level decreased significantly in vasectomy + sodium arsenite when compared to sham
operated ones (p<O.05).
Conclusion: Vasectomy and treatment with sodium arsenite affect the structure of testis
with respect to its volume, volume of seminiferous tubules and thickness of germinal
epithelium, which may be due to variation ofLH and testosterone level in the rats.

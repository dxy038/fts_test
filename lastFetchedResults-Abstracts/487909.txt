The main objective of this study was to investigate the treatment of distillery vinasse through the integrated process of ozone oxidation and Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) in a continuous process. The continuous process was carried out both by each of the GAC and ozone processes alone and by the combination of the two in order to investigate the synergistic effects of the two modes on COD and color removal in the treatment of vinasse from laboratory ethanol production from cane molasses. The continuous processes were performed at an ozone generation rate of 240mg/h, GAC dose of lOOg, and at room temperature (25Â°C). Color removal efficiency of 03 was higher than its COD removal from vinasse. The COD and color removal efficiencies of the 03 process were about 25% and 74%, respectively. Moreover, GAC/O3 process was found to negatively affect the synergy of COD and color removal efficiency from distillery vinasse. This negative effect decreased by increasing influent pH level. The results indicate that the initial pH has a considerable effect on the three processes investigated.

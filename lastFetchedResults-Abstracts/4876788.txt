In this paper, we will characterize the operation of fast charging infrastructures equipped with renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage to optimize the pattern of charging and selling power to the grid according to price variations to maximize the objective function that is benefit of participating in the electricity market. 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data set has been utilized in several ways to probabilistically quantify the Plug-in Electric VehiclesÂ´ (PEV) status in order to characterize their real-time mobility behavior. Analysis based on the level of forecast uncertainty is considered. The result shows the effectiveness of the optimization method.

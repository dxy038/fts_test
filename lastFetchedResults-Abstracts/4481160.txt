This paper proposes a 3D-2D registration method to determine the pose of a camera from an uncalibrated image of a given 3D model. Through the combined use of global silhouette comparison and local feature point matching, the camera pose of a 2D photograph can be accurately determined by minimising a hybird objective function. The registered photos can be used to stitch textures or refine the geometry of 3D models. This method can be used independently or collaboratively in image-based modeling systems to effectively treat restrictive camera-model position configurations. The experiment shows that our method is more flexible than the methods using only geometrical or local feature information.

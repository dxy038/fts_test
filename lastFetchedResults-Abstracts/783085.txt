Background There is increasing recognition
of the importance of psychiatric vocational rehabilitation
(PVR) programmes in helping individuals with severe
mental illnesses to find and secure jobs. However,
little is known concerning the factors related to PVR
outcomes.Objective This review identifies those personrelated
factors which most strongly influence employment
outcomes after participation in PVR programmes.
Method Medline, Psychinfo, Pubmed and CINAHL were
searched for studies using multivariate analysis of longitudinal
data, which analysed employment outcomes
after at least 6 months of programme participation, and
which analysed at least three predictor domains. Results
Eight studies presented in 16 publications met all the
criteria. Better employment outcomes were most
strongly related to better work performance measured
during PVR participation and to higher work-related
self-efficacy. Better social functioning during PVR participation
was also significantly related to positive employment
outcomes, but this relationship was generally
weaker than those of the two aforementioned factors. In
most studies,employment outcomes after PVR were not
related to past functioning, including work history and
diagnosis. Findings on the severity of psychiatric symptoms
measured during PVR were mixed. In terms of
contribution to outcome, severity of symptoms usually
ranked below work performance, when measured concurrently.
Conclusion Contrary to previous reviews, this
study suggests that the influence of past functioning, including
work history, diagnosis and psychiatric history,
is outweighed by work performance in PVR. Further
prospective and controlled studies are needed to reach
more definite conclusions about the individual contributions
of person-related factors.

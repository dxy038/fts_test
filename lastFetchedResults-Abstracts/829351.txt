Drought is considered as one of the most deleterious and life threatening phenomenon. The objective of this study was to determine the changes of seed yield and yield components of Barley ,s genotypes, under drought stress condition, an experiment was conducted at Kabotarabad Agriculture Research Station in 2011 (Latitude 32o30/ N, longitude 51o49/ E, and 1541 m elevation). These two experiments were done separately, by combined analysis within complete block design with 3 replications, 10 genotypes were studied at drought stress condition (Irrigation disruption after emergence of spikes) and normal water irrigation. In three experimental characteristics, namely seed yield, biological and harvest index were obtained in stress condition, which had significant differences with normal condition. Drought stress during vegetative and reproductive growth reduced seed yield and yield components of sesame and the main factor in yield reduction was plant height and increase the number of days from germination until spike formation and physiological ripening. Short duration water deficits during the rapid vegetative growth period caused significant loss of final seed yield, biological yield and harvest index in barley. In conclusion, complete irrigation is needed at all growth stages to maintain and enhance crop yield, moreover, irrigation is critical during flowering phase in order to improve seed yield.

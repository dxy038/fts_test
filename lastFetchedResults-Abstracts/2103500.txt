Increasing of greenhouse gas emissions is one of the major concerns in the international community. 50 percent of increment of carbon dioxide concentration, which is forming the most of greenhouse gas, was occurred during the last fifty years. Because of impermeable caprock, hydrocarbon reservoirs are appropriate option to sequester carbon dioxide. On the other hand, due to high amount of fuel consumption in the world, implementing carbon dioxide Enhance Oil Recovery (CO2 EOR) to improve oil recovery is logical. So, to achieve these aims, using efficient method to improve the volumes of produced oil and stored carbon dioxide is mandatory. Up to now, due to lack of proper method, single objective optimization method was conducted. Nowadays, using multi objective optimization methods such as non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm leads to select appropriate scenario during encountering upcoming situations. In this study, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm was applied to an oil reservoir and some appropriate scenarios with regard to maximization of produced oil volume and stored carbon dioxide volume were introduced. The main advantage of this methodology is selection of proper scenario with regard to economic variations after implementing optimization process.

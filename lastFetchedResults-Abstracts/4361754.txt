A confocal microendoscope for in situ optical biopsy has been developed. The system couples a slit-scan confocal fluorescence microscope to an optical catheter, consisting of a coherent fiber-optic imaging bundle, or a fiber bundle with a miniature objective and hydraulic focusing mechanism. The confocal microendoscope provides adequate image quality to visualize individual cells and subcellular structures. Vital fluorescent dyes are used with the system as selective stains for histopathologic evaluation of disease

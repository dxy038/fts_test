In real life facial expressions show mixture of emotions. This paper proposes a novel expression descriptor based expression map that can efficiently represent pure, mixture and transition of facial expressions. The expression descriptor is the integration of optic flow and image gradient values and the descriptor value is accumulated in temporal scale. The expression map is realized using self-organizing map. We develop an objective scheme to find the percentage of different prototypical pure emotions (e.g., happiness, surprise, disgust etc.) that mix up to generate a real facial expression. Experimental results show that the expression map can be used as an effective classifier for facial expressions.

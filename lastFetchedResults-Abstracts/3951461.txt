Abstract-A bidirectional wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) transport system base on two reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers (RSOAs) and optoelectronic feedback technique is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. One RSOA is employed as a broadband light source and another RSOA in combination with optoelectronic feedback technique is used as wavelengths reuse and data signal remodulation scheme. System architecture is further simplified by using only one RSOA at the optical node, and system performance is further improved by optoelectronic feedback technique. Impressive performances of bit error rate (BER) (&lt;;10<sup>-9</sup>) were achieved for both 2.5 Gbps down-link and 1.25 Gbps up-link transmissions.

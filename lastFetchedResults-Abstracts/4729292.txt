It is well established that motor action/imagery provokes an event-related desynchronization (ERD) response at specific brain areas with specific frequency ranges, typically the sensory motor rhythm and beta bands. However, there are individual differences in both brain areas and frequency ranges which can be used to identify ERD. This often results in low classification accuracy of ERD, which makes it difficult to implement of BCI application such as the control of external devices and motor rehabilitation. To overcome this problem, an individually optimized solution may be desirable for enhancing the accuracy of detecting motor action/imagery with ERD rather than a global solution for all BCI users. This paper presents a method based on a genetic algorithm to find individually optimized brain areas and frequency ranges for ERD classification. To optimize these two components, we designed a chromosome consisting of 64-bit elements represented by a binary number and another 9-bit elements using 512 pre-defined frequency ranges (2^9). The average value of the significant level is set for the properties of the objective function for use in a t-test, (p &lt;;; 0.01) depending on the random selection from a concurrent population. As a result, contralateral ERD responses in the spatial domain with individually optimized frequency ranges showed a significant difference between resting and motor action. The ERD responses for motor imagery, on the other hand, led to a bilateral pattern with a narrow frequency band compared to motor action. This study provides the possibility of selecting optimized electrode positions and frequency bands which can lead to high levels of ERD classification accuracy.

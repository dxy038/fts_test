Major benefit expected from wind generation is reducing the consumption of fossil resources and consequentially reducing the emission of green-house gas. Such reduction is realized by having some of the conventional generators entirely displaced or part-loaded, the generation capacity is then replaced by wind. However, due to intermittent nature of wind energy, the displacement will reduce the reliable continuity of generation in the system. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied in this research work to compute the optimal displacement allocation among the connected generators when the significant wind energy penetrates into the system to displace the conventional units. The objective function is the generation outage probability. It is expected that by applying PSO the optimal allocation of displaced amount can be found in the manner that it minimizes the effect to the system reliability.

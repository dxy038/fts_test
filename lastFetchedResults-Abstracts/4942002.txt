The simple trust evaluation methods that result in a final trust level (FTL) value canÂ´t be able to evaluate service trust trend (STT). Furthermore, statistical trust values include some unfair and questionable trust values caused by subjective or objective factors. In response to these problems in trust management, an approach called two-way trust evaluation based on feedback is presented. This approach adopted the fitting a-ary quadratic trend curve to evaluate STT. According to the fitting a-ary quadratic trend curve, replace unfair and questionable trust values with STT expectations. Meanwhile, send feedbacks for these clients who sent unfair and questionable trust values to the trust management system and realize two-way trust evaluation based on these feedbacks. Experimental data show that this approach is able to evaluate STT, lessen the trust evaluation errors and enhance the fairness and rationality of trust evaluation.

OBJECTIVE: The coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries: Since there is a relationship between dermatoglyphic pattern and some diseases, this study was done to investigate the relationship between dermatoglyphic pattern and myocardial infarction.
METHODS: This study was done on 900 patients with myocardial infarction referred to hospitals in Babol, Sari and Gorgan. Biopsy was done on 900 persons without myocardial infarction as a control group. After diagnosing of type and location of myocardial infarction, fingerprints were taken and an expert explained samples in details. Then obtained results were statistically analyzed by Chi-square and Z- test.
FINDINGS: The types of fingerprint were arch, loop and whorl in 7.2% , 46.8% and 46% of patients respectively. In contrast, in control group, they were 3.7%, 50.7% and 45.5% respectively. There was a significant difference between two groups in arch type. Also, there was an increase in arch type of fingerprint of left thumb, forefinger and ringfinger (p<0.0001 ).
CONCLUSION: According to the results, there was a significant relationship between arch types of fingerprint and the incidence of MI, especially in left thumb, forefinger and ringfinger. Thus, a survey on dermatoglyphic pattern can be useful in early detection of persons who are susceptible to myocardial infarction particularly without risk factors of MI.

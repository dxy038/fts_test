Gastric perforation with massive hematemasis is a relatively rare clinical finding in newborn infants. In this article, with the objective to review risk factors for acute gastric perforation and massive hematemasis, we report a near-term neonate with massive hematemasis and gastric perforation following weaning from ventilator. The risk factors for hemorrhage and perforation in this neonate may be fetal distress, hypoxemia, indomethacin for PAD, aminophyline and dexamethason to expedite and frequent insertion of OG tube during the treatment.
A conclusion drawn from this report shows that in order to prevent this complication, as far as possible the occurence and cumulation of risk factors initiating gastric perforation and hematemasis in neonate admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit should be avoided.

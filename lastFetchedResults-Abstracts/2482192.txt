Objective: Although treatments with demonstrated efficacy exist for Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD);
researches on the effectiveness of combined treatment versus psychotherapy or drug treatment are controversial.
The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of Metacognitive therapy (MCT), fluvoxamine and the
combination of MCT with fluvoxamine treatment in treating patients with OCD.
Methods: Twenty-one outpatients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD without any other axis I and II
disorder were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions for 10 weeks of treatment: MCT,
fluvoxamine, and combined treatment group. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS), Beck
depression inventory-II-second edition (BDI-II), and Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) were administered at pretreatment
and post-treatment. Group differences were examined using chi-square (for gender and marital status),
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVAs) and one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVAs) statistical procedures
on each of the outcome measures using the SPSS-16 statistical package.
Results: Nineteen patients completed this study. All patients in MCT and combined treatment groups
showed significant improvement at post-treatment. ANCOVA results showed that MCT and combined treatment
lead to a more significant improvement in the severity of OCD symptoms (p < 0.001), depression (p < 0.001), and
anxiety (p < 0.001) than fluvoxamine treatment. There were no significant differences between MCT and
combined therapy (all p > 0.05).

This study measures the level of income inequality among the Iranian provinces by using objective (Gini,Theil and Herfindahl–Hirschman indices) and subjective (Dalton and Atkinson indices) indicators. The findings show that the per capita income is lower than the country average in 20 provinces, this is while Tehran's per capita income is 1.7 fold of the country average; 16 provinces have a per capita income lesser than 50 percent of Tehran's per capita income; the Sistan and Baluchestan's province per capita income is lower than 25 percent of Tehran's per capita income. Moreover the results gained the inequality indices imply that the highest inequality level has been in the years 2001 and 2003. Another important point is that the indices of Gini, Dalton and Atkinson have a similar ranking with high fluctuations while Theil and Herfindahl–Hirschman indices represent a different ranking with negligible fluctuations.

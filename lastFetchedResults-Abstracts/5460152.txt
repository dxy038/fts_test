The current standard approach to screening and diagnosing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) includes Pap smear triage followed by colposcopy. While it is effective, colposcopy is subjective, includes painful procedures such as biopsies and endocervical curettage, requires specialized training and involves a waiting period of several days for histopathologic reports. We are developing an alternate method of detecting and localizing cervical pre-cancerous lesions, known as hyperspectral diagnostic imaging (HSDI), in which the surface of the cervix is scanned with ultraviolet and white light. Fluorescent and reflected light patterns generated by the cervical tissue are collected and analyzed by the spectrometer to determine features which discriminate among the various stages of CIN. The HSDI approach is objective, painless, requires minimal training and provides immediate results

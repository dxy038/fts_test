This work proposes a model to estimate the electromagnetic (EM) power coupling between an EM probe and an embedded cryptosystem. All the assumptions and the approximations of this approach are introduced and discussed to extract a general model to be applied to a multi-layer circuit. The power coupled to each circuit layer can thus be estimated by using this model. In particular, an example of power coupling with a real circuit is provided. The long term objective is the development of a macro-model able to predict the effects of an EM pulse on a cryptosystem knowing the energy delivered by an EM probe.

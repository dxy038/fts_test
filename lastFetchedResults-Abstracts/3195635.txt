Inertially stabilized platforms are subject of interest to different engineering areas, such as telecommunications, robotics and military systems. The objective is to maintain the attitude of a desired object constant despite the movements of a host vehicle, in order to point towards a chosen direction. This paper deals with the platform stabilization problem in the case where only two gyroscopic sensors are available. In this case, certain restrictions to vehicle dynamics are considered. Sensor positioning and sensitivity analysis to unmodeled motion are also discussed. An extension to the visual tracking problem is presented using a class of algorithms for fast digital image registration.

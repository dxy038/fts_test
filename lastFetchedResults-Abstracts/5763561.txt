The detailed validation of reactive systems, using an extension of VDM, is studied. The specification and proof of behavioural aspects is added to VDM by using traces of the input/output activities. The major objective of the work is to progress in the comprehension of the practical implications of the specification, design, and symbolic validation of machine-checked reactive systems

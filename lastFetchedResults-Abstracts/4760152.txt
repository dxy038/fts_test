We introduce a novel sequence and topology encoding for multicast protocol (STMP) in a wireless ad hoc network equipped with GPS unit in every node. The mobile nodes with GPS receivers can get the measures from GPS unit; accordingly each node updates its local snapshot of the network topology. Our objective is to find a multicast routing mechanism can reduce the number of packet forwarding and improve the efficiency of ad hoc network routing scheme in such a dynamical environment. The resulting multicast tree based on the mechanism is then encoded by using sequence and topology encoding with two integer sequences which we can determine four statuses of each node to transmit packets efficiently. In our simulations, shows that the overhead can reduce up to 40% compared with the original overhead of OLAM. Furthermore, STMP is more efficient with the increase of the size of multicast group.

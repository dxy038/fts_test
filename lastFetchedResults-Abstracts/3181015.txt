In order to make a decision about a region´s current warning status of Citrus bacteria canker disease so as to guide farmers to take several effective measures to prevent and control it, a web-based automatic warning system for Citrus bacteria canker disease using AHP is proposed in this paper. For current factors which could cause Citrus bacteria canker disease are diversity, dynamic, real-time changes and etc. we use AHP methodology to take different factors into consideration and change the factors and their impacts whenever needed. Once each factor´s weight is calculated, combing with a region´s actual situation about these factors, we can obtain the region´s current warning status by multiplication. Thus we can take several corresponding measures to prevent and control it. The application of this system shows that the design of the proposed multi-factor automatic warning system for citrus bacteria canker disease has been validated and we can get each factor´s weight easily by using AHP. The system could help user to make objective judgments on subjective descriptions and get the correct result about a region´s current warning status finally.

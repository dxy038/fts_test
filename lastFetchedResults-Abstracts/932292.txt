The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of autochthonous selected starter cultures on the growth and development of fortuitous flora and food pathogens for the production of two traditional dry-fermented products, salchichón and chorizo, in two different ripening processes. Three strains of Pediococcus acidilactici (MC184, MS198 and MS200) and one of Staphylococcus vitulus (RS34) which possess desirable technological properties were associated to prepare three starter cultures: P184S34, P198S34 and P200S34. Then salchichón and chorizo were prepared following two different manufacturing procedures. The use of these starter cultures decreased the “spontaneous” flora growing in the traditional fermented products and constituted an additional improvement to the microbial safety by reducing Enterobacteriaceae proliferation at the beginning of the ripening process. An effect against food-borne pathogens was also observed. Hence the three inoculated autochthonous starter cultures can be used as protective agents.

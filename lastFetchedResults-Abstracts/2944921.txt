The objective of this paper is to describe the development of laboratories for a new manufacturing oriented interdisciplinary baccalaureate degree program in electromechanical engineering technology (BSEMET) implemented at Penn State Altoona in Fall 1995. The BSEMET program has developed out of a growing demand from small to medium sized U.S. manufacturing organizations for technical workforce with a wide range of skills for solving problems simultaneously involving technologies related to manufacturing, data communications, instrumentation, and computer technologies used in todayÂ´s industrial settings. New innovative laboratories have been developed to support the courses to be taught in the manufacturing oriented interdisciplinary BSEMET curriculum. This paper begins with a description of the background of newly developed BSEMET curriculum. The goals and objectives of this program are listed. Next there is a description of the objectives, organization, and equipment used in the new laboratories developed in support of the courses taught in the above mentioned interdisciplinary program

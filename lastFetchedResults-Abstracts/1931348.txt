The objective of this work was to study the effect of small doses of naloxone (Nx) on the pulsatile secretion of prolactin (Pr). For this purpose 12 crossbreed ewes were selected and allocated to three groups of four. Group 1 was treated with two injections (at 7 and 19 h) of 40 Î¼g of GnRH. Group 2 was treated with two i.m. injections (at 7 and 19 h) of 0.5 mg of naloxone. And the control group 3 was sham treated with injections of 3 ml saline. Blood samples were taken at 20 min intervals during six consecutive hours after injections. When ewes were treated at 7 h no significant changes were observed in concentrations of prolactin following treatment with GnRH. Values fluctuated between 200 and 210 ng/ml. In group 2 treated with naloxone there was no change in plasma Pr concentrations during the first 100 min of sampling, however 60 min after Nx treatment Pr decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) and thereafter Pr plasma levels were consistently less (p &lt; 0.001) than control and GnRH treated ewes for the duration of the experiment. The response of the three groups after the second injection (19 h): After the injection of GnRH plasma Pr levels followed much the same pattern observed after the initial treatment, Pr concentrations were similar to those of control ewes. Ewes treated with a second small dose of naloxone (0.5 mg i.m.) however, showed a decrease in plasma Pr 60 min after the administration of the endogenous opioid antagonist. Thereafter Nx treated ewes had lesser (p &lt; 0.001) plasma Pr levels until the termination of the experiment. It was concluded that Nx an opioid antagonist administered in small intermittent doses can alter Pr plasma concentrations in the ewe, showing that endogenous opioids are important modulators of endocrine function and that the administration of small intermittent doses of opioid antagonists produce significant endocrine changes in ewes.

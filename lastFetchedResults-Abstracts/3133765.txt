The overall objective of BONSAI project (FP6, EC) is the development of ultrasensitive bio-imaging techniques based on novel multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) with tailored optical and magnetic properties for visualizing complex cellular structures (in tissues and organs), receptors, tumour cells and masses. An important aspect to take into consideration involves the cellular responses to the impact of exogenous structures represented by NPs themselves. As a preliminary sign of reaction, we start to investigate the basic cytotoxicity.

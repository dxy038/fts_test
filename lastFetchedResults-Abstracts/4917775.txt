Based on PSO algorithm and geometric implication of the reliability index, a global optimal method is put forward to calculate the reliability index. In recently years, multi-pile composite foundation is widely used. The classification and the computation methods of bearing capacity of multi-pile composite ground are generalized, and the ultimate bearing capacity equation is deduced in this paper. The PSO algorithm is used in reliability analysis of multi-pile composite foundation. The program of computing reliability index is developed in MATLAB. Three practical examples using Monte-Carlo method and PSO algorithm show that PSO algorithm has the advantages of rapid convergence and high perecision in the reliability analysis of bearing capacity of multi-pile composite ground.

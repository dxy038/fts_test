We performed a study of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in a series of 22 renal tumors. In 11 cases, molecular results could be compared with those of cytogenetic studies. The highest frequency of allelic losses at 3p was seen in clear cell nonpapillary renal tumors, whereas none of the papillary renal cell carcinomas showed LOH at 3p. Allelic losses on 3p were found to be independent of tumor grade or stage or both. One case analyzed showed a discrepancy between cytogenetic and LOH studies. This tumor displayed rearrangements of chromosome 3 and no LOH at the c-RAF-1 (close to the Von Hippel Lindau gene) locus.

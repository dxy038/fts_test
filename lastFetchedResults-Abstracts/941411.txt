This work is based on simultaneous measurements of direct solar radiation along with other chemical measurements, with the
objective of investigating the diurnal and seasonal variations of atmospheric turbidity factors (i.e., Linke's factor, Ångström's
coefficient, and aerosol optical depth). Relationships between atmospheric turbidity factors, expressing the solar radiation
extinction, and anthropogenic air pollutants were also evaluated. The frequency of occurrence of the individual indices has been
established to describe the sky conditions. The preliminary results obtained indicate high variability of aerosol loading, leading to
high turbidity for most of the year. Annual averages of 0.2 and 6 with standard deviations of 0.096 and 0.98 were found for
Ångström and Linke turbidities, respectively. On the base of the frequency of occurrence, it has been found that over 50% of the
dataset are around 0.25 and 6.3 for Ångström and Linke turbidities, respectively. On average, the month of September experienced
the highest turbidity, while December experienced the lowest. A possible reason for this is that the vertical distribution of the
aerosol particles moves up in September due to the extent of the Sudan monsoon trough. We also note that spring values of the
turbidity factors are closer to summer values, whereas the pronounced difference between the summer values in comparison with
the winter values may be attributed to relatively greater difference in the water vapor level in the atmosphere.

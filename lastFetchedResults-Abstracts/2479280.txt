Background and Objective: Due to susceptible pupil population to airborne diseases, it is important that monitoring of indoor and ambient air quality in schools. The number of bioaerosols is related to spreading diseases in pupils that spend 6 hours in schools. The aim of this research is to determine type and number of bioaerosols in indoor and ambient air in schools, geographical situation and season effects on number of bioaerosols.
Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study is carried out in Adalat and Payam ghoran girl high schools in Slamshahr in a period of 22/10/2013 to 21/5/2014. The air sampling for assessing of bioaerosols number in indoor and ambient air is carried out by microbial air direct sampler (Quick Take-30) at 28.3 L/min flow rate. The results are compared with European Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice (EU GMP) standard and specified pollution level of station.
Results: The mean bacterial and fungal number of indoor air is higher than ambient air in classes. Also, the mean airborne bacterial and fungal number in the second floor is the most. The presence of Aspergillus and Penicillum is tangible both of environments.
Conclusion: The findings indicate that higher bioaerosols number in class with higher pupils number may be resulted in respiratory disorders and aeroallergen acute symptoms in long term.

The nonlinear dynamic response of laminated basalt composite plates has been investigated under dynamic loads. The geometric nonlinearity effects are taken into account with the von Kármán large deflection theory of thin plates. All edges simply supported boundary conditions are considered. The equations of motion for the plate are derived by the use of the virtual work principle. Approximate solutions are assumed for the space domain and substituted into the equations of motion. Then the Galerkin Method is used to obtain the nonlinear differential equations in the time domain. The finite difference and Newmark methods are applied to solve the system of coupled nonlinear equations. The effects of different loading conditions on the laminated basalt composites have been investigated. A parametric study is conducted considering the effects of aspect ratio, fiber orientation, peak pressure values, thickness, and waveform parameter. The objective is to show that, the laminated basalt composites would be a good alternative for structures under dynamic loads.

Fetal Electrocardiogram has considerable diagnostic significance, and application of FECG monitoring are diverse and in wide use. Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) signal contains potentially precise information that could assist clinicians in making more appropriate and timely decisions during labor. For diagnostic-quality FECG recordings, signal acquisition must be noise free. The signal acquisition is susceptible to the interference from other biological and environmental sources. The purpose of this review paper is to illustrate the various methodologies and developed algorithms on FECG signal detection and analysis to provide efficient and effective ways for the detection of the QRS complexes of the fetus cardiac activity using multi-channel maternal ECG recordings .The main objective is to analyze the Signal with Noise .Removing of baseline wander can cause distortion of important clinical information, particularly ST-segment distortion. The goal was minimal distortion of the original signal micro-potential waveform, combined with maximum noise reduction and preservation of the entire signal components correlated with the QRS complex.

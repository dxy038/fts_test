The objective of the blending is to improve the performance of diesel fuel by improving its calorific value by blending of non conventional additive (NCA). Global air pollution is a serious threat caused by excessive use of fossil fuels for transportation. Despite the fact that diesel fuel is a big environmental pollutant as it contains different hydrocarbons, sulphur and crude oil residues, it is yet regarded as a highly critical fuel due to its wide applications. Now a dayÂ´s non conventional additive is blended with diesel fuel to achieve numerous advantages such as improvement Calorific Value (CV) and lowering CO<sub>2</sub>, and CO emissions as well as higher lubricity. Non conventional additive (NCA) is an ideal material for energy recovery as it holds high energy value. In this study, various percentages of NCA is blended with diesel were tested to evaluate the fuel properties. The results of the variance analysis revealed that the addition of the additive improved diesel fuel performance by increasing in calorific value thus improvement in specific fuel consumption.

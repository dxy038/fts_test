Introduction: Bite plane is an important devices for diagnosing and treating the patient with T.M.J dysfunctions.
Objective: The aim of this research is to study its effects on EMG activity of mastication muscles. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients with TMJ dysfunctions were selected. EMG of masseter and temporal muscles (left and right) was recorded with surface electrode. Then, the subjects were freated by the bite plane. The wave were taken in both muscles in three positions, include rest position (r), maximum intercuspation position (co) and maximum clenching (cl). Bite plane was made for all patients from cold cure acrylic resin.
Before the use of bite plane, E.M.G was gotten two sides of mastication muscles then it was used for 3 months only at nights and after that E.M.G will be repeated and then they compare to each other with analysis of pair-t-test.
Results: The mean activity of masster and temporal muscles decrease in the left and right side of patient after use of bite plane (P<0.05). The mean duration masster muscle didn't have significant difference after treatment.
Conclusion: Bite plane in patients with T.M.J disorders cause to decreases activity of contraction of mastication muscless it may beore importance of temporal muscles in position of mandibular joints. But, the masster muscle is less affected by bite plane.

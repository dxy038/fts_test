This paper reviews the state of knowledge on flame acceleration and deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in smooth ducts and ducts equipped with turbulence-producing obstacles. The objective is to bring to light the basic understanding of the phenomenon and its application to explosion safety. The scope of the review is restricted to homogeneous gas-phase combustion with emphasis placed on experimental investigation.

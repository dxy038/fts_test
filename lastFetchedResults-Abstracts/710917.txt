Abstract
Study Objective
To assess the degree to which adolescents/young adults are satisfied in their current sexual relationships and to evaluate intrapersonal and interpersonal predictors of sexual satisfaction among that population.
Design
Cross-sectional analysis.
Setting
Participants were recruited from an adolescent medicine clinic and a college in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Participants
A total of 313 sexually experienced adolescent/young adults ranging in age from 14 to 24 participated. Fifty percent were white and 60% female.
Methods
Participants completed a questionnaire about their demographics, romantic relationships, mental health, sexual history/behavior, and sexual satisfaction. Univariate logistic regression models were conducted to determine the relationship between each predictor and satisfaction with their current sexual relationship. To identify the most important predictors of sexual satisfaction, a final multiple logistic regression model was created using backward elimination.
Results
Approximately 85% of adolescents/young adults in the present study reported feeling satisfied in their current sexual relationships. Those who were in an overall positive relationship, who were less sensitive emotionally within interpersonal relationships, and who had more frequent sex, fewer lifetime sexual partners, and more condom-protected sex were more likely to be satisfied with the current sexual relationship.
Conclusions
Sexuality develops within the context of both intrapersonal and interpersonal factors. Thus, researchers should incorporate a multi-factorial approach when designing studies on adolescent sexuality.

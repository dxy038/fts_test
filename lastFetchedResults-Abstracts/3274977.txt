Visual servoing is a useful approach for robot control. It is specially attractive when the control objective can be stated directly in image coordinates like in point-to-point regulation. The adaptive control is a technique very used in robot manipulators due to uncertainty in the dynamic model and when is combined with vision allows to handle uncertainty in the camera parameters. In this paper, we propose an adaptive control for a robot manipulator, which allows the displacement of the end-effector following a reference trajectory. It is assumed that the robot is planar and the camera fixed, so that the image plane is parallel to the manipulator workspace. Two well-known adaptive schemes have been simulated together with the proposed algorithm to compare the performance of the different approaches. Simulation results show the good performance of the complete system.

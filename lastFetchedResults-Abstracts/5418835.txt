Several organizations in Europe are participating in the ITALSAT propagation experiment (Paraboni et al. 1992, and J.M. Woodroffe et al. 1993). In Spain, propagation measurements using the ITALSAT 50 GHz signal are being carried out at Yebes (located 80 Km from Madrid). The receiver employed is a radiotelescope with a 14 m antenna. Since the radiotelescope is used mainly for radioastronomy observations, it is available for propagation measurements several days per month. Therefore, long term statistics will not be obtained. The main objective of the experiment is to investigate the effects of atmospheric phenomena on the 50 GHz received signal. Single events and short term signal variations (due to clouds, rain, scintillation,etc.) are studied relating them to concurrent meteorological measurements. The initial activities are directed towards characterizing the receiver for the propagation measurements. The narrow beamwidth of the antenna is the most significant peculiarity, which makes accurate tracking a critical requirement

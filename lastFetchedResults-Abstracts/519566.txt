Data mining has been used by researchers and key organizations for variety of purpose to improve the business intelligence processes. The research paper explains the use of data mining to promote selling of luxury goods with in e-retailing value chain in order to facilitate process of data analysis and decision making. We have analyzed how launching a product in e-retail domain requires sufficient detailed results taken from effective data mining technique. In order to determine the regions with closed and heavily populated wealth clusters, clustering technique was applied. To achieve the desired objective first we have obtained the database of most affluent people across the globe and further applied clustering and data visualization technique to do some predictive analysis which can further help in focusing product marketing in e-retailing. The result achieved describes region fragmentation on basis of wealth and accordingly the e-retail concept can be implemented for those specific regions. This paper illustrates cutting edge advantages of product selling through e-retail and the challenges encountered to implement data mining to achieve the desired objective.

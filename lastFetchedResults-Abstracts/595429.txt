Objective: To evaluate the effictiveness and safety of long pulsed Nd: YAG laser in hirsutism. Material and Methods: Fifty adult patients (skin phototypes II-V) with dark terminal facial hair and normal hormonal profile were treated with a long-pulsed Nd: YAG laser (1064 nm 10-mm spot size, fluence of 30 to 50 J/cnf). Four consecutive laser treatments were delivered to all the patients at 4- to 6-week intervals. Photographic evaluations and hair count of skin sites were obtained at baseline, immediately, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the final laser treatment. Results: Maximum hair reduction was observed after the first treatment in all the patients. All the patients completed the study. The maximum hair reduction was observed after first treatment 73%, after 3 months the hair reduction was 70%, whereas the response to treatment was 65% at the end of six months after the treatment. Conclusion: Long pulsed Nd YAG laser is a safe and effective method for hair reduction in all skin types involving the face.

The notion of strict minimum of order m for real optimization problems is
extended to vector optimization. Its properties and characterization are studied in
the case of finite-dimensional spacesŽmultiobjective problems.. Also the notion of
super-strict efficiency is introduced for multiobjective problems, and it is proved
that, in the scalar case, all of them coincide. Necessary conditions for strict
minimality and for super-strict minimality of order m are provided for multiobjective
problems with an arbitrary feasible set. When the objective function is Fr´echet
differentiable, necessary and sufficient conditions are established for the case
m 1, resulting in the situation that the strict efficiency and super-strict efficiency
notions coincide

This review discusses recent progress in the application of one of the most effective in-line preconcentration techniques used in electrophoresis in capillaries and microchips, electrokinetic supercharging (EKS). Conventionally considered as a transient isotachophoresis (tITP) step put into effect after the electrokinetic sample injection (EKI), EKS presumes that the electrolyte filled into the capillary (or microchip channel) comprises a co-ion acting as a leading ion to stack the injected analytes. Subsequently, to create the tITP state, one needs an additional injection of a suitable terminating ion. As a resulting increase in sensitivity strongly depends on the performance of both EKS stages, two theoretical sections are focused on hints for proper arrangement of EKI and tITP elaborated by means of computer simulation. In particular, factors affecting the injected amount of analytes, different modes of introducing the sample, suitable combinations of leading and terminating ions, and optimization of supporting electrolyte compositions are discussed with an objective to increase the enrichment factors. A comprehensive coverage of recent EKS applications in capillary and microchip electrophoresis, including metal ions, pharmaceuticals, peptides, DNA fragments, and proteins, demonstrates attainable sensitivity enhancements up to two orders of magnitude. This should make this method exportable to other analytes and facilitate its more widespread use to applications that require low limits of detection.

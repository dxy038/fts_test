Objective:  Gallium and indium-containing alloys have demonstrated an ability to wet and bond to many types of materials including enamel. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the bond strengths of a gallium-and-indium-containing alloy and a dental amalgam to human enamel surfaces.

Method: A flat enamel bonding surface was created by slicing recently extracted human molars with a 180-grit diamond wheel. Cylinders of amalgam or a gallium–indium alloy were bonded to the as-cut surfaces or to as-cut surfaces that had been pumiced, air-abraded or acid-etched for various times. Before testing, samples were stored under different conditions (100% humidity, immersed in water, thermocycled). The shear-bond strength was determined using a crosshead speed of 0.1 mm min−1. Sample size was 10. Data was subjected to ANOVA and a post-hoc Tukey's test.

Results: The bond strength of amalgam to enamel was zero. The bond strength of the gallium–indium alloy ranged between 6.5 MPa (10 s etch with 10% phosphoric acid) and 4.2 MPa (pumiced enamel). Acid-etching significantly increased the bond strength (P>0.0001) The bond strength was not significantly affected by the type of mechanical surface preparation, storage conditions, thermocycling, etching times or acid concentrations.

Significance: Bonding, particularly chemical bonding, suggests a greater potential for better wetting and therefore better sealing of a cavity. Since microleakage of restorations is one of the principal causes of restoration failure, materials that can bond may in turn posses enhanced resistance to microleakage and ultimately, resistance to restoration failure. The gallium–indium alloy evaluated in this study may be such an alloy.

In this paper, we propose a decentralized VPLs based control policy for semiconductor manufacturing. Based on utilizations and entropies, a new classification method is designed to decentralize global objectives into local objectives of workstations. Then a decentralized multi-objective scheduling policy is proposed to control Virtual Production Lines (VPLs). We generate two SMS cases from a test bed in order to evaluate multiple performances of the proposed policy. Experimental results validate the effectiveness in solving multi-objective scheduling problems for the semiconductor manufacturing system.

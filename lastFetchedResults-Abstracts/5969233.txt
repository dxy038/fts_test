The scientific and reasonable choice of transportation route is the essential condition that safeguards the hazardous material transportation security. Aiming at hazardous material highway transportation network, this paper puts forward the definition of safety-unblocked synthetic value and hazardous blocked synthetic value at first. Then this paper turns the hazardous material highway transportation route decision-making problem into a single objective shortest path problem and applies the A-star algorithm to solve it. Finally, this paper proves the feasibility of the decision-making method with an example. This decision-making method is helpful for the government monitoring department and the transportation enterprise choose the reasonable transportation route.

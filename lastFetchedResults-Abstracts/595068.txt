Objective: To evaluate the faetal and maternal morbidity and mortality associated with obstructed labour.Material and Methods: A prospective study of outcome of obstructed labour was conducted in Gynae "A" Unit of Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, over a period of two years extending from 1st December 1996 to 1st December 1998.Results: 6280 deliveries were conducted during this period and 284 cases of obstructed labour were found constituting an incidence of 4.52%. 94.8% patients came in emergency and 5.2% were booked patients. The most common cause of obstructed labour was cephalo-pelvic disproportion (47.5%) followed by fetal malposition and malpresentation (45.5%). The majority of these patients were between 25-29 years of age and primigravida. Caesarean section was the most common mode of delivery. Maternal morbidity due to different complications accounted for 84.1% of the cases while fetal morbidity occurred in 47.8% of the cases. The maternal mortality in this series was 1% and perinatal mortality 38%.Conclusion: In our study the incidence of obstructed labour is very high. Improving the access to and promoting the use of reproductive and contraceptive services will help reduce the prevelance of this complication.

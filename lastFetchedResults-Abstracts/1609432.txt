Biodiesel is biodegradable, non-toxic and has the capacity for sustainable development, energy conservation and environmental preservation. Apart from yielding high value latex, the rubber plant supply large amount of rubber seed, which are currently underutilized. Extracting biodiesel from rubber seed is a viable option which demands attention for research to consolidate and optimize the process parameters. Design of experiments (DOE) is a powerful statistical approach which is used for optimizing the process parameters through two stage esterification process, relating acid and alkaline as catalyst. Reducing the acid value is the primary objective for process optimization in acid esterification process, whereas, maximizing the monoester yield is the objective for the alkaline-esterification process. Different saturated and unsaturated monoesters present in the biodiesel were quantified using gas chromatograph in order to determine the yield percentage, which ensures the quality of the biodiesel. The fuel was tested for properties such as viscosity, calorific value and carbon residue using standard test procedures and found to be analogous with diesel, which makes it possible to use this alternate fuel in the existing engine without any modification.

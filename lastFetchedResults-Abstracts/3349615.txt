The objective of this paper is to propose a decentralized control for a class of large scale uncertain systems. These systems consist of interconnected subsystems where the nonlinear interconnections are quadratic bounded. The proposed control is based on a new form of dynamic observer (DO) and the popular used proportional observer (PO) and proportional integral observer (PIO) are only particular cases of it. The control method is derived from the solution of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), on the basis of the algebraic constraints obtained from the analysis of estimation error. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

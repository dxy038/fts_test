ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer is the most common form of malignancy among men. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is used to screen for prostate cancer and may vary depending on different factors, such as age. This study aimed to investigate the cut-off value for PSA in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with prostate biopsy diagnosis undergoing transrectal ultrasound during 2011-2014. Data collection was performed using prepared checklists.
FINDINGS: In total, 422 patients were enrolled in this study, 180 of whom (42.7%) were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, and 242 (57.3%) had benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Mean age of the patients was 63.03±9.62 years, and the mean PSA was 27.95±64.44 ng/ml. The mean of PSA in patients over 51 years was 28.66±65.51 ng/ml, which was significantly higher than the values of the patients under 50 years of age (p=0.005).
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, the risk of prostate cancer was higher in the men within the age range of 60-80 years. In addition, patients with PSA levels of 10-20 ng/mL need to be fully screened for prostate cancer.

This study is a survey research. The population of the study was all specialists who have enough data about ways of sustainability rice cultivars that they were identified and studied through Non-probability sampling (purposeful and snowball). To determine the validity of the questionnaire, face and content validity was used, and, to assess the reliability, inconsistency coefficient was used. In order to achieve the main objective the technique of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used. The Expert Choice (EC) 2000 software was used to analyze the data. The application requirement of Analytic Hierarchy Process technique is considering the criteria sustainability of rice cultivation system, on the one hand, and decision alternatives (rice cultivars) on the other hand. Research findings showed that the cultivar of Hashemi is the most suitable cultivar for ecological sustainability of rice cultivation system.

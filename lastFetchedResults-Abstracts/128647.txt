Objective(s): To identify what barriers prevent clients from asking pharmacists their questions.
Methods: 200 pharmacy clients participated in the study. Each client completed a questioner with some demographic and main questions about the barriers that prevent clients from asking pharmacists their questions. To achieve study objectives 370 community pharmacies also were asked to participate in the study and fill in the similar questionnaire. Data were analyzed performing basic descriptive statistics.
Results: Only 20% believed pharmacists were prepared to provide appropriate patient consultation for prescription. Client reported barriers such as the pharmacist being too busy, standing behind and lack of privacy. The other barriers to asking pharmacist questions were client embarrassment and ignorance. Conclusion: In conclusion, pharmacists have an important opportunity to respond to clients' informational needs if the barriers could be reduced.

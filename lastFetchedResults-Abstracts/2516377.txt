Background and Objectives: Neck pain, specially non specific chronic neck pain (NSCNP) is one of the most common, disabling and costly musculoskeletal disorder. The most common treatments for this dysfunction are physical therapy or controlled immobilization with cervical collar, but the rational for must treatment approach based on clinical experiences more than scientific researches.Evidence shown that due to repeated movement or/and sustained posture overloading apply on some structural element that can lead to pain and disability  The objective of  this study was to the effect of soft collar on pain intensity and level of disability in people with NSCNP.
Subjects and Methods: In this longitudinal study design 16 subjects with NSCNP having the inclusion criteria were participated. Collar was applied for two weeks for all participants.Collar limited flexion, extension and lateral bending completely and permitted 30? rotation to both sides. Changes of pain and disability level were measured by Persian version of Neck Pain and Disability Scales and Neck Disability Index questionnairs before using, one week and two weeks after use of collar. The collected data was analyzed by SPSS-16, K-S and Repeated Measurment ANOVA tests.
Results: The level of pain and disability at all the three stages of measurement were significantly reduced (P < 0/001). Pain and disability moderately correlated together at all stages of measurement.  
Conclusions: Based on MSI and ICF models onset of mechanical dysfunctions are probably due to overloading to do so, unloading can improve signs or/and symptoms of patients. Results of this research emphasis that unloading mechanism of collar can improve both pain and disability level of people with NSCNP.

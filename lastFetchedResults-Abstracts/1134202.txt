Abstract
Introduction: Regarding to chronic nature of epilepsy, side effects and resistance to chemical drugs, herbal medicine have received remarkable interest. Matricaria chamomilla is a medicinal plant that has been used as tranquilizer and anticonvulsant in traditional medicine.
Objective: To determine the anticonvulsant effects of hydro-alcoholic extract of Matricaria chamomilla on PTZ-induced seizure in male rats. 
Materials and Methods: This experimental study was carried out on 48 NMRI albino male rats weighing 20-25g. They were divided randomly into six groups. All groups were injected intraperitoneally. The negative and positive control groups received saline (10 ml/1000g) and Phenobarbital (40 mg/kg), respectively. The four test groups received 500, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg of extract. In order to provoke convulsion, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was injected (80 mg/kg) to all groups after 45 minutes and initiation time of tonic-clonic seizures and mortality within 24 h were measured. 
Results: The results indicated that positive control group animals, which received Phenobarbital, were with no seizure and death. Different doses of extract delayed the initiation time of tonic-clonic seizures, in comparison with control group (saline). The delay was significant at 600 mg/kg (P <  0.05) and 800 and 1000 mg/kg (P <  0.001). Also, the extract decreased the 24 h death. This was significant at 800 and 1000 mg/kg (P < 0. 01) and 600 mg/kg (P <  0.05).
Conclusion: The present study showed that hydro-alcoholic extract of Matricaria chamomilla has inhibitive effect on PTZ-induced seizure in male rats.

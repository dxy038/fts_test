Blood bank has a major task to collect blood from donors, monitor blood quality and supply, and distribute blood and blood components to hospitals within the network. Blood distribution is an important activity within this blood supply chain. If the blood bank is able to deliver blood supply to its respective demand in a timely manner, patientsÂ´ lives will be saved. Nowadays, many regional blood banks in Thailand confront with ineffective communication channel and insufficient information to fulfill its obligation. Thus, this leads to an inaccurate blood distribution and a waste of time, which can be harmful to patients with critical conditions. It is our goal to develop a web-based system to manage blood requisition within the blood supply chain. The system was designed to cope with this problem. The main objective is to improve the efficiency of data communication within the supply chain to reduce response time for each blood demand request. We also focused on managing blood inventory at each blood bank effectively. The results have shown that the proposed system helps enhancing the communication among blood partners within the supply chain network. The blood bank staffs are able to fulfill blood demand request in a timely manner.

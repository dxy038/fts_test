A number of nonlinear optimization-based multiple-objective management models for sustainable utilization of coastal aquifers are formulated and solved. The management objectives represent plausible scenarios for planned withdrawal and salinity control in coastal aquifers. The first multiple-objective management model is developed for spatial and temporal control of aquifer salinity through planned pumping (withdrawal) from locations closest to the ocean boundary. The second multiple-objective management model is useful for maximizing sustainable water withdrawal from the aquifer for beneficial uses, while limiting the maximum salinity in the aquifer. The third multiple-objective management model is developed for maximizing sustainable water withdrawal from the aquifer for beneficial uses and minimizing the total pumping at locations adjacent to the ocean boundary to control the salinity in the aquifer. The nonlinear finite-difference form of the steady-state density-dependent miscible flow and salt transport model for seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers is embedded within the constraints of the management model. The constraint method of generating noninferior solutions is used to solve the multiple-objective management problems. The management models are solved for a hypothetical unconfined coastal aquifer system. The projected augmented Lagrangian method of nonlinear programming is used to solve the resulting large-scale optimization problem. The solution results demonstrate the feasibility of the developed optimization models and also the conflicting nature of the various objectives of coastal aquifer management.

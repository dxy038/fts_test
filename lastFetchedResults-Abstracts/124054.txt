Objective(s): To study of the effects of women reproductive factors on heel QUS parameters and comparison of it with BMD of femoral neck in normal women of Tehran.
Methods: In 151 normal women, 20 - 72Y/O (participant of IMOS (Iranian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study), BMD(DXA) of femoral neck and QUS of heel (using Achilles+) was assessed. After assessment of normal values, Stiffness Index (SI) percentiles (2.5, 50, 97.5) in them established.
Results: Mean values of BMD, SOS, BUA and SI, was 0.908±13.7,36/75± 1527/25, 121142 ± 15/1, 94/46 ± 17/92, respectively. BMD and QUS parameters showed a significant decrease with age (P<0.01) and their relation with years since menopause was significant. Relation of gravity and parity and lactation with QUS parameters was significant but there was no such relation among BMD of femoral neck and gravity and parity. Its relation with lactation was weak.
Conclusion: Results of this study shows more stronger effect of main reproductive factors on QUS parameters of heel than BMD of femoral neck measured with DXA method.

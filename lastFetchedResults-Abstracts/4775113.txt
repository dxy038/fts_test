Everything in this world has been generated and invented for the easy living of human being like things such as electricity, fuels, etc. This paper concentrates on electricity from renewable energy systems like solar and wind energy. The objective of this paper is to propose a novel multilevel inverter using hybrid Photo Voltaic (PV)/Wind power system in order to simplify the power system and reduce harmonics and the cost effect. Multilevel inverter using combination of solar and wind was implemented by PWM modulation technique. This method of implementation can minimize the total harmonic distortion which is confirmed by MATLAB. The MATLAB is used to confirm the seven level output voltage of inverter. Simulation results have shown the performance of the proposed multilevel inverter with reduced harmonics.

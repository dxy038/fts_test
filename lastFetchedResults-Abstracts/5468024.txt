This paper presents three alternative maxium peak power tracking-based control algorithms with stall regulation for optimal wind energy capture: torque reference-based MPPT algorithm, searching-based MPPT algorithm and fuzzy-based MPPT algorithm. The first algorithm uses a torque reference as a guideline for tracking. The second method searches an optimal operating point from the slope of the power-rotational speed curve. The last one achieves the control objective using a developed fuzzy logic rule base. These three algorithms were implemented on a low cost digital signal controller board and tested with a real-time wind turbine simulator. It is found from the experiment that the three algorithms can manage to obtain the maximum power for any input wind speeds but with different control performance in terms of power fluctuation, rotational speed fluctuation and tracking time.

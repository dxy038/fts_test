We propose a new objective function for the image reconstruction problem, where the image is comprised of piecewise smooth regions separated by sharp boundaries. We use alternating minimization to minimize our objective function. We use the level set technique to minimize with regard to the boundary. The advantage of this new approach is shown through the bias/variance analysis of a hot spot

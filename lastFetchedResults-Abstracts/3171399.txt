In order to effectively solve the blending optimization problem in cement production process, an optimization model integrating production indices, the cost and its solution method are provided. Firstly, the cost and the rate values of raw materials are incorporated into the optimization model respectively as the objective function. Penalty function is used to transform optimization problem with constraints into an unconstrained problem. And then particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is applied to search the optimum ratios. When the optimization information of swarm becomes stagnant, the &#8220;inertia weight&#8221; operator, cross and mutation operations based on protection strategy are introduced in the optimization process that make the algorithm to maintain diversity and better convergence rates. The calculation result shows that the presented method can effectively improve the global search ability and convergence speed. The optimization result can improve the passing rate of indicators by reducing production cost and the harmful ingredient of the mixed material.

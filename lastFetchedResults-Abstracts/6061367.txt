The main objective of Electronic Engineering learning is the development of the studentÂ´s ability to design, simulate and test electronic circuits to implement real systems. Commercial tools are very flexible and feature a lot of options. Nevertheless, they are oriented towards the professional market, and they provide many features not needed for educational purposes. On the other hand, much time devoted to understanding very complex manuals is required by the students to master these tools, slowing down the learning of fundamental design concepts. The objective of this communication is to present a CAD tool for the design of digital electronic circuits as well as for testing developed circuits. The system, which is called VISCP, is an educational tool for practical training on Digital Systems and is intended to guide students in the practical design of basic digital circuits

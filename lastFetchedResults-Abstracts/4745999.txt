The objective of knowledge processing system is to promote knowledge integration, sharing and retrieval in distributed and heterogeneous environment. This paper puts forward an ontology-based model-OBKPM for knowledge processing, which promises better access to relevant knowledge by producing a global domain ontology that is used for establishing semantic connections among the local ontologies of autonomous knowledge sources as well as for retrieving those sources. In OBKPM, a bottom-up integration approach with two-stage mapping process is proposed to solve both the semantic heterogeneities and the query answering problems. In this approach, local ontologies and the global ontology are all treated in graph-based representation, and the overall integration and access process will be briefly illustrated through examples.

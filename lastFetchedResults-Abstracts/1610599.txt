This paper presents the feasibility study of a sound scientific, engineering, and technological solution for converting lignocellulosic biomass to electrical power using a trailer-scale downdraft biomass gasification system coupled with a spark-ignited IC engine/electric generator set for portable power applications on agricultural farms and in rural areas.

in objective of this study is to investigate the coupling and integration between the gasification unit and the power generation unit. Also it is intended to emphasize on the effectiveness of distributed power generation systems and demonstrate the feasibility of such integrated systems in real world scenarios, where the lignocellulosic biomass resources are widely available and distributed across the board. Four feedstock materials, pine, red oak, horse manure and cardboard that represent a wide spectrum of lignocellulosic biomass resources were chosen for the study. The efficiencies for individual components and the overall integrated system efficiencies were evaluated using experimental data and a thermalâ€“chemical model for all four feedstocks.

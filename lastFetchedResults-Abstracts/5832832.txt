The global exponential stability is analyzed for a class of uncertain neutral-type neural networks with multiple variable and distributed delays. By applying Jensen integral inequality, free-weighting matrix method and linear matrix inequality(LMI) techniques, some less conservative delay-dependent stability criteria are obtained, which generalize some previous results in the literature. Furthermore, the obtained results can be generalized to uncertain neural networks and bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks.

The production of corn masa-based products in the US has been increasing over the last several years, and as a result, so has the quantity of waste materials being generated from this industry. Although currently landfilled, these byproduct streams may have potential for value-added processing and utilization, which are options that simultaneously hold the promise of increased economic benefit for masa processors as well as decreased potential pollution for the environment. Fundamental to any byproduct development effort is knowledge of the characteristics of the residue stream, because physical and chemical properties are vital for the proper design of subsequent processing operations and applications. Data for masa byproduct materials are currently not readily available, however. Thus, the objective of this study was to fully investigate, review, and summarize the existing literature in order to develop a comprehensive knowledge base for these residue streams. The most substantial findings from this study were that masa residues currently are not being utilized as coproducts, but instead are being landfilled; they have a high fiber content, and thus much untapped potential exists for its extraction and value-added utilization vis-Ã -vis human and industrial applications, including phytosterol and ethanol production. It was also determined that masa byproducts, due to the high fiber content, may also be suitable for use as livestock feed additives, especially for ruminant animals that can digest these materials. Furthermore, due to substantial calcium content, masa byproducts could also potentially be used as a calcium resource. Under current processing practices, though, these residues have very high moisture contents. Before they can be effectively and economically utilized, they must be dehydrated in order to reduce transportation costs, decrease microbial activity, and increase shelf life.

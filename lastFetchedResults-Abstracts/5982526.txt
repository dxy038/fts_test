The power system is said to be in a state of congestion whenever the physical or operational constraints in a transmission network become active. In a deregulated environment, congestion in the transmission lines can be relieved by one of the two congestion management methodologies viz. cost free and non-cost free methods. In this paper, congestion is relieved by using cost free method and is reduced by employing static synchronous series compensator (SSSC). Genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques were used to obtain the global optimal solution as the objective function is nonlinear in congestion management and these techniques were tested on IEEE 30-bus system.

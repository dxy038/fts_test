A wavelet-domain image resolution enhancement algorithm which is based on the estimation of detail wavelet coefficients at high resolution scales is proposed. The method exploits wavelet coefficient correlation in a local neighbourhood sense and employs linear least-squares regression to estimate the unknown detail coefficients. Results show that the proposed method is considerably superior to conventional image interpolation techniques, both in objective and subjective terms, while it also compares favourably with competing methods operating in the wavelet domain.

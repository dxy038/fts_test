Abstract: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a managerial powerful tool for assess the performance of Decision Making Units (DMUs). Nowadays, multi-objective DEA models are an attractive technique for evaluation quantity and quality aspects of performance analysis. But these models are in static. In this paper, we want to present a proposed fuzzy dynamic multi-objective DEA model in which data are changing sequentially. In this paper is presented to compare with those obtained using the proposed model as we'll as original DEA models. Results reveal that the new model just needs to solve multiple objective programming once to calculate the efficiency achievement for all DMUs and they are indication for improvement discriminating power of classical DEA models.

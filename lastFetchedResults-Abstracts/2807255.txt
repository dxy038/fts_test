This paper proposes a security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) method for micro-grid containing wind power. By using wind power forecast data to divide the range of wind power fluctuation into multiple scenes, this method optimizes power output of traditional generation units and their spinning reserve. Besides, the proposed SCED method avoids loadshedding in micro-grid while the wind power is fluctuated by including the cost of multi-scene load-shedding risk into an objective function and rational curtailment of wind power. Reliability and stability of micro-grid are guaranteed while the total operation cost is minimized. Based on the practical data of a micro-grid, the numerical experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SCED method.

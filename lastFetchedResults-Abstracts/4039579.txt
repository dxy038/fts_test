This paper presents a preliminary investigation of orthogonal frequency coding (OFC) surface acoustic wave tags and sensors at a 500- and 900-MHz operational frequency range using conventional contact lithography techniques. The higher frequency devices are achieved using second harmonic operation; eliminating the need for advanced lithography techniques. The objective of this effort is to increase the technology readiness level of wideband OFC tags at higher frequencies. Measured device results are presented and compared with coupling of modes model predictions to demonstrate performance. The fundamental and harmonic device response is compared for devices designed for operation in the 900-MHz frequency band. The experimental correlation against an ideal matched filter is also presented.

In this paper, the problem of optimal DG planning with multi objectives under uncertainty is discussed. Unlike the traditional methods in which, minimization of cost was the only objective of planning problem, some other parameters which are important in decision making are taken into account. These uncertain factors are emission rate, renewable fraction, and fuel consumption. The AHP method is used to select the best plans based on their robustness, flexibility and risk exposure. A case study with the combinations of DGs with photo voltaic (PV), wind, natural gas and gasoline technologies is presented using the proposed method.

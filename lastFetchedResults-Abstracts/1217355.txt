Background and Objective: In different studies, the prevalence of postpartum depression has been reported as high as 5 to 25 %. This study was performed to determine the relationship between postpartum depression and methods of delivery.
Subjects and Methods: In this analytical study which was performed as co-groups, pregnant women who attended the Razi, Sina and Arvand hospitals in Ahwaz from 2010 through 2011 were enrolled. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was performed in the third trimester and in the last visit before delivery. Then cases were divided into three groups of 200 each: normal delivery, elective caesarean and emergent caesarean. The cases were reassessed once more 6 weeks after delivery.
Results: Mean age of cases, mean age of their husbands and families income were nearly were equal. There were no significant differences in frequency of pregnancy care, satisfaction of infant sexuality, vomiting and nausea in pregnancy. There was a significant difference among groups in incidence of postpartum depression (P=0.001): 9 cases (4.5 %) in normal delivery, 19 cases (9.2%) in elective caesarean and 34 cases (15.3%) in emergent caesarean.
Conclusions: Caesarean raises the incidence of postpartum depression especially when it is emergent.

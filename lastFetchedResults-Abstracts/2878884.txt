In order to meet the real-time optimal control requirements of a dual-mode power-split hybrid electric vehicle, a system predictive control strategy is studied in this paper. In order to deal with the contradiction between engine optimal fuel economy and the minimum range of battery SOC effectively, a control strategy used one dimensional search method for Multi-objective optimization control is proposed based on the analysis of structural characteristics of the power-split hybrid power system. This paper uses the improved fuel economy as the main target, the characteristic parameters of system in the future are predicted, and the speed and torque of the motor are adjusted with respect to the predictive results. An on-line optimization approach is applied to the real-time control, and the typical driving cycle is simulated by Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results show that the effects of the energy management strategy based on predictive control model are considerable, and this can realize the optimization of the engine operating point and improve the vehicleÂ´s fuel economy.

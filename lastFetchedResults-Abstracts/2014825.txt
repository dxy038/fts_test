The Northern San Jorge Gulf (NSJG) was designated Interjurisdictional Coastal Marine Park “Patagonia Austral” in 2008 with the objective of conserving biodiversity and natural resources. Metals released to the environment can be accumulated by organisms and can be toxic in some cases, making it necessary to evaluate their presence and biological risk. This study examined concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb in intertidal sediments of the NSJG, and was the first study of its kind to be conducted in this area. Concentrations of all metals fell below biological risk levels. Anthropogenic enrichment was only found for Ni around the Aristizábal lighthouse and was attributed to the frequent oil spills that impact this particular area.

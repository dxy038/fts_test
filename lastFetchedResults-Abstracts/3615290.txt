A laboratory system, transmitting 1 Gbit/s signals to a subscriber station and 565 Mbit/s signals back to a head station via one 20 km-long single-mode fibre, has been realised. Wavelength division multiplexing via two 3 dB fibre couplers of selectivity &#194;&#191;0.04 dB/nm has been used. The experiment demonstrates that bidirectional single-mode-fibre transmission is applicable to a future B-ISDN subscriber network.

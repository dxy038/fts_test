The latest generation of AC-fed traction drives, employing high-speed switching devices,
is able to control the reactive power drawn by each locomotive or train from the overhead line. If
the conditions at each train could be fed back to a central control point, it would be possible for a
centrally located controller to calculate optimal values for the reactive power in each drive and to
send these commands back to the individual equipments. A scheme is proposed whereby the AC
power flows are analysed in real time and the results used to optimise some particular system
objective via control of the PWM equipments as mobile reactive power compensators. The system
voltage profile can be improved and the overall power factor at the feeder substation made nearer
to unity. Computational verification is presented with results obtained from a multi-train simulator
with the power network optimisation operating in several test case scenarios. The test results are
compared with those obtained without compensation and with classical trackside Var
compensation methods. The scheme is shown to give the best improvement where an existing
fleet of diode or thyristor equipments is partially replaced with PWM front-end equipments. From
these results, the potential for PWM locomotives to improve overall system performance is clearly
confirmed.

It is well-known that channel throughput can be greatly enhanced by using a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system. To implement such a multiple-antenna structure in handset environments, conventional design approaches rely on fine tuning the geometric parameters of antenna layouts. In this paper, a completely different framework is implemented to develop the multiple antennas. Rather than tuning the geometric parameters, we discretize the design space into several pixels. Afterward, powerful multi-objective optimization algorithms may automatically find the best antenna topologies by varying the distribution of these pixels. Our preliminary results show that the impedance requirement of each antenna can be met, and the mutual coupling between the multiple antennas can be kept at a very low level Most importantly, all the performances are automatically determined by the pixelated design technique. Therefore, the design cycle can be greatly reduced.

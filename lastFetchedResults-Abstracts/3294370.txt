This paper gives 3000 solutions for reactive power optimization using repeated genetic algorithm. The objective function is minimization of voltage deviations at load buses and the control actions are changes in generator excitations, capacitor switching and tap changing transformers. IEEE30 bus system is the test data and simulated on MATLAB. New data prediction algorithm is given.

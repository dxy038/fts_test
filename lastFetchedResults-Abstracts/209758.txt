One of the main purposes of insurance is to influence use efficiency for
different inputs of insured farmers. This can catalyze rural development and
lead to an increase in income and welfare of farmers in rural communities.
The objective of the present study is to examine the influence of farm
product insurance on the production efficiency of agricultural operators and
economic development of rural communities. We selected farm cultivators
in Fars province as our research community. The data were collected in a
cross sectional manner and from three climatic zones including warm
sernidesert, Mediterranean, and cold mountainous in year 2005. It used multi
-stage stratified cluster sampling procedures and two groups of farmers insured
and non insured- were interviewed. The sample included 162 insured
and 248 non insured farmers. The results indicated that insurance has a
positive influence on the production of wheat cultivators in Mediterranean
zone, while its impacts on the production of wheat cultivators in semidesert,
and mountainous zones were partly negative and negative respectively. We
can conclude that insurance -with respect to increase in production - has a
random effect in most areas and farms. The increase in production is
dependent mostly on personal and managerial traits of the insured. Thus, the
promotion of crop insurance efficiency is dependent on supplying extension
services to raise fanner's awarenesS about the merits of insurance,
mechanisms to raise production and efficiency of using inputs.

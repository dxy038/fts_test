We consider survivable virtual network mapping in a multi-domain optical network with the objective of minimizing total network link cost for a given virtual traffic demand that is embedded over the multi-domain optical network. The survivability constraint guarantees the connectivity of virtual nodes after any single optical link failure. We propose a hierarchical software-defined networking (H-SDN)-based control plane to exchange information between domains, and we propose heuristic approaches for mapping virtual links onto multi-domain optical links using partition and contraction mechanisms (PCM) on the virtual topology. We show that the proposed PCM technique can reduce time complexity compared to traditional cut set graph theory approaches. Numerical results show that our heuristic approach is effective in reducing total network cost and increasing the successful mapping rate.

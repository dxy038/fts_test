Background and Objective: Using modern active and cooperative methods in teaching as student centered methods can increase students’ knowledge. In this study several teaching methods were combined to teach statistics and compared with classic method.
Materials and Methods: In this study, 20 master students of intensive care nursing, bio chemistry, biotechnology and MPH of management were divided randomly into two classic (control group) and hybrid (experimental groups) methods and the effects of teaching methods were compared. The two groups were randomly selected based on their course of study.
Results: The Man-Whitney test showed that the average score of students’ knowledge in the pre-test did not have a significant difference (p=0. 32), but in the post-test, it had a significant difference (p < 0.001). The median of students’ knowledge in experimental group was 18.09 and for control group was 13.33 (p=0.016). The students’ attitude toward the hybrid method was more positive than the classic method.  
Conclusion: The present study shows that the hybrid method is more effective than the classic method in teaching statistical concepts and students' positive attitude.

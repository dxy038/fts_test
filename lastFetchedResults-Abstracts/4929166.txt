Objective: To compare the difference of body surface infrared radiation (IR) spectrum between the point Qimen (LR14), point Danzhong (CV17) and non-acupoint control point of patients with hyperplasia of mammary gland (HMG). Methods: Sixty-eight patients with HMG were enrolled in this trail. The infrared radiation spectrum of left and right point Qimen (LR14), point Danzhong (CV17) and control point were detected by the high-sensitive PHE201 body surface infrared spectrometer, the wavelength from 1.5 m to 16 m were used. Results: There were 49 wavelengths (3.50, 4.00, 4.50~16.00 m) among 59 detected wavelengths, the IR intensity of left point Qimen (LR14) was significantly higher than that of the control point (p&lt;0.05). There were 48 wavelengths (1.75, 3.50, 4.00, 4.50~6.50, 7.00, 7.50~16.00 m) among 59 detected wavelengths, the IR intensity of right point Qimen (LR14) was significantly higher than that of the control point (p&lt;0.05). There were 13 wavelengths ( 6.75~8.25, 9.00, 9.25, 9.75, 13.25~13.75 m) among 59 detected wavelengths, the IR intensity of point Danzhong (CV17) was significantly lower than that of the control point (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The infrared radiation intensity of point Qimen (LR14) is higher than that of the control point, while the infrared radiation intensity of point Danzhong (CV17) is lower than that of the control point, which indicates that the deficiency and excess of qi and blood of points from different.

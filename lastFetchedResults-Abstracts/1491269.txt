Soil organic matter (SOM) and its different pools have key importance in optimizing crop production, minimizing negative environmental impacts, and thus improving soil quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the soil C and N contents in bulk soil and in different SOM pools (light and heavy fractions) of a clayey Rhodic Ferralsol after 13 years of different tillage and crop rotations in Passo Fundo, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from no-tillage (no soil disturbance except for sowing; NT) and conventional tillage (disc plough followed by light disc harrowings; CT) applied to wheat/soybean (W/S) and wheat/soybean–vetch/maize (W/S–V/M) rotations. As reference, soil was sampled from a non-cultivated area adjacent to the field experiment. The greatest soil C and N contents were found in non-cultivated soils in the 0–5 cm depth (45 g C kg−1 soil and 3.6 g N kg−1 soil). Crop cultivation led to a decrease in SOM content which was higher for CT soils (approx. 60% decrease in C and N contents) than NT soils (approx. 43% decrease in C and N contents) at 0–5 cm. Tillage had the greatest impact on soil C and N storage. Soils under NT did not contain higher C and N storage than CT soils below 5 cm depth. Significantly, higher amounts of organic carbon of FLF in CT (0.5–0.7 g C kg−1 soil) than in NT soils (0.2 g C kg−1 soil) at 10–20 cm depth were also observed and the differences in C and N storage between CT and NT soils in the 0–30 cm layer were not significant. Silt and clay fractions contained the largest amount of organic carbon (60–95% of total organic carbon), and free light fraction was the most sensitive pool of organic carbon to detect changes in SOM due to soil tillage and crop rotations.

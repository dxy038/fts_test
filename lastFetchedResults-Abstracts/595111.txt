Objective: The objective of this study was to demonstrate a positive correlation between female parity and the occurrence of four common perianal conditions.Material and Methods: We conducted a descriptive study, by interviewing female patients coming to the Surgical Out Patient Department or the Casualty Department complaining of any of the four perianal conditions (perianal fistulae, perianal abscesses, hemorrhoids, and anal fissures). The patients were questioned about parity and past history. Fifty patients were examined and investigated.Results: Out of the total 50 patients there were 16 patients of hemorrhoids, 24 patients of anal fissure, 6 patients of perianal fistula, 3 patients of perianal abscess and 1 patient of 1st degree piles and fissure. In all except the patients of perianal abscess, the predominant parity groups were those of multiparas and grandmultiparas, and predominant age groups were those in their late twenties to forties, the peak reproductive years.Conclusion: In the cases of hemorrhoids, anal fissures and, to a great extent, perianal fistulae, a positive correlation between parity and perianal disease is easily discernible. The disease are more prevalent in patients in their reproductive year (twenties to forties), which is in keeping with this assessment. However, results may warrant a more specific study, with a larger sampling of patients.

Applying western discourse of development in Muslim countries has had some unpleasant results, one of which has been Muslims' doubt on various and modern dilemmas of development. But what is the way that Islam opens in confronting contemporary western theories of development? (Question) Islamic discourse of development, being affected by changes of Islam history and religious reform movements, has opened a new way for Muslims based on religious teachings and Imam Khomeini's political thoughts (Hypothesis).  Investigating this discourse is possible in the light of considering religious unity, Islamic integrity, national interests and its effect on the birth and continuity of development (Method).
In the present article, we have tried to prove that Islamic discourse of development in its theoretical and practical principles enjoys appropriate firmness and consolidation (Objective). Also, we concluded that the need for public determination for implementation of the Islamic discourse, the need for establishing suitable and active civil institutions, and people's diligence and care for religious values are the prerequisites for achieving development (Findings).

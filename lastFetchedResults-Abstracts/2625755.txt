DNA is a good target for metal complexes as its base-pairs owns rich electrons.To
design better anticancer drugs, it is essential to explore the interactions of metal
complexes with DNA. The objective of this work is to study of the interaction of
Bis(2-amino-4-methyl-pyridinium)trans-diaqua-bis-(pyrazine,2,3-dicarboxylato)
cuprate(II)hexa-hydratemetal complex with calf thymus DNA, in order to
investigate the possible binding mode and to calculate the binding constant
toDNA. Absorption titration experiments were performed with a fixed
concentration of metal complex while gradually increasing the concentration of
DNA. The results show that upon increasing the concentration of DNA, the
absorption peak of metal complex at 224 nm decreases which indicates the
interaction of metal complex with DNA. The binding constant for metal complex
was estimated to be 5 Ã—105 M-1. Thus, this binding constant is similar to that of the
intercalators

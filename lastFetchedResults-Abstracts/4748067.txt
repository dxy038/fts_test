This paper presents a perceptual image quality assessment metric based on the visible differences predictor (VDP) (Daly, 1993). The proposed metric operates in two modes. In quality mode, the metric produces a single value representation of the overall visible image quality (VIQ), whereas in distortion mode, the metric provides four distortion values each associated with a specific type of image content. The correlation coefficient between the objective VIQ and subjective test results is 0.96, compared to 0.86 obtained by the PSNR measure.

We introduce a new framework for aggregating the information by using the concept of unified aggregation operators. Thus, we can deal with complex environments where the information comes from different sources. Furthermore, we also use generalized aggregation operators that includes a wide range of aggregation operators by using the concept of generalized means. We introduce the generalized unified aggregation operator (GUAO) operator. Its main advantage is that it unifies a wide range of aggregation operators according to the available information. Thus, we can use different sources of information including subjective, objective and the attitudinal character of the decision maker. We apply the new approach in a decision making problem regarding the general strategy of the public debt ratio in the convergence criteria of the European Union (EU) integration process.

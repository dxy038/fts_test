The objective fitting of hearing aids and cochlear implants in uncooperative patients still remains a challenge. Especially in determining the threshold of uncomfortable loudness which cannot be predicted from the auditory threshold. In this study, we propose a single sweeps processing method which employs a hybrid approach of adaptive frame decomposition adaptation by a tight wavelet frame and the gaussian novelty detection for the detection of large-scale electroencephalographic responses correlates of habituation in late auditory evoked potentials. For this, habituation is discerns as a novel event. It is concluded that the new approach provides a fast and reliable method in the discrimination of uncomfortable loudness level from comfortable loudness level. It can be further use in more clinically oriented studies related to an objective frequency specific fitting of hearing aids or cochlear implants.

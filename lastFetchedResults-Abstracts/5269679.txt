Summary form only given. Recently, double-shell deuterium gas puff experiments were performed on the Z accelerator with the objective of investigating the production efficiency of thermal neutrons using a Z pinch approach. In order to learn more about the dynamics of the pinch and to differentiate each shell, the deuterium was doped with argon and Freon-12 (CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>). In this work, we present 2D r-z simulations of the double-shell gas puff performed with the ALEGRA MHD code. Different methods were applied to model the doping (gas mixture vs. mix in each cell) and two radiation models were tested. A number of calculated parameters, such as radiation power pulse, X-ray yield, ion temperature, ion velocity and density profile are compared with experimental results and show reasonable agreement. Various results obtained using the two radiation models and the different doping techniques will be discussed

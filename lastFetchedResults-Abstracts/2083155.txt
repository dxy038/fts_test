Many organic hazardous pollutants such as bisphenolA (BPA) which are toxic and not easily biodegradable can concerns
for environmental pollution worldwide. The objective of this study was to examine whether Azolla Filiculoides is able to
remove BPA from aqueous solutions. In this study, the Azolla with different biomass (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2 g) has been cultured
in solution that was contained 5, 10, 25 and 50 ppm BPA. Samples were collected every 2 days from all of containers.
The analytical determination of BPA was performed by using of DR4000 uv-visible at ?max = 276 nm. The results indicated
that Azolla has high ability to remove BPA from aqueous solutions. The BPA removal was 60-90%. The removal efficiency
is increasing with decreasing of BPA concentration and increasing of biomass amount and vice versa. The removal
efficiency was more than 90% when BPA concentration was 5 ppm and amount of biomass was 0.9gr. It is concluded
that Azolla able remove BPA by Phytodegradation from the aqueous solutions. Since conventional methods of BPA
removal need to high cost and energy, phytoremediation by Azolla as a natural treatment system can decrease those
issues and it can be a useful and beneficial method to removal of BPA.

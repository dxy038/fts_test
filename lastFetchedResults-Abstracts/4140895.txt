This paper presents new algorithms-fuzzy c-medoids (FCMdd) and robust fuzzy c-medoids (RFCMdd)-for fuzzy clustering of relational data. The objective functions are based on selecting c representative objects (medoids) from the data set in such a way that the total fuzzy dissimilarity within each cluster is minimized. A comparison of FCMdd with the well-known relational fuzzy c-means algorithm (RFCM) shows that FCMdd is more efficient. We present several applications of these algorithms to Web mining, including Web document clustering, snippet clustering, and Web access log analysis

The existing mobile communication systems suffer from problems like frequency selective fading and multipath signals, multiple access interference due to imperfect non-orthogonal codes and narrowband interference due to coexisting systems. The multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) technique can combat these problems efficiently owing to its inherent properties. The objective of this work is to design an optimum receiver for the MC-CDMA system. Since multiuser interference degrades the performance of the receiver, interference cancellation technique is to be incorporated in the receiver. As parallel interference cancellation (PIC) is faster, more complex and successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme is slow, a less complex hybrid interference cancellation (HIC) scheme is arrived at combining the advantages of these two schemes. The hybrid scheme is simple, faster and reliable. Simulation results imply HIC is an optimized combination of PIC and SIC in terms of computational complexity and error performance.

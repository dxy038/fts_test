The main objective of this work is to perform an optimization methodology of the temporal parameters and operation thresholds (acceleration and energy) for the impact detection in an accelerometer smart sensor. The procedure is based on a sequential approach to values that improve the sensitivity and the specificity of the impact detection. It was fed in its execution with a set of experiments of different daily activities, with and without impact. The values of the parameters obtained from the optimization were tested with a different set of experiments achieving a 100% success (zero false positives and zero false negatives), confirming the robustness of the procedure.

Microgrids have become in an important research field in power electronics and play a key role in the Distributed Generation (DG) concept. In this paper, a fuzzy logic controller is proposed for Low Voltage (LV) microgrids, based on Voltage Source Converter (VSC) technology and DG. The control strategy designed aims the active and reactive power flow with the grid connection mode and in isolated operation, where local controllers are located with a central command which is in charge to fixing the setpoints in both cases. The VSC topology provides bidirectional energy flow by managing the SPWM signals, the modulation index and phase shift. The measurements based on Instantaneous power theory gives better accuracy in the selected feedback signals. Simulation results demonstrate the coordination and adaptability control in different study cases.

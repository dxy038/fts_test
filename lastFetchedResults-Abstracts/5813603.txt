In japanese language learning fields in recent years, Writing is always regarded as one of the major skills in japanese language learning. But in actual teaching practice, it is often a heavy burden for the teachers to view and correct the students´ compositions. It is always difficult to find objective and systematic archives for the students´ written compositions and teachers´ instructions. Owing to the consideration of the above-mentioned deficiency, we have designed and developed a correction system to help the japanese language teachers in their viewing and correcting students´ compositions. The system has many merits, such as to hand in students´ compositions through internet, view and correct compositions on computer, make comparison between the compositions before and after the teacher´s correction, the classification of student´s mistakes, and other statistic function. It has greatly reduced heavy burdens from the teachers, at the same time collected great amount of linguistic corpus. Our system has now been adopted in the Japanese language teaching practice and has got high praises from the teachers and students.

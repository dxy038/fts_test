This paper analyzes the characteristics of the traditional DEILPHI method, pointing out that the method has the shortcomings of strong subjectivity, complex data acquisition, and lack of real-time circumstance-specific solutions. It proposes an improved DEILPHI method based on objective preferences. According to the characteristics of evaluation indicators and the specific situation of actual evaluation work, this method takes different preference data to build preference matrix and amend the original DEILPHI judging matrix. In addition, based on this improved method, the article also designs the experimental environment to authenticate the example.

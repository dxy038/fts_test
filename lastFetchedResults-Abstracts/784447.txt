Objective: To assess the nutritional status of institutionalized Taiwanese elderly with the Mini
Nutritional Assessment (MNA) without BMI and to determine whether the application of population-specific
MAC and CC cutoff standards would improve the functionality of the tool. Design: Purposive sampling. Setting:
A long-term care facility in central Taiwan. Participants: Two hundred and eight >65 y residents who were free
of acute infection/diseases and were able to communicate. Measurements: A questionnaire survey to elicit
personal data and administer the MNA and measurements of anthropometric and blood biochemical indicators.
Results: The MNA, without BMI, predicted 22.1% of participants malnourished and 61.1% at risk of malnutrition
among residents of a long-term care facility in Taiwan. Replacing the population-specific cutoff standards of
MAC and CC for the original cutoff standards in the MNA and increasing the weighted score of MAC and CC to
replace for the weighted score of BMI preserved and improved the predicting ability of the MNA. The
improvement was evidenced by the increase in the correlationships between the MNA scores and the
anthropometric, biochemical or health status indicators. Conclusion: The MNA predicted nutritional risk status of
the institutionalized elderly Taiwanese. The study suggests that whenever possible population-specific
anthropometric cutoff standards should be applied to improve the functionality of the MNA. It also appears
possible to preserve or even improve the functionality of the MNA without BMI. The modifications indicate an
improvement in the application of the MNA in long-term care patients

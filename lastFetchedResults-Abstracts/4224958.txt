This paper presents an efficient method for placement of active power line conditioners (APLC) in a harmonic polluted power system. The planning problem is formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem. In the proposed approach, the probabilistic characteristics of voltage, current and impedance of fundamental component and harmonics in a power system are also considered. The objective function is the total harmonic voltage distortion of the system. The APLC siting indices are computed to find the most suitable APLC locations. Simulation results obtained by testing an actual distribution system show that the proposed method is robust and computationally efficient.

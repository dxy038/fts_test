Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems (NGAS) is developing an Advanced Heterogeneous Integration (AHI) process to integrate III-V semiconductor chiplets on CMOS wafers under the Compound Semiconductor Materials on Silicon (COSMOS) DARPA program. The objective of the program is to have a heterogeneous interconnect pitch and length less than 5 um to enable intimate transistor scale integration. This integration will enable significant improvement in dynamic range and bandwidth of high performance mixed signal circuits.

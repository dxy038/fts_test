An intelligent tracing algorithm based on machine vision is described in this paper. The proposed system is comprised of a model car and the microcontroller XS128 using to design and implement the intelligent tracing system. The objective of this machine vision system is to implement an intelligent tracing system, which can track a black line as fast and stable as possible. The process of the tracing algorithm consists of image signal acquisition, target black line extraction, interpolation filter anti-jamming, path fitting and trend prediction.

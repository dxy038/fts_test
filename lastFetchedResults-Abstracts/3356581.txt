In the large volume of traffic and bad weather conditions, the traffic of accessing and leaving the highway toll station often have severe traffic congestion, will significantly increase the probability of traffic accident, severely restricted the passage efficiency of highway toll station and urban road. In this paper, in depth study on the traffic characteristics of the highway and urban road junction, effective control of the accessing and leaving highway toll station target vehicle in the junction by the control method of different levels of response, unidirectional signal control method in case of different levels of response and bidirectional signal control method based on red superimposed compensation are given, the result provided a theoretical basis for signal control of the junction. Finally, an example is given in order to calculate the actual case.

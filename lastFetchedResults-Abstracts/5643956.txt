In this paper, a study of the behavior of wireless mesh networks is proposed, by considering energy consumption and reliability of the network. The real consumption with different network topologies and different data profiles will be analized. The objective of this work is to establish the framework to carry out energy optimizations in order to reduce the energy consumption without losing the reliability and efficiency of the network.

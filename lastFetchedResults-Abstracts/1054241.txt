The objective is to measure the coefficient of friction for composite in contact with composite in reciprocal sliding as it is important for modeling bolted joints and predicting their failure load. The wear mechanisms have been studied using scanning electron microscope and contact surfaces from a fatigue-loaded joint have been studied on a carbon fiber/epoxy matrix composite, HTA-6376. While the value of initial coefficient of friction recorded was 0.65 that for the peak after wear in was 0.74, suggesting that a significant part of the applied load to a joint at quasi-static failure will be transferred by friction force. Since all wear mechanisms observed in the friction specimen were also observed in the joint specimen it is possible to use the measured coefficient of friction from the friction specimens on the joints. The main wear mechanisms were slow wear of the matrix on the original surface and cracking of the fiberâ€“matrix interface, causing both the matrix and fibers to exhibit fracture.

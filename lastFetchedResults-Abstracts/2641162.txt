Objective: The aim of the current research was to determine the components of  professional development among the faculty members of the Physical Education and Sport Sciences and assessing its fit. 
Methodology: The survey was conducted through field study. The statistical population consisted of all the faculty members of physical education and sport sciences (N=205). The statistical sample was considered equal to the statistical population. The questionnaires were distributed among the participants and 173 ones were returned and analyzed. The structured questionnaire of Professional Development was used to collect data. Nine dimensions of professional development was identified through preliminary literature study. Then, six dimensions were confirmed by the experts' ideas as follows;  research; specialty service; scientific publications; information and communication technologies and networks; English language skill; and teaching. The content validity and constructs validity of the instrument were approved by the specialistsâ€™ views and confirmatory factor analysis respectively. The reliability of the questionnaire was determined through Cronbach alpha with coefficient of 0.90. Descriptive statistics were used to categorize the findings and inferential statistics (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Pearson correlation coefficient and one sample t-test) were used for analyzing data. Also, SEM (structural equations model) was used to examine the causal relationship by LISREL 9.2. 
Results: The analysis supported the process of fitting model to data . The results showed that the development model of the faculty members had desirable goodness. The dimension of scientific publications (3.79) and English language skill (3.98) were below average.

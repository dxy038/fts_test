Watermarking is the art of hiding intellectual property information into digital media for the purpose of copyright protection. 3D laser scanned archeological models consume an essential effort to build up a final pruned 3D model. The model is then deployed online through insecure channel. Our objective is to watermark the 3D scanned archeological models by embedding the ownership information into it. One of the main challenges of mesh watermarking is to avoid the convergence problem. The convergence problem will be solved by our proposed Nearest Neighbor Move (NNM) technique. In NNM the vertex position will be changed slightly to meet a predefined relationship between the vertex position and its projection on the opposite edge in each triangle of the triangular mesh. Results showed that the perturbing of vertices is reduced compared to the previous methods, in addition the watermark is embedded only in the bumpy regions which are imperceptible by Human Visual System. NNM showed a comparatively enhancement in the mesh quality and the convergence problem is successfully solved.

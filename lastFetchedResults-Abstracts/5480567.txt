A new and rapid scheme for detecting vehicles based on video by single camera at urban intersection is proposed. Firstly a rapid judgment algorithm of vehicle direction is introduced, with motion object segmentation by means of frame-difference method and morphology. It extracts the unique interested region from multiple objective through the modified region-growth algorithm, gets motion direction by 16 adjacent blocks matching using MAD criterion. Secondly, a new scheme is designed associating the above algorithm with <i>virtual test line method</i> in single direction. Moreover, a video detection system is developed on <i>VC++</i> and DirectShow platform. Experimental results show that the accuracy rate of vehicle direction judgment is over 94% and the whole system can realize traffic statistics effectively.

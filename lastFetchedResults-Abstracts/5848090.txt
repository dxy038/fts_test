Starting from the deregulated process of the electric sector, there was the need to attribute responsibilities to several agents and to elaborate appropriate forms of remuneration of the services rendered by the same. A class of services that has been receiving great emphasis after the restructuring of the electric sector is the reactive support. With the objective of remunerating in an appropriate way the several agents involved in the supply and the use of this service, this work presents a methodology that seeks to optimize the reactive support rendered by the generating agents and to identify the level of responsibility of each agent that may use this service. The proposed methodology uses a linear optimal power flow, whose objective function is to minimize the reactive power of the buses system. The problem complies with a group of restrictions. The proposed methodology was tested from a system of 8 buses and presented results that motivate the intensification of this research line.

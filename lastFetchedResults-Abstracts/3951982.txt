This paper proposes a control method for limiting the torque of grid-connected cage induction machines during the recovery process after grid faults, by using a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) connected at the machine terminals. When a STATCOM is used for transient stability improvement, common practice is to design the control system to keep reactive current at maximum level until the voltage has returned to its initial value. This will result in high torques during the recovery process after grid faults. The control method proposed in this paper is intended to limit such torque transients by temporarily defining a new voltage reference for the STATCOM control system. As torque is controlled through the voltage reference of the STATCOM, the method is labeled indirect torque control (ITC). The presented concept is a model-based approach derived from a quasi-static equivalent circuit of the induction machine, the STATCOM and a The??venin representation of the power system. For illustration and verification, time-domain simulations of a wind power generation system with a STATCOM at the terminals of an induction generator, are provided. As the objective of limiting the torque of the induction machine is achieved, the derivation of the concept proves to be reasonable. The approach is presented in its most general form, oriented to torque limitation of induction machines both in generating and motoring mode, and is not restricted to the presented example.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether plasma from women with severe preeclampsia stimulates the production of endothelial cell interleukin-6 production and whether vitamin E could inhibit this process. Study Design: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in the presence of 5% plasma from women with severe preeclampsia (n = 12) or healthy pregnant women at term (n = 12), with or without 50 Î¼mol/L vitamin E. Levels of interleukin-6 in plasma and human umbilical vein endothelial cell-conditioned media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Interleukin-6 levels were elevated 5-fold in preeclamptic plasma compared with normal pregnant plasma (P< .05). Human umbilical vein endothelial cell interleukin-6 production was increased 25% by preeclamptic plasma compared with normal pregnant plasma (P< .005), and increased interleukin-6 production by preeclamptic plasma was inhibited by vitamin E. Conclusion: Endothelial cell activation by preeclamptic plasma stimulates interleukin-6 production, which is inhibited by vitamin E. These findings provide a potential cellular mechanism for the beneficial effects of antioxidant therapy in preeclampsia. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:740-4.)

This paper deals with a new ZCS bidirectional buck-boost converter for the energy storage applications. The conventional buck-boost converter is upgraded with an auxiliary resonant circuit to obtain the zero current switching during commutation of main IGBTs. The key advantage of this proposed topology has the reduced switching losses, as all the switching devices are operated in ZCS soft-switching operation. This paper largely focused on analysis and simulation evaluation of the boost and buck mode operations with soft-switching. This paper describes the operation principles and simulation results of the converter to verify the theoretical assumptions and its performance.

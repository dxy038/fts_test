A state traversal algorithm based on control theory and its application to sequential ATPG is presented. In the algorithm, next states are evaluated by an objective function representing "unlikeliness" to reach each of the previously traversed states. Experimental results show that many states are efficiently traversed and that our proposed ATPG can achieve almost the same fault coverage as STG3.

Running scientific workflows in distributed environments is motivating the definition of provenance approaches that are loosely coupled to the workflow system. This kind of approach is interesting because it allows both storage and access to provenance data in an integrated way, even in an environment where different workflow management systems work together. In order to provide provenance functionalities, the existing approaches overload scientists with many manually computing tasks, such as script adaptations and implementations of extra functionalities. However, when we are dealing with users who do not have such expertise (the majority of scientists do not have it), this is not a good solution. Hence, the objective of this paper is to define a provenance strategy that facilitates the gathering of provenance information in a distributed environment scenario.

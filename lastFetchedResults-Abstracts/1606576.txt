Soil pollution by heavy metals is an important environment issue throughout the world. Heavy metals’ origin, accumulation, and distribution in soil have been the focus of much attention by many researchers. The objective of this study was to recognize the sources of some heavy metals in surface soils in Zob-Ahan industrial district, Isfahan province,  using multivariate geostatistical techniques. A total of 202 surface (0–30 cm) soil samples were collected. Total lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) contents of the samples were determined. A multivariate geostatistical analysis was performed to identify the common source of heavy metals. The results of principal component analysis led to the identification of three components. So, these components were explained 31, 27, and 16 % of total variance of heavy metal concentration, respectively. The distribution of scores of each components were shown that the quantities of Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn were found to be associated with anthropogenic activities, corresponding to the first factor was termed the “anthropogenic component”. The quantities of Co were found to be associated with parent rocks, corresponding to the second factor was termed the “lithologic component”. Also, the third factor was mainly attributed to Cu, Ni and Cr which also comprised the first and third factors, indicating a mixed source both from lithologic and anthropogenic inputs.

In computer graphics it often required to interface various display devices in the system. Each display device should provide high resolutionary image quality. The proposed method enhances the display performance of the graphic device interface. Wepropose anovel application for image fusion methods whichworks on different raster operations to improve the quality of picture for higher or lower resolution interfaces. We have used image fusion performance considerations such entropy, Mean intensity value, standard deviation, RMSE and PSNR etc to evaluate the interface results. Simulation results show that all raster operations be it blend or merge of source and/or destination images deliver superior objective as well as quantitative results and provide enhanced image quality for graphic data interface.

Objective
The objective of our study was to investigate and evaluate the relationship between road traffic noise and cardiovascular risk.
Methods

The study sample (n = 659; 36.9% male, 63.1% female university students, mean age 22.83 ± 1.58 years) included a group exposed to road traffic noise (n = 280, Leq,24 h = 67 ± 2 dB(A)) and a control group (n = 379, Leq,24 h = 58.7 ± 6 dB(A)). Subjective response was determined by a validated noise annoyance questionnaire. The ten year risk of developing a coronary heart disease event was quantified as an evaluation of cardiovascular risk (SCORE60, Framingham 10-year risk estimation and projection to the age of 60, relative risk SCORE chart).
Results

Cardiovascular risk scores were significantly higher in the exposed group based on the Framingham scores projected to the age of 60, SCORE60 (AOR = 2.72 (95% CI = 1.21–6.15)) and the relative risk SCORE chart (AOR = 2.81 (1.46–5.41)).
Conclusions

These findings highlight the association between road traffic noise and cardiovascular risk.

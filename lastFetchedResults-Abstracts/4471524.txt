According to the characteristics of the perishable agricultural products, and applying ExtendSim system simulation software, we build a metamorphic rate (t, R, S) inventory system model of agricultural products. In the initial inventory demand random, given inventory level conditions, we use a day on average total cost in inventory as the objective function. Through the ExtendSim Optimizer optimization simulation module, we obtain the best inventory strategy.

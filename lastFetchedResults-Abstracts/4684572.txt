Co-occurrence data matrices arise frequently in various important applications such as a document clustering. By considering a multinomial mixture model, we present a new probabilistic Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for clustering and visualizing this kind of data. Contrary to SOM, our proposed learning algorithm optimizes an objective function. Its performances are evaluated by using Monte Carlo simulations and real datasets.

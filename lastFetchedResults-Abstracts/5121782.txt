This research investigates the impact of three different control devices and two visualization methods on the precision, safety and ergonomics of a new medical robotic system prototype for assistive laser phonomicrosurgery. This system allows the user to remotely control the surgical laser beam using either a flight simulator type joystick, a joypad, or a pen display system in order to improve the traditional surgical setup composed by a mechanical micromanipulator coupled with a surgical microscope. The experimental setup and protocol followed to obtain quantitative performance data from the control devices tested are fully described here. This includes sets of path following evaluation experiments conducted with ten subjects with different skills, for a total of 700 trials. The data analysis method and experimental results are also presented, demonstrating an average 45% error reduction when using the joypad and up to 60% error reduction when using the pen display system versus the standard phonomicrosurgery setup. These results demonstrate the new system can provide important improvements in terms of surgical precision, ergonomics and safety. In addition, the evaluation method presented here is shown to support an objective selection of control devices for this application.

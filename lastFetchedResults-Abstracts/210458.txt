Objective: Growth and development are the characteristic features of childhood. Growth is
the increase of height and weight along the time. Intrauterine growth retardation (lUGR) is
defined by a birth body weight deviation greater than two standard deviations from the
population mean, and is presented in two forms: symmetric and asymmetric. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the prevalence of intrauterine growth retardation and its pattern among
neonates born in Imam Khomeini university hospital in Ahwaz.
Subjects and methods: In this cross-sectional study, all neonates borne in the first 6 months
of 1384 (2005) in Emam Khomeini university hospital of Ahwaz were studied.Gestational
Age (according to LMP & Ballard criteria), body birth weight, length and ponderal index (PI)
were measured among IUGR neonates. Calculation of PI was made by use of the following
relationship: PI= [weight in g x 100 /(height in ern)"]. Correlation of PI with sex, gestational
age, parity, maternal education and age were also assessed.
Results: The prevalence of IUGR in our study was 4.03%. Where 80% of these cases were
asymmetric and 20% symmetric, with 60% males and 40% females. There was a direct
correlation between PI and sex (higher in females), maternal age, gestational age to 40th week
and parity. But there was no significant statistical correlation between PI and maternal
education.
Conclusion: The prevalence of IUGR among our study population was high and it seems that
determination of PI is a simple and appropriate method for assessment of proportion of IUGR
neonates. Promotion of knowledge of family and society, and attention to daughters' health
from early childhood is recommended

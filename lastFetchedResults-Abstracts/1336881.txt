In the horse, the body condition score (BCS) system to assess subcutaneous fat deposition is a useful tool for making feeding management decisions. The system includes assessing fat deposition at six body areas (neck, withers, shoulders, ribs, loin, and tail head) and was developed in Quarter Horse mares. It has not been tested for use on other breeds or genders, possibly compromising the system's ability to describe fat accretion in other classes of horse. The objective of this study was to examine the ability of the previously developed fat accretion characteristics to describe fat deposition in mature Thoroughbred (TB) geldings. An additional goal was to determine whether fewer body areas could be used. Fifteen mature TB geldings were fed for weight gain over an 8-month period on one of two diets and were independently assessed for BCS on a monthly basis by two judges. BCS was determined by averaging the scores that were assigned to each of the six body areas. Fat accretion characteristics were also recorded. Across both diets, the neck area scored significantly higher than the withers and loin (P < 0.05) throughout the study. A BCS derived only from the body areas of neck, shoulders, ribs, and tailhead was found to accurately predict the six body areaâˆ’derived mean BCS. The results of this study provide justification for modifications of the BCS system for use in TB geldings and also demonstrated that fewer body areas can be used to accurately predict mean BCS.

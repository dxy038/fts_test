Objectives
Oral and systemic cells are permanently exposed to various types of xenobiotics, such as dental restorative materials, which may subsequently cause adverse effects. Objective of the present investigation was to analyze the effects of three important resin monomers on the glutathione metabolism of human gingival fibroblasts after an incubation period of 4 h.
Methods

Cells were exposed to various concentrations of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA; 0.1–10 mM), triethylene-glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA; 0.05–2.5 mM), and urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA; 0.005–0.25 mM). Subsequently, cellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations were determined after a treatment period of 4 h using the monobromobimane assay. Data were statistically evaluated using Tukey ANOVA with p<0.05.
Results

GSH depletion was dependent on the type of the resin monomer: UDMA>TEGDMA>HEMA. The concentrations for a 50%-reduction of cellular GSH varied between 0.1 mM (0.05 mM) (UDMA), 0.33 mM (0.09 mM) (TEGDMA), and 1.6 mM (0.8 mM) (HEMA). Simultaneously, no decrease of cell numbers was found at any tested concentration.
Significance

These data indicate that the investigated resins may cause cell damage due to depletion of intracellular GSH level even at low concentrations within a short period of time. The decrease of GSH is an early reaction, which is triggered prior to other cytotoxic alterations.

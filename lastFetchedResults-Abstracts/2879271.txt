The main objective of this paper is to present major challenges regarding the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications propagation modelling work in the European 7<sup>th</sup> framework project METIS (Mobile and wireless communications Enablers for the Twenty-twenty Information Society). The goal of the propagation work in METIS is to provide adequate propagation models for 5G. For this purpose corresponding deficiencies of present commonly used models are identified. Further, the lack of available channel models for several propagation scenarios has been assessed. Based on this assessment the framework of 5G channel modelling is sketched. As propagation measurement campaigns are a crucial part of this work they are illustrated with a few examples.

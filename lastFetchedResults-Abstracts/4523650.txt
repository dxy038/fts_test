Internet presents problems of congestion and loss of packages due to an inefficient use of the network resources. The present technologies of routing are not enabled to surpass these problems, which with the course of the time worsen significantly. Before this dilemma, sciences of the computation make studies to develop new techniques that offer a better yield. In this sense, the present article presents/displays the design of a routing algorithm (ant route), based on the metaheuristic ant colony optimization, whose objective is to reduce the time of congestion in the connections of a network, and with it to improve the total efficiency of a network OSP.

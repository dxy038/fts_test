The identification of molecular determinants of tumor cell survival is an important objective in cancer research. Here, we describe a small-molecule kinase inhibitor (RGB-286147), which, besides inhibiting tumor cell cycle progression, exhibits potent cytotoxic activity toward noncycling tumor cells, but not nontransformed quiescent fibroblasts. Extensive yeast three-hybrid (Y3H)-based proteome/kinome scanning with chemical dimerizers revealed CDK1/2/3/5/7/9 and the less well-characterized CDK-related kinases (CRKs) p42/CCRK, PCTK1/3, and PFTK1 as its predominant targets. Thus, RGB-286147 is a proteome-wide CDK/CRK-specific kinase inhibitor whose further study could yield new insight into molecular determinants of tumor cell survival. Our results also suggest that the [1, 3, 6]-tri-substituted-pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine-4-one kinase inhibitor scaffold is a promising template for the rational design of kinase inhibitors with potential applications to disease indications other than cancer, such as neurodegeneration, cardiac hypertrophic growth, and AIDS.

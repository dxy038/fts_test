Main objective of this study is to investigate an applicability of a steady-state heat transfer correlation to pressure transient sequences and an effect of the pressure transient rates on the overall heat transfer rates under the supercritical pressures. Heat transfer rates are brought in line for both the pressure increasing and the pressure decreasing transients. And effects of pressure transient rates on heat transfer rates are trivial. As for an applicability of steady-state heat transfer correlation to the pressure transient sequences, the heat transfer correlation always overestimates the Nusselt number measured in the pressure transient heat transfer experiments by average 30%.

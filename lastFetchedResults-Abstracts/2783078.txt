A comparative design study of ultra-low-power discrete-time &#916;&#931; modulators (DT &#916;&#931;Ms) suited for medical implant devices is presented. Aiming to reduce the analog power consumption, the objective is to investigate the effectiveness of the switched-capacitor passive filter. Two design variants of 2nd-order &#916;&#931;Ms are analyzed and compared to a power-optimized standard active modulator (&#916;&#931;M<sub>AA</sub>). The first variant (&#916;&#931;M<sub>AP</sub>) employs an active filter in the 1st stage and a passive filter in the less critical 2nd stage. The second variant (OTA-less &#916;&#931;M<sub>PP</sub>) makes use of passive filters in both stages. For practical verification, all three modulators are implemented on a single chip in 65 nm CMOS technology. Designed for 500-Hz signal bandwidth, the &#916;&#931;M<sub>AA</sub>, &#916;&#931;M<sub>AP</sub>, and &#916;&#931;M<sub>PP</sub> achieve 76 dB, 70 dB and 67 dB peak SNDR, while consuming 2.1 &#956;W, 1.27 &#956;W, and 0.92 &#956;W, respectively, from a 0.9 V supply. Furthermore, the &#916;&#931;M<sub>PP</sub> can operate at a supply voltage reduced to 0.7 V, achieving a 65 dB SNDR at 430 nW power and 0.296 pJ/step.

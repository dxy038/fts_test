We report on a novel high-performance metal-insulator-metal tunnel diode, with ultrathin atomic layer deposited Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, for bidirectional selector applications in resistive switching memory. The diode exhibits high drive current of over 10<sup>5</sup> A/cm<sup>2</sup>, high nonlinearity, and fast turn-on and turn-off times in the below-ns range. A very good uniformity for structures down to 40 nm size and excellent ac endurance is demonstrated, well exceeding the stand-alone nonvolatile memory requirements.

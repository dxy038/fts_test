Objective
Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a group of pathogen-associated microbial pattern recognition receptors, play an important role in innate immune signaling and are differentially regulated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. However, the involvement of TLRs in the progression of atherosclerosis is still unclear.
Methods and results
TLR2 and apolipoprotein E double knockout (Tlr2−/−Apoe−/−) mice were generated and the progressive formation of atherosclerotic plaque in the aortas was examined in mice fed a normal chow diet. We demonstrate that inactivation of TLR2 resulted in reduced progression of atherosclerosis in both male and female Apoe−/− mice. Likewise, TLR2 deficiency resulted in a reduction in lipid accumulation and decreased macrophage recruitment to the aortic sinus, as well as reduced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels. Furthermore, macrophages isolated from Tlr2−/−Apoe−/− mice demonstrated significantly reduced MCP-1 production upon stimulation with a TLR2 ligand. However, no differences in acetylated low-density lipoprotein uptake and foam cell formation were observed in macrophages isolated from Tlr2−/−Apoe−/− mice as compared to Apoe−/− mice.
Conclusions
TLR2 plays a critical role in the progression of atherosclerosis in Apoe−/− mice, which is independent of dietary lipids and macrophage lipid uptake.

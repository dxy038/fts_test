This paper deals with the influence of global and local objective image parameters of the analyzed image on the process of finding corresponding points. We examined the impact of objective parameters on the usability of some significant point detectors. Moreover, the paper also contains the comparison of the reliability of finding corresponding points for a particular image point by using common methods and our new proposed method in dependency on some image objective parameters. The executed test confirms the advantage of the designed method. Specific improvement of the original method for finding corresponding points was proposed and described in this paper too.

The provision of multiclass services is gaining wide acceptance and will be more ubiquitous in future wireless and mobile systems. The crucial issue is to provide the guaranteed mobile quality of service (QoS) for arriving multiclass calls. In multimedia cellular networks, we should not only minimize the dropping rate of handoff calls, but also control the blocking rate of new calls at an acceptable level. This paper proposes a novel multiclass call-admission-control mechanism that is based on a dynamic reservation pool for handoff requests. In this paper, we propose the concept of servicing multiclass connections based on priority determination through the combined analysis of mobile movement information and the desired QoS requirements of multimedia traffic. A practical framework is provided to determine the occurrence time of handoff-request reservations. In our simulation experiments, three kinds of timers are introduced for controlling the progress of discrete events. Our simulation results show that the individual QoS criteria of multiclass traffic such as the handoff call-dropping probability can be achieved within a targeted objective and the new-call-blocking probability is constrained to be below a given level. The proposed scheme is applicable to channel allocation of multiclass calls over high-speed wireless multimedia networks.

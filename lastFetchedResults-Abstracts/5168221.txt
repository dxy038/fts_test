This paper introduces a study of space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) technique and explain the switching state algorithm for three phase voltage source inverter based on volt-sec balance equation. The main objective of this switching state algorithm (SSA) is that it gives the clear picture about the space vector modulation (SVM) wave generation and time for each switch operation in each sector. This SVM wave is compared with sine modulation wave. Simulation results for 20 hp induction motor drive for both SVMPWM and sine triangle PWM techniques are presented and compared.

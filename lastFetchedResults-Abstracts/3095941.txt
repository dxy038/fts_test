Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2006 has the objective to optimally assess the QT interval measurements for 549 ECGs. The challenge poses two problems: 1) the identification of representative normal beats and 2) accurate determination of the QT interval for these single beats. All QT intervals and other relevant information for the 549 ECGs have been annotated by a combination of independent standard algorithms. An inclusion ellipse has been constructed around the centroid of the Poincare Plot using quasi-robust estimation. The first beat in time sequence view covered by the ellipse was annotated for Q and Tend in lead II. 544 out of all 549 ECGs could be evaluated for QT in lead II. The QT values summarize to a mean value of 366.9 ms (median 366 ms) and a standard deviation (SD) of 49.6 ms with a range between 236 ms and 569 ms, the RR mean was 831 ms (median 807 ms) with a range from 368 ms to 1804 ms and a SD of 191 ms.

This paper outlines an active heave compensation system used in conjunction with a crown mounted compensator. The objective is to reduce the heave disturbance at the suspended load above sea floor using an active sub-system comprising controller, sensors and a suitable hydraulic power unit driving an actuator attached to the compensator. In this case the compensator system behaves much like a spring mass system and is described by a second order differential equation.

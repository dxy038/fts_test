Objective: We compared the mitogenic effect of basic fibroblast growth factor with and without estradiol on myometrial and leiomyometrial cells.
Study Design: The mitogenic effect of basic fibroblast growth factor on myometrial cells was measured by thymidine incorporation and cell count. The mitogenic effect of basic fibroblast growth factor with and without estradiol as measured by thymidine incorporation was compared between myometrial and leiomyometrial cells.
Results: Both human myometrial and leiomyometrial cells showed significant (p = 0.004 and p = 0.001, respectively), dose-dependent incorporation of thymidine in response to basic fibroblast growth factor. Leiomyometrial cells showed significantly (p = 0.04) less thymidine incorporation compared with matched normal myometrial cells. The addition of estradiol with basic fibroblast growth factor did not result in a further increase in thymidine incorporation.
Conclusions: Both myometrial and leiomyometrial cells respond to basic fibroblast growth factor with increased thymidine incorporation; however leiomyometrial cells are less responsive than are matched normal myometrial cells. The addition of estradiol is not synergistic with basic fibroblast growth factor.

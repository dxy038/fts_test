In this paper, the design problem of reverse logistics networks for waste product recycling under fuzzy environment is addressed considering waste product recovery rate. This problem is formulated as a multi-objective mixed integer fuzzy programming. The number of warehousing points, the capacity level of each warehousing point, the location of these warehousing points, and the area covered by each point is determined by this model. Also, whether price subsides should be given is discussed. Through the analysis of an example, the proposed method is demonstrated that it can present how the optimal decisions will change when the recovery rate increases under different confidence levels.With the proposed method, how the recovery rate can further increase at different recovery rate levels is explained. And the distribution diagrams before and after establishing the recycling network of the example are also presented.

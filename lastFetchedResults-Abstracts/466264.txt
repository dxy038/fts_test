Objective: Neutrophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Because preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction result from similar placental lesions, the aim of this study was to investigate neutrophil activation in isolated intrauterine growth restriction relative to preeclampsia and uncomplicated pregnancy. Polymorphonuclear neutrophil activation was analyzed by measuring cell surface and soluble cell adhesion molecule expressions. Study Design: -Selectin (CD62 ) and CD11b surface expressions on polymorphonuclear neutrophils were analyzed in 13 women with preeclampsia, 11 women with isolated intrauterine growth restriction, and 17 age- and gestation-matched control women by means of a standardized quantitative flow cytometry assay. Serum levels of soluble  -selectin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Neutrophils from women with isolated intrauterine growth restriction and women with preeclampsia displayed higher levels of CD11b and lower levels of CD62  than did neutrophils from healthy pregnant women. Soluble  -selectin serum levels were significantly increased in the preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction groups relative to normal values. No significant difference in the levels of CD11b, CD62 , and soluble  -selectin were observed between women with isolated intrauterine growth restriction and those with preeclampsia. Leukocyte activation was not correlated with disease severity. Conclusion: The observed alteration in polymorphonuclear neutrophil adhesion molecule expressions and increased serum soluble  -selectin levels are consistent with activation of peripheral blood neutrophils occurring in isolated intrauterine growth restriction in a manner similar to that seen in preeclampsia. This evidence of neutrophil activation may help to advance our understanding of the disease process in isolated intrauterine growth restriction. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:1558-63.)

Objective
The objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of the vaginal paravaginal repair using porcine dermal graft reinforcement for the correction of advanced anterior vaginal prolapse.
Study design
One hundred eleven women underwent reinforced vaginal paravaginal repair between September 2001 and January 2004 and met our inclusion criteria. Postoperatively patients were evaluated at 6 weeks, 6 months, and yearly thereafter. Objective cure was defined as point Ba –1 or less.
Results
Eighty-nine of the 111 (80%) patients were available for follow-up. Mean age of patients was 59.5 ± 11.6 years (range 26 to 82), mean body mass index was 29 ± 5.5 (range 20 to 44), and median parity was 3 (range 0 to 15). Mean follow-up was 24 ± 10.1 months (range 6 to 44) with minimum follow-up required for cure of 12 months. Overall cure rate was 78% (68 of 89). Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank test.
Conclusion
The reinforced vaginal paravaginal repair procedure is safe and effective for correction of advanced anterior vaginal prolapse.

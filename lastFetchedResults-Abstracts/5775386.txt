The Communication Analysis System (CAS) consists of data collection and analysis software that assists the clinician in providing effective and efficient rehabilitation treatment for persons with aphasia or language impairments after stroke or brain injury. It provides automated recording, filing, and graphing of functional communicative (behavioral) data so that the clinician and patient have objective, accurate, timely data displays with which to analyze the effects of intervention procedures. Thus treatment activities can be titrated for maximum progress. Therapy is better organized and managed and communication to families and other professionals is enhanced. Since the model provides absolute measures (like inches or meters) of behavioral function, the data are directly comparable across rehabilitation disciplines, functions and disabilities

Application of simulation-optimization models to the problem of optimal design and operation of multi-reservoir hydropower systems with control on the reliability of meeting the system’s energy yield could be a suitable approach to solve the resulting mixed integer nonlinear, nonconvex optimization model. An optimization-simulation model has been developed in this study by integrating MODSIM river basin simulation model and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. First, the possibility of defining an energy demand-node and applying a hydropower standard operating policy (HSOP) in MODSIM was provided. Then the extended simulation model (MODSIMP) was linked to the PSO algorithm with the objective function of maximization of the net benefit from the system’s design and operation over its projected life period. In the developed model, each objective function evaluation of PSO is performed by running MODSIMP. Analysis of the PSO-MODSIMP model results was done through its application to the problem of optimal design and operation of the Khersan multireservoir hydropower system as a real case study. Computational efficiency of the MODSIMP in simulating the operation of multireservoir hydropower systems and the flexibility of the PSO algorithm in considering the model nonlinearity has provided a promising modeling tool in tackling the problem of optimal design and operation of multi-reservoir hydropower systems.

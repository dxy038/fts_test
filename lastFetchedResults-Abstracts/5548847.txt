Peer-to-Peer overlays have become a popular paradigm for building distributed systems, aiming to provide resource localization and sharing in large-scale networks. To design an overlay network, the first step is to choose an overlay topology connecting all the overlay nodes. Many proposed distributed hash table schemes for peer-to-peer network are based on some traditional calculated interconnection topologies. In this paper, we propose to extend the DHT topology to a bidirectional graph to provide a super-peer based lookup algorithm and a scalable resource localization support. We consider bidirectional routing algorithms and show how the resulting unfair routing structure extends the search region and provides an efficient resource lookup service at a very little additional cost.

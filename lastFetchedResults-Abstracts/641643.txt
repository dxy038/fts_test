OBJECTIVE: We describe the effect of the metabolic and nutritional modifications caused by severe illness or injury in brain-dead organ donors on transplant organ function. Malnutrition is frequently found in brain-dead organ donors and nutrients may interfere with different organ functions.

METHODS: Literature was obtained from MEDLINE using the key words organ donation, brain death, transplantation, nutrition, fish oil, amino acids.

RESULTS: In the liver, infusion of large quantities of dextrose can restore glycogen reserves but may induce hyperglycemia and a hyperosmolar hepatic state. Feeding improves protein synthesis in hepatocytes, and fat (fish oil) administration in particular increases the hepatic energy and adenosine triphosphate content. Amino acids have a significant effect on regenerating hepatic tissue when given with fat and glucose. In the heart, free fatty acids administered during reperfusion improve cardiac functional recovery, and administration of propofol, a general anesthetic agent enriched with fatty acids, have protective effects on ischemia-and-reperfusion injury. Glutamine also can induce graft protection during ischemia-and-reperfusion injury. Renal function is improved by fish oil supplementation. In addition, effective renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, and renal blood flow are increased, apparently by a reduction in thromboxane B2 production. Glycine or alanine can protect renal tubules from stress injury.

CONCLUSION: Nutrition plays an important role in the modulation of organ function after transplantation.

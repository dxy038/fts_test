Objective
riodontal ligament (PDL) is a fibrous connective tissue composed of heterogeneous cell types, including PDL fibroblasts. It is not clear whether cells within the PDL fibroblast population retain the potency to differentiate into other cell types.

 present study, clonal cell lines, derived from Clawn miniature swine PDLs, were established by gene transfection for a human telomerase reverse transcriptase, and characterized.
s
cell lines, denoted TesPDL1–4, had PDL fibroblasts that showed fibroblastic morphology and expressed procollagen α1(I), osteopontin, periostin and alkaline phosphatase mRNA. Under the specific culture conditions, TesPDL3 cells also have the ability to express CD31, vascular endothelial cadherin, von Willebrand factor, osteocalcin, and to form extracellular mineralized nodules.
sions
ta indicate that TesPDL3 cells have unique properties of expressing several phenotype of fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells and osteoblasts in cultures.

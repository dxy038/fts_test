Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a vision of an environment with ubiquitous distributed devices embedded in everyday objects that are interconnected and seamlessly deliver applications and services. Based on concepts of ubiquitous computing, ubiquitous communication and intelligent interfaces, AmI puts the user in the center of future technological development. In this paper we consider human aspects of AmI in clinical scenarios. Our main objective is to extend process notations with human aspects which are then considered during system implementation. This is done in the context of a model for usability evaluation and a clinical application scenario. The usability evaluation model includes inspection methods such as cognitive walkthrough and action analysis, as well as test methods, such as questionnaires and expert interviews. Our preliminary results show the viability of the approach.

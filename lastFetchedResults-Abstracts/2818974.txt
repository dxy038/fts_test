File sharing in peer to peer system is a complicated and challenging problem due to the large scale of network and highly transient population of peer. Applying effective coding technique called network coding in peer to peer file sharing is still a relatively new area of study. Instead of simply store and forward a packet, network coding is applied at all intermediate nodes to make data dissemination more effective. Also it reduces the burden of the original seeder. Random Linear Network Coding has been developed to improve the performance of many peer to peer applications which includes file sharing. Network coding introduced the randomization, to make data scheduling in peer to peer ease. In the proposed system, each peer can collaborates with other peers by the help of network coding to deliver a large volume of content among the entire peer in the network. Each peer can know the status of other peer by make use of Netware Link State Routing Protocol. The packet arrival and departure operations to and from each node will be monitored and recorded in the table. Each peer can make use of this table to generate the innovative coded block. The block will be called as innovative coded block if it is benefited for more number of peers to complete their downloading process in minimum time. The main objective of this work is to maximize the innovative coded block information and minimize the redundant block flow in network based content distribution. The proposed work is simulated using NS2 and results shows that it works well against peer churn, reduces the peer download time and improves the throughput with compare to traditional content distribution using with and without network coding.

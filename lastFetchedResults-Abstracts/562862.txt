Robinia pseudoacacia honey is one of the most appreciated and sold honeys on the Romanian market. The study wants to highlight some melisopalinological aspects of Robinia pseudoacacia honeys from some manufacturing companyes that act on the Ia^i commercial market. Depending on the specific pollen granite percent, the quality class can be set, and the possible forgery. The methods used are microscopically analysis on the centrifuged sediment, counting of the determinate pollen grains and nonpollenical impurities. Reporting the pollen grains number to the used honey amount used provides information on the botanical and geographical origins, quality class and purity of the honey. The robinia pollen percentage from the analized samples vary from 12,31% and 52,76,including the honey in all the quality classes for Romania. The nonpollinical impurityes vary from 2627 to 15744 in 10 grams honey. Overprocessing increases the honey quality class, subtracting the impurities but also makes authenticity testing more difficult, makeing this honey easier to forge. In order to have an objective romanain honey quality, a processing and labeling alignment with the european standards is necessary

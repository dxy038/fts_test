An on-off iterative adaptive controller has been developed that is applicable to servo systems performing repeated motions under extremely strict power constraints. The motivation for this approach is the control of piezoelectric actuators in autonomous micro-robots, where power consumption in analog circuitry and/or for position sensing may be much larger than that of the actuators themselves. The control algorithm optimizes the switching instances between `on´ and `off´ inputs to the actuator using a stochastic approximation of the gradient of an objective function, namely that the system reach a specified output value at a specified time. This allows rapid convergence of system output to the desired value using just a single sensor measurement per iteration and discrete voltage inputs.

The objective airborne network (AN) of the future uses a heterogeneous set of physical links (RF, optical/laser, and SATCOM) to interconnect terrestrial, space and highly mobile airborne platforms. The primary communications resources of the network is the air-borne platforms themselves, which self-forms into a network with a dynamic topology - i.e. a mobile ad hoc network. As a war-fighting asset, the objective AN should provide commanders the capability to ascertain the net-work´s operational health and status, i.e. network situational awareness. Additionally, AN communications resources should be configurable to meet the commanders´ operational objectives. These operational requirements are typically satisfied in terrestrial, wire-line networks by network management (NM) capabilities. However, network management of mobile ad hoc networks is an emerging research area facing many challenges. This paper identifies the management challenges of the AN and outlines an architecture to address these challenges. The proposed architecture is then used to frame the critical research and technology needs the military communications community should address to enable network management of the future AN. This paper was invited for the airborne networking session by Kenneth Stranc, session organizer.

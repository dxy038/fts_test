Fuzzy c-means (FCMs) with spatial constraints have been considered as an effective algorithm for image segmentation. The well-known Gaussian mixture model (GMM) has also been regarded as a useful tool in several image segmentation applications. In this study, the authors propose a new algorithm to incorporate the merits of these two approaches and reveal some intrinsic relationships between them. In the authors model, the new objective function pays more attention on spatial constraints and adopts Gaussian distribution as the distance function. Thus, their model can degrade to the standard GMM as a special case. Our algorithm is fully free of the empirically pre-defined parameters that are used in traditional FCM methods to balance between robustness to noise and effectiveness of preserving the image sharpness and details. Furthermore, in their algorithm, the prior probability of an image pixel is influenced by the fuzzy memberships of pixels in its immediate neighbourhood to incorporate the local spatial information and intensity information. Finally, they utilise the mean template instead of the traditional hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model for estimation of prior probability. The mean template is considered as a spatial constraint for collecting more image spatial information. Compared with HMRF, their method is simple, easy and fast to implement. The performance of their proposed algorithm, compared with state-of-the-art technologies including extensions of possibilistic fuzzy c-means (PFCM), GMM, FCM, HMRF and their hybrid models, demonstrates its improved robustness and effectiveness.

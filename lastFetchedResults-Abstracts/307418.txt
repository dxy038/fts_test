Objective
Evaluate anticoagulants influence on blood S100B levels.
Design and methods
Blood from 18 healthy adult subjects were collected using: no anticoagulants; EDTA; heparin; and citrate. S100B levels were determined using LIA-mat assay.
Results
Heparin and citrate increased S100B levels (p< 0.001), whereas EDTA had no effect (p = 0.24). Heparin samples were highly (r2 = 0.97, p< 0.001), citrate samples were moderately (r2 = 0.49, p< 0.001), and EDTA samples were not (r2 = 0.22, p = 0.059) correlated with serum samples.
Conclusion
When anticoagulant is required, heparin should be the primary choice

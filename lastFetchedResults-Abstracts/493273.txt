Background: As application of chemical fertilizers has been recognized to cause pollution soil, water and agricultural products, today bio-fertilizers are an alternative to mineral fertilizers for increasing soil productivity and plant growth in sustainable agriculture.
Objective: To determine the effects of biological and chemical fertilizers on qualitative and quantitative yield of Shirazian Babooneh (Matricaria recutita L.)
Methods: This study was done in a randomized complete block design with three replications and six treatments along 2009- 2010. The treatments were A (Control or no applying fertilizer), B (Bio-fertilizer as Nitroxin+ 53 Kg/ha chemical fertilizer), C (Bio-fertilizer as Super nitro plus + 53 Kg/ha chemical fertilizer), D (Bio-fertilizer as mix of Super nitro plus & Nitroxin + 35 Kg/ha chemical fertilizer), E (Bio-fertilizer as Bio-sulfur) and F (106 Kg/ha chemical fertilizer). 
Results: The fertilizer treatments had significant effects on plant height (p < 0.05), plant dry weight (p < 0.05), capitol diameter (p < 0.01), fresh weight of capitol per ha (p < 0.01), dry weight of capitol per ha (p < 0.05), essential oil yield per ha (p < 0.01), chamazulene content (p < 0.01) and total flavonoid content (p < 0.01). The chemical fertilizer had not significant effect on qualitative and quantitative yield of Shirazian Babooneh and the lowest qualitative and quantitative yield of Shirazian Babooneh was related to control (A) and chemical fertilizer (F) treatments. Although, the application of bio-fertilizers significantly increased the yield in respect of all studied parameters, the highest dry weight of capitol and content of essential oil were observed in biosulfur (E) treatment. 
Conclusion: The application of the bio- fertilizers increased qualitative and quantitative yield of Shirazian Babooneh and Bio-sulfur treatment was the best treatment. Also, the application of the bio- fertilizers can be in order to reduction in application of chemical fertilizers in agro-ecosystem which is attitude toward minimize of environmental pollution and sustainable agriculture.

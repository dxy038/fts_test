In this paper, a low-complexity SDMA-based greedy resource allocation (SGRA) algorithm is proposed for the uplink of IEEE 802.16 MIMO-OFDMA systems taking into account co-channel interference. The objective of SGRA is to allocate resources in the space-time-frequency domain in order to maximize system throughput while guaranteeing QoS requirements of real time services. By performing efficient interference management, SGRA can be carried out in two phases. In the first phase, greedy resource allocation, primarily involving uplink scheduling and subchannel allocation across the MAC and PHY layers, is performed in the time-frequency domain. In the second phase, the resource allocation is extended to the space-time-frequency domain. Simulation results show that SGRA can improve system throughput while at the same time guaranteeing the delay and minimum data rate requirements of users.

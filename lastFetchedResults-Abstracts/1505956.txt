The objective of this study was to assess rural poultry production and management practices in lowland and midland agro-ecological zones of central Tigray in Northern Ethiopia (13 015’ and 14039’ North latitude, and 380 34’ and 39025’ East longitude).  A total of 160 households, 80 from male and 80 from female headed households were selected randomly. All farmers in both agro-ecologies provided supplementary feed and water to their chickens but did not use feed trough, they simply poured the grain on the ground. About 62.5% of the households in midland and 40% in lowland constructed separate poultry house. There was positive correlation (r = 0.48, n=160) between separate housing and flock size.  About 81.25% of the producers in the lowland and 87.5% in the midland selected hens for breeding purpose. Selection and culling of chickens were considered as best traditional breeding practices in both agro-ecologies. About 75% and 87.5% of the male and female headed households in lowland and 92.5% and 82.5% of the male and female headed households in midland, respectively selected hens for breeding purpose using different selection criteria. Culling age of cocks in midland (2.8±0.08 years) was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than in lowland (2.5±0.08 years). About 75% of the male and 50% of the female headed households in lowland and 72.5% of the male and 65% of the female headed households in midland treated their chickens at home traditionally. Different types of treatment methods were used to treat sick chickens and the type of traditional treatment methods used by the households showed significant (X2=92.3; P < 0.001) variation. Diseases, poor veterinary services, below standard housing, poor nutrition and neglecting the local chickens in extension packages are the major constraints of the system but the desire of the farmers to promote poultry production and their indigenous knowledge on culling and selection practice could be an opportunity to improve the sector.

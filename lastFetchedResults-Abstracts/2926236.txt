Saccades are fast movements of the eyes that are used to centre an object of interest on the region of the retina which has the greatest acuity and colour vision (the fovea). Analysis of the dynamics of saccadic eye movements provides a rapid, sensitive and objective measure of the intensity of depressant drug activity in the central nervous system of man (Mercer et al., 1991). A practical system for the measurement of drug action must be able to generate, capture and analyse saccadic eye movements. The author considers how the Cardiff Saccade Generation and Analysis System (CSGAAS) incorporates these elements into a comprehensive computerised system for the routine measurement of drug action in the CNS of man. The aim during development of CSGAAS was to produce a system that was simple enough for use as a routine screen in drug studies but with the flexibility to be a useful research tool

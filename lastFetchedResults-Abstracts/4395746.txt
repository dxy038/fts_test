In this paper, standard normal cloud model is adopted to deal with the randomness and fuzziness of power quality comprehensive assessment indicators, through quantifying qualitative indicators. Taking both the subjective and objective factors into consideration, the improved multi-level interactive decision-making mode is chosen to detemine the weights of different indexes, cosidering the two-way interaction between power supplier and electrical consumers. In this way, cloud model based power quality comprehensive assessment interactive decision-making approach has been established. Through the approach, the correlations between assessment points and cloud model are calculated. The credibility of assessment is defined to make the approach not only a way to express the results, but also a method to evaluate the accuracy, in this paper, the results of one typical case show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

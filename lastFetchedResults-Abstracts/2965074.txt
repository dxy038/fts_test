We consider output regulation for SISO nonlinear plants by gain scheduling on the plant output. The objective of design is to keep the states within prescribed bound from their instantaneous trim values and output asymptotic tracking of reference signal. The controller is constructed using synthesis of chaos and a scheduler monitoring the error between reference signal and the output. The design eliminates the need for scheduling variable to vary slowly yet the feedback system has robust performance and nominal stability

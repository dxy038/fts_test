Focusing on enriched multimedia user created contents (UCC), also
known as user-generated contents, we provide a novel uplink traffic management
scheme which consists on the both of network selection and traffic redistribution. A
recent trend in the use of the multimedia Internet exhibits rapid growth of UCC with
the potential to create a huge amount of uplink traffic for wireless operators. Our
objective is finding the optimal heterogeneous network operation framework under
the precise uplink UCC traffic analysis. We suggest the market-based evaluation of
the relative value of resources for each network, and develop a whole new uplink
UCC operation framework in heterogeneous 3G/4G networks. To prove the applicability
of the proposed operation framework and analysis, we build a large-scale
uplink test-bed system. The test-bed contains all necessary functions of network
facilities and protocols for development of emerging multimedia UCC traffic. We
can easily test the various service scenarios in heterogeneous network environment
by the developed test-bed system

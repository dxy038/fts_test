The present work’s major objective consists in examining the impact of managerial
shareholding on corporate diversification decision. For this sake a theoretical framework
based on the corporate governance contractual approach, has been advanced highlighting the
idea that the executive detaining a certain capital share proportion enjoys a diversification
oriented strategic decision. The reached results, conducted on a sample of 111 Tunisian
commercial companies and service-providing firms, appear to reveal the persistence of an
insignificant impact of the executives’ shareholding on diversification decision.

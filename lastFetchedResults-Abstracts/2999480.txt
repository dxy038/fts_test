This paper targets software engineering education in both graduate and undergraduate courses for power system engineers. Its objective is to provide ideas for improving the level of training of power system engineers in the power system software engineering area. It is stressed that engineers should be trained to have a systematic approach to problem solving. Students should be exposed to software engineering as soon as possible. By developing software and creating problem solution algorithms, students can understand the most complex concepts in the underlying system engineering. It is important to learn about available possibilities and to learn how actual professional tools are created and what are the limitations. It is recommended to significantly increase the usage of software engineering topics in power systems for attracting students.

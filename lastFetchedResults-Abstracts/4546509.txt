There are many demand points of emergency in a large-scale emergency, and the massive emergency commodities are needed. Therefore, many rescuing points of emergency are needed to provide enough emergency commodities. This paper takes the total smallest delayed time and the total smallest cost as goals, established the multi-objective model, studies how to schedule emergency commodities from multi-rescuing points to multi-demand points, gives the algorithm of the model- fuzzy algorithm based on two-dimension distance of western style, and carries on the checking calculation with the example. It will supply a certain guide for the scheduling of commodities in large-scale emergencies.

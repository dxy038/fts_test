The objective is to develop a robust remote measurement calibration (RRMC) method that will be implemented at the control center of a system observed by a redundant collection of remote terminal units (RTUs). The method assumes that the system is balanced, has known parameters, and has known topology. The method involves the field calibration of a minimal set of measurements to calibrate all the measurements of the system.

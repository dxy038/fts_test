Considering gradually increase of wind turbine (WT) penetration and the reactive regulating capability of WT which is not fully utilized, this paper studies comprehensive configuration of different types of WT and switch capacity (SC). In order to account the time-sequence characteristic and randomness of load and natural resources, multi-state model is established. Bi-level Programming model adopting chance constrained programming is proposed, which considers reactive regulating ability of WT during operation. The model takes the minimum annual cost above the confidence level as the upper level planning objective function, the minimum network loss above the confidence level as lower level planning objective function. Immune-Genetic Algorithm with Elitist and adaptive PSO are applied for solving model. The simulation results show that optimal configuration of WT and SC can improve investment effectiveness of distribution network, and doubly-fed induction wind turbine is more efficient while direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous wind turbine has broad prospects.

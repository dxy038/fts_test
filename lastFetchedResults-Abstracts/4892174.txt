The purpose of room impulse response reshaping is usually to reduce reverberation and thus to improve the perceived quality of the received signal by prefiltering the source signal before it is played with a loudspeaker in a closed room or by postfiltering the recorded microphone signal. The utilization of an infinity- and/or p-norm based objective function in the time domain has shown to be quite effective compared to least-squares approaches. Although this method intrinsically favors solutions with flat overall frequency responses, in some cases noticeable spectral distortion may occur. In this contribution we propose a method to jointly optimize infinity- and/or p-norm based objective functions in the time and frequency domains to achieve a good reshaping while not affecting the perceived quality due to spectral distortions.

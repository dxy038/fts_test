The development of the ITER “The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor”, whose objective is to produce energy and to test the tritium self-sufficiency for future fusion reactors, has promote the study of Pb–Li eutectic alloy. This alloy has been selected for the manufacture of HCLL (Helium Cooled Lithium Lead) – TBM (Test Blanket Modules). However, during the manufacturing process of the Pb–Li alloys, a loss of Li occurs and the formation of eutectic structures is inhibited. The present paper analyses the melting from Pb and pure Li, to obtain Pb–Li with 17 at.% in Li (eutectic alloy). For this purpose, different parameters to control the process were evaluated, such as temperature, period of melting and at.% in Li. Cast alloys were characterized analytically and microstructurally, which implies the determination of the compositional distribution of Li in the ingot and the phases and the microsegregation involved. The work presents the optimal conditions for the melting process as selected output for the production of Pb–Li eutectic alloys.

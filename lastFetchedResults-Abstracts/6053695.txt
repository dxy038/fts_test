In cloud computing era, datacenter can be organized by resources distributed geographically on demand into a dynamic logical entity. All these virtualized datacenters (VDCs) migrate transparently to another resources set for the best cost-effectiveness. Open storage architecture is one of the basic infrastructures in Cloud. This paper introduces a scheduling model of access request in open storage architectures. This scheduler runs during the migration of VDCs. We discuss the environment model and scheduling criteria in detail. And then we propose the objective functions and the scheduling function Q. In this model, all components including users, VDCs, and scheduler cooperates with each other via associative broadcast. We expect that this proposed scheduler will be used in nowadays cloud computing environment and provide the ability of multiobjective optimization scheduling in the future.

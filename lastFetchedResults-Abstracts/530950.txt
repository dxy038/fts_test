Background: Monitoring of phenotypic characteristics of T-lymphocytes in peripheral blood is commonly performed to give the clinical parameters in the management of kidney transplant recipients. Objective: To predict rejection in renal transplantation by immune parameters. Methods: 16 non-diabetic kidney transplant candidates (4 females and 12 males, age = 20-65 yr, first time transplant) were selected. The transplanted patients were divided into two groups based on the rejection during 3 weeks post transplant: group I (n = 9) without rejection and group II (n = 7) with a rejection episode. Immune parameters including lymphocytes subpopulations (by flowcytometry) and immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgG, IgA and IgE by nephlometric assay) before and 45 days after transplantation were determined. Results: The results of this investigation showed that the level of immunoglobulin IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE decreased post transplantation due to immunosuppressive drugs. CD3, CD4, CD8 T cells count, CD56 NK cells count and CD20 B cells count pre- and post-transplantation did not show any significant differences. The amount of IgE (220 vs. 462 IU/ml), CD3 (62% vs. 69.7%) and CD4 (35% vs. 41.3%) cells increased in group II during rejection episode pre-transplantation. In addition, IgA increased pretransplantation in group I those without rejection episode in comparison with group II with a rejection episode. Forty five days post transplantation IgA (209 vs. 152 mg/dl), IgG (1009 vs. 703 mg/dl) and CD20 (15% vs. 10%) increased in group I patients. Conclusion: It is suggestive that pre-transplantation increases IgE, CD3 and CD4 are predictive of acute rejection

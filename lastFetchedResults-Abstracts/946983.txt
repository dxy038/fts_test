Objective: To compare the memory of children with learning disabilities in dictation, mathematics and reading skills with normal children in fourth grade primary schools in Isfahan. Method: For this purpose, 60 students in 4 groups (15 normal students, 15 students with writing disorder, 15 students with dyscalculia, and 15 students with dyslexia) were selected randomly. The memory subscale of Wechsler Intelligence Scale was administered to the subjects to measure their memory. Data were analyzed using Tukeyâ€™s test and analysis of variance. Results: The results showed that there is significant difference between the memory of normal children and that of children with dyslexia, dyscalculia, and writing disorder. Conclusion: The memory of children with learning disabilities is significantly problematic; and schoolchildren with writing disorder have weaker memories compared to the other two groups.

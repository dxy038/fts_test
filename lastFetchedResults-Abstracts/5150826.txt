A fundamental objective in the design of resonant tunneling diodes for microwave oscillators and digital switching is the achievement of the highest possible peak current density at the lowest possible peak voltage, while maintaining a high peak-to-valley current ratio and wide valley region. It is demonstrated that by combining very thin AlAs barriers with relatively wide InAs wells, within bounding regions of InGaAs lattice-matched to InP, it is possible to achieve room-temperature peak current densities in excess of 450 kA/cm/sup 2/, the highest ever reported for resonant tunneling diodes, at peak voltages as low as 0.7 V. The corresponding peak-to-valley current ratio is approximately 3.6. By working within the InGaAlAs quaternary system, the device designer has a great deal of flexibility and latitude in sculpturing the device structure to optimize a number of specific performance characteristics.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

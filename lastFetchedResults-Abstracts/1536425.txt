The main objective of this study is to investigate and control the chaotic behaviour of fractional-order Coullet system, including the necessary condition for appearance of chaos. An active control technique, in a masterâ€“slave structure for synchronization is suggested to control this chaotic system. The stability condition is obtained in both of theoretical analysis and simulation manner. The numerical simulation verifies the performance of the proposed controller.

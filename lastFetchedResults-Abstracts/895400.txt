Objective: %10-15 of couples are infertile and suffer from psychological problems. Comparison of stress, anxiety and depression levels in first, second and third trimesters between women with normal pregnancy and pregnant women who have received infertility treatment, is the main aim of this study.
Method: In this cross-sectional study 267 persons (137 pregnant women who have received infertility treatment and 130 women with
normal pregnancy) were studied with Causal-Inferential by DASS-42 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-42 questions). Mann-Whitney U
and Kruskal-Wallis-H were used for statistical analysis.
Results: The levels of anxiety and stress in pregnant women who have received infertility treatment were significantly more than women with normal pregnancy at first and second trimesters but there was no statistically significant difference between trimesters of both groups in depression.
Conclusion: The psychological problems that infertile women suffer from, before pregnancy, and uncertainty about the outcome of infertility treatment could be the cause of arising levels of depression, anxiety and stress during pregnancy comparing with control group. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that women with infertility history should receive routine and supportive psychological counseling during pregnancy.

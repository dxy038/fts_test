The objective of this paper is to study the feasibility of broadband technologies for substation monitoring in an effective manner and to develop a simplified transfer characteristic model for the low voltage indoor power line for Broadband power line communication based on the transmission line theory using software simulation for generalization purpose as it is already known that there is no such thing as a standard ldquopower line networkrdquo. A bottom-up approach based on the frequency-domain modeling and using scattering matrix is implemented for channel modeling in this paper.

In recent years, with the rapid growth of the Internet, the user scheduling a travel can make own schedule not only using the package tour that a travel agency offers but also searching for the information about the travel spot that oneself wants to go. However, it is not easy for a user to search for the information about the destination and to collect it. It is more difficult to use obtained barrage of information and to make a schedule effectively. Therefore, without time and effort, it is very effective to make a schedule from the first image and interest for the destination. In this paper, we propose a system which makes a travel schedule by using the first image and interest for a destination as input data, without searching for the detailed information about the destination. In our proposed system, a schedule is made based on a time evaluation value and a spot evaluation value, which is calculated according to a subjective evaluation value and an objective evaluation value. On a selection screen displayed based on the schedule tree, the user can decide a schedule by selecting a spot which wants to go in sequence. As a prototype of our system, we implemented it for OKINAWA tour.

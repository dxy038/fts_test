The objective of the research was to explore the impact of air pollution on the health of human respiratory system. The method of the study was to collect data of Air Pollution Index (API), meteorology and the hospitalization of respiratory from 2004 to 2007 in urban of Lanzhou,China. The impact of the air pollution on the health of respiratory was investigated Generalized Additive Poisson models after controlling long-term time trend, week and meteorology, and stratified by gender, age and respiratory disease type. The result of the study is that every one of IQR (48 units) rising in daily API, there was a 5.50 (95%CI: 4.03%, 6.99%) increase in respiratory hospitalizations, and this influence was delayed effects.Males are more susceptible than females to air pollution and air pollution is more likely to affect under 15-years-old and over 65-years-old. As well as the delayed effects of API rising to pneumonia patients is higher than upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). The conclusion of the study is that air pollution considerably affects urban residentsÂ´ respiratory morbidity, and gender, age and respiratory disease type had different effects.

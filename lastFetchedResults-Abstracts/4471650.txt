The primary objective of this pilot project was to investigate the effectiveness Interactive Surrogate Travel (heretofore referred to as IST) in psychiatric testing involving culture-sensitive symptoms. Assuming that IST will soon become available for various clinical applications, this investigates may shed light on this important technology. High speed computing has drastically improved image processing in various forms. Furthermore, cost and size reductions have made it possible to process 3-D images using personal computers by simply adding an image-processing board to the computer. In this pilot trial, a CAVE system was used to display three-dimensional images.

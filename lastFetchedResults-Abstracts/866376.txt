In this paper, we formulate an optimal design of system reliability problem as a nonlinear integer programming problem with interval coefficients, transform it into a single objective nonlinear integer programming problem without interval coefficients, and solve it directly with keeping nonlinearity of the objective function by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). Also, we demonstrate the efficiency of this method with incomplete Fault Detecting and Switching (FDS) for allocating redundant units.

With wireless energy transfer capability, network nodes can rely on the energy supplied wirelessly from a network hub or access point. As a result, there is no need for the nodes to replace or recharge their battery using any wire. This paper considers such a scenario and proposes the performance analysis and optimization framework for the network operating on a TDMA protocol with wireless energy transfer. We first present the analysis and optimization of an individual node in the network. The objective is to maximize the network utility defined in terms of throughput and the number of packets in the queue such that the packet loss probability is maintained below the threshold. We solve the optimization problem to obtain an optimal policy to operate the node (i.e, to be active or inactive). We next formulate the network optimization problem for the network hub. The problem can be solved to determine the amount of wireless energy transfer to meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements of all the nodes in the network. We reveal the special structure of the problem, that we can decompose the network optimization into small subproblems. These subproblems can be solved efficiently using the standard algorithm.

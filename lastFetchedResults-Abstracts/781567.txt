The objective was to look for the promising tree leaves, for feeding to livestock. The preliminary screening of tree leaves (nine
species) by in vitro gas production technique revealed that leaves of Azadirachta indica, Melia azedarach, Morus alba and Leucaena
leucocephala could serve as promising, alternate feed resource for ruminants. Therefore, in vivo evaluation of these tree leaves
(except A. indica) along with that of Toona ciliate was assessed. Each species of the fresh tree leaves, supplemented with mineral
mixture and common salt, was offered ad lib as complete feed to three bucks (Beetle×Anglo Nubian×French Alpine; 6 years old
of 56.7±1.12 kg BW). The data were analyzed by using completely randomized design. Bucks relished all the tree leaves (except
T. ciliate) as indicated by higher (P < 0.05) voluntary DM intake and digestibility of nutrients. All the animals were in positive
N-balance except those fed Toona ciliate. The N-retention was maximum in animals fed M. alba followed by that in L. leucocephala
and M. azedarach. However, the DCP content of M. alba, M. azedarach and L. leucocephala was statistically comparable, while
ME availability was higher (P < 0.05) from leaves of M. azedarach followed by that of M. alba, clearly indicated that leaves of M.
azedarach, M. alba or L. leucocephala, supplemented with mineral mixture and common salt, could serve as an excellent complete
feed for small ruminants.

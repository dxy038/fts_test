In this paper, a novel code selected M-ary direct sequence ultra wideband communication system is introduced. The objective is to get a high data rate UWB system by using the M-ary coded selected direct sequence bipolar pulse amplitude modulation (MCSDS-BPAM) scheme. In this system, a particular DS code sequence can be selected by the log<sub>2</sub>(M/2) bits from the DS code set. This scheme can obtain high data rate without increasing the system bandwidth or changing the pulse shape. With the increase of the modulation level M, the system bit error rate (BER) will be improved for the same signal energy per bit. The simulation results are provided in the condition of AWGN channel and correlation receivers.

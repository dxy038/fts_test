Efficiently compressing 3D multi-view video, while maintaining a high quality of received 3D video, is very challenging. Error Concealment (EC) algorithms have the advantage of improving the received video quality without modifications in the transmission rate or in the encoder hardware or software. To improve the quality of reconstructed 3D multi-view video, we propose different algorithms to conceal the erroneous and lost blocks of intra-coded and inter-coded frames by exploiting the spatial, temporal and inter-view correlations between frames and views. A hybrid of Space Domain Error Concealment (SDEC) and Time Domain Error Concealment (TDEC) is introduced for concealment of intra-frames errors. Three EC modes are introduced for inter-frames, which are Time Domain Error Concealment (TDEC), Inter-view Domain Error Concealment (IVDEC) and joint Time and Interview Domain Error Concealment (TIVDEC). Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can significantly improve the objective and subjective quality of reconstructed 3D multi-view video sequences.

The objective of this work was to study the color, opacity, crystallinity, and the thermal and mechanical properties of films based on blends of gelatin and five different types of PVA [poly(vinyl alcohol)], with and without a plasticizer. The effect of the degree of hydrolysis of the PVA and the glycerol concentration on these properties was studied using colorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and tensile mechanical tests. All films were essentially colorless (ΔE∗ < 5) and with low opacity (Y ⩽ 2.1). The DSC results were typical of partially crystalline materials, showing some phase separation characterized by a glass transition (Tg = 40–55 °C), related to the amorphous part of the material, followed by two endothermic peaks related to the melting (Tm = 100–160 and 170–210 °C) of the crystallites. The XRD results confirmed the crystallinity of the films. The film produced with PVA Celvol® 418 (DH = 91.8%) showed the highest tensile resistance (tensile strength = 38 MPa), for films without plasticizer. However, with glycerol, the above-mentioned PVA and the PVA Celvol® 504 produced the least resistant films of all the PVA types. But, although the mechanical properties of the blended films depended on the type of PVA used, there was no direct relationship between these properties and the degree of hydrolysis of the PVA. The properties studied were more closely dependent on the glycerol concentration. Finally, the mechanical resistance of the films presented a linear relationship with the glass transition temperature of the films.

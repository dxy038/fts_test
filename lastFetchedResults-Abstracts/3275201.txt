The oil and gas industry has a strong demand of subsea knowledge in order to determine seafloor characteristics, to provide secure installation of underwater structures, to check its conditions, among others. In this context, acoustic methods have been providing essential information. In the study case presented here, a multibeam system was used for pipeline inspection at two different water depths and the results obtained allowed the discussion on how acoustic changes on the signal can affect what is observed from the survey. The main objective is to emphasize the relevance of understanding the needs of the offshore industry, the capabilities of the equipment available and its limitations aiming to take the most of it.

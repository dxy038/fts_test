In this paper, a systematic method is proposed for the design of general multivariable controller for complex processes to achieve
the goal of fast loop responses with acceptable overshoots and minimum loop interaction while maintaining low complexity of the
feedback controller. The design of general transfer function type controller is based on the fundamental relations under decoupling
of a multivariable process, and the characterization of the unavoidable time delays and non-minimum phase zeros that are inherent
in the decoupled loops. The objective loop transfer functions are then suitably specified to achieve fast loop response taking into
account the performance limitation imposed by those non-minimum phase zeros and time delays. The ideal controller is then
obtained which is in general a complicated irrational transfer matrix, for which model reduction with recursive least squares is
applied in the frequency domain to obtain a much simpler transfer matrix with its elements in the form of rational transfer function
plus delay. Simulations show that very satisfactory control performance is achieved.

Magnetization of activated carbon is an effective approach to separate and recover the spent activated carbon. Recently, synthesis of magnetic activated carbon has become a research focus in the fields of environment. The main objective of this study is to list and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different methods to preparation of magnetic activated carbons (MAC). These methods have been categorized into five: bonding, impregnation, ball milling, chemical coprecipitation and one-step synthetic method. The use of MAC can be applied in various aqueous treatment processes, namely to remove organic pollutants, dyes, and heavy metals. Conclusions have been drawn from the literature reviewed, and suggestions for future research are proposed.

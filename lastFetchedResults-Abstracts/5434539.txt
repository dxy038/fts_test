This paper presents a novel particle swarm optimization based approach to optimally incorporate a distribution generator into a distribution system. The proposed algorithm combines particle swarm optimization with load flow algorithm to solve the problem in a single step, i.e. finding the best combination of location and size simultaneously. In the developed algorithm, the objective function to be minimized is the total network power losses while satisfying the voltage constraints imposed on the system. It is formulated as constrained mixed integer nonlinear programming problem with the location being discrete. The 69 bus radial distribution system has been used to validate the proposed method. Test results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the developed algorithm.

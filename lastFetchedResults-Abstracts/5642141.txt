Though based on rigorously developed ideas from imaging geometry, viewpoint evaluation in the active area of camera placement planning research still relies on the intuition and creativity of researchers for the formulation of objective measures. In this paper, a comparative study of five different viewpoint evaluation functions is presented. All five functions are based on a similar set of imaging requirements and considerations but each is unique in its formulation, and in some cases, in its objective. Functional behaviour and performance for the vision task of model-based inspectional coverage are studied quantitatively and qualitatively.

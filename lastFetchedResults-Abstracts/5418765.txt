The static analysis and the modal analysis of a tower crane structure were completed. To improve the dynamic performance of tower crane, the key modal frequencies were taken as the optimization objective. Sensitivity analysis was done for structural parameters to decide the dynamic optimum design variables. The constraints to the model included the mass, strengths and stiffness of the structure. Then the dynamic optimum design of tower crane structure was performed by finite element analysis (FEA) software ANSYS. The optimization design of the structure was obtained accordingly. The optimum result showed that the dynamic property of tower crane is improved effectively, and the comprehensive performance of the structure is strengthened.

This paper tries to solve a multi objective
optimal capacitor placement problem, considering system
unbalancing as well as the harmonic distorted nature of
distribution systems using Non-dominated Sorting
Genetic Algorithm (NSGA). By using NSGA,
relationship between various components of objective
functions, such as total installed capacitors, system
unbalancing index and total harmonic distortion level can
be obtained clearly. This would result in helpful
information that can be utilized to make a reasonable
decision on the best tradeoffs between capacitor
placement cost, system unbalancing and harmonic
distortion level of system. The proposed (NSGA)-based
approach is tested on an IEEE 37-bus radial distribution
system. The findings clearly demonstrate the necessity of
including harmonics in optimal capacitor placement to
avoid any possible problems associated with harmonics.

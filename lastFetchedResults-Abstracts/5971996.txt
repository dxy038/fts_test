TTCAN protocol reduces the jitter of message and makes full use of bandwidth by introducing time-trigger mode into CAN bus. On the other hand it reduces the reliability under electromagnetic interference (EMI). Conclusion is drawn that the performance and reliability canpsilat get the minimum value simultaneously in this paper. In order to improve the reliability of TTCAN bus under EMI, Generic Algorithms are used in the schedule of TTCAN which is a NP hard problem. Because of the unique property of schedule of TTCAN, coding, objective and fitness function, and mutation are investigated and developed to meet the requirement of optimization problem for reliability. The experiment is carried out based on the SAE benchmark and the result shows the validity of the above algorithm.

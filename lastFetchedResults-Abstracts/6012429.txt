The main objective of this paper is to numerically investigate the effects of a divert jet on the overall aerodynamic performance of a generic interceptor missile operating at moderate angle attack. A generic missile interceptor configuration consisting of a long, slender body containing tail fins is simulated in this study. Firstly, K-epsiv, K-omega and S-A turbulent model are evaluated in simulating downstream vortex transmission, the results show the K-epsiv has good ability in capturing vortex structure, especially secondary vortex structure. Secondly, by employing K-epsiv turbulent model, three dimensional computations of the highly turbulent flow field produced by five pulsed, supersonic, lateral jet control thrusters interaction with the supersonic free stream and missile boundary layer of the generic interceptor missile at 10 km for the Mach number is 3.0 and 6.0 is simulated. Finally, normal force and moment as well as normal force and moment amplification factor is assessed by integrating the surface pressures and viscous shear stresses computed on the missile surfaces. These results are used to determine the Mach number influence on the interaction of transient jet and supersonic aerodynamic performed missile. The analysis predicts strong influences for the integrated normal force and moment.

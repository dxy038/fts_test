Objective The aim of this study was to determine
the mortality by suicide and other causes of death
in a cohort of suicide attempters and identify predictive
factors,including contact to healthcare after the attempt.
Method All consecutive 1198 deliberate self-harm patients
treated in hospital emergency rooms in Helsinki
during a 12-month period were identified. Data were
gathered on healthcare contacts preceding and following
the index attempt, and cause-specific mortality over a 5-
year period.ResultsBy the end of the 5-year follow-up period,
171 (14%) of the patients had died. A total of 57
(5 %) had committed suicide. The age- and sex-adjusted
risk for suicide among deliberate self-harm patients was
40-fold, and for death overall tenfold, compared to general
population during the 5-year follow-up period.Risk
factors for subsequent suicide were a diagnosis of substance
use disorder,male gender and previous suicide attempts.
A diagnosis of substance use disorder and male
gender predicted death. Furthermore, male gender and
substance use disorders had a strong interaction for both
classes of death. Conclusions The findings of this study
suggest that deliberate self-harm patients have a high
risk for both suicide and other causes of death.Male gender
and substance use disorders are significant risk factors
for both later suicide and other causes of death.Male
suicide attempters with substance use disorders have remarkably
high total and suicide mortality.

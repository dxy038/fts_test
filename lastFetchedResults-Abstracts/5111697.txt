It is widely recognized that the hybrid fiber/coax (HFC) network can support bidirectional communication service. In this paper, a media-access control (MAC) protocol for telephony on HFC network is introduced. We describe the principles of the MAC protocol operation and analyze the structure of the call control primitives, it is shown that the protocol can support other synchronous transfer mode (STM) services which are based on DS0

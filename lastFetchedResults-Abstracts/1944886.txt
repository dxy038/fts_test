The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships between 16 process variables of the CMP tower chemi-mechanical pulp, and 17 newsprint quality properties at Mazandaran Wood and Paper Industries and to develop predictive models. After preparation of suitable data series considering the time needed for pulp to paper, the relations between process dependant and newsprint independent variables were determined using partial least squares (PLS) regression. In result, 4 calculated latent vectors could categorize and relate variables. The first vector as the most important factor, determined about 50 percent changes of 7 newsprint properties including; Caliper, Bulk, Breaking Length MD, Elongation MD, Burst, Opacity and Air Resistance. The amount of fibers remained on the +48 mesh screens including long fiber fractions, was the most influencing variable on the above 7 newsprint properties. To predict the newsprint properties, after reduction of model dimensions, reduced rank regression method were used that in result the changes in paper caliper, bulk, breaking length MD, burst and, opacity were determined as much as 48.7, 49.2, 45.3, 51.5 and, 52.4 percent respectively by CMP tower process variables.Â

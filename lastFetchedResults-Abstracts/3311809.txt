Considering the randomness of photovoltaic (PV) output and load, the paper proposes a new method to analyze PV power penetration limit based on probabilistically optimal power flow. The proposed model based on chance constrained programming, is a nonlinear programming model with multi-constraints which has random variables. It takes the maximal PV power capacity that can be accepted by power grid as objective function, takes power flow equations, secure operation of power grid and particularly static voltage stability margin as constraints. According to the characteristics of the problem, stochastic simulation technique and particle swarm optimization algorithm are applied. The method is analyzed on the IEEE-30 system, the results show that the proposed model is suitable for calculating PV capacity limit considering the randomness of PV output and load, also the results demonstrate the accuracy and conciseness of the model, which can be available for the planning of PV power station.

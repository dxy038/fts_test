Objective: Amino acid alignment analysis of deduced amino acid residues revealed a tripeptide
(SKI) at the carboxy terminus of peroxisomal protein eDNA. In order to see the importance
of the above sorting signal, we have performed a site-directed mutagenesis to delete
SKI tripeptide and its transfection into CHO-K1 and P19 cells .
Materials and Methods: In order to create the appropriate site-directed mutant, PCR was
done with specific primers. Amplified PeP cDNAs either containing SKI or deleted ones were
constructed downstream of EGFP eDNA under regulation of the cytomegalovirus (CMV)
promoter in a pEGFP-C1 vector. Transfection of P19 and CHO cells was done with lipofectamine2000.
Results: Gradient PCR showed that the best annealing temperature was 71.6 "C. Transfection
of plasmids containing chimera of EGFP-PEP cDNAs into the CHO-K1 and P19 cells
showed several punctuate structures, presumably peroxisomes, while SKI deletion showed
a cytosolic mislocalization of the EGFP pattern.
Conclusion: Taken together, these data strongly suggest that SKI, which is located at the
C- terminus of the protein, is required for sorting this protein

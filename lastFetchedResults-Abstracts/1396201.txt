A new approach to process optimal design in non-steady forming of porous metals is presented. In this approach, the optimal design problem involving diverse objective functions and design variables is formulated on the basis of the finite element process model, and a derivative-based approach is adopted as the solution technique. The process model, the formulation for process optimal design, the schemes for the evaluation of the design sensitivity, and an iterative procedure for optimization are described in detail. The validity of the schemes for the evaluation of the design sensitivity is examined by performing a series of numerical tests. The capability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through application to a selected design problem.

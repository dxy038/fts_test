Objective(s): The wide scale use of Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) in the consumer market world makes human beings more prone to the exposure to ZnO nanoparticles and its adverse effects. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to assess renal toxicity potential of ZnO and Polyethylene glycol Coated ZnO Nanoparticles in rat.Materials and Methods: Co-precipitation chemical method was used in order to synthesize ZnO nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles were coated with PEG (Polyethylene glycol) and the coating interactions were investigated by FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). Structural properties of ZnO NPs were evaluated by TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) and XRD (X Ray Diffraction). Toxicity assessment of ZnO and PEG coated ZnO nanoparticles were studied in rat by intra peritoneal injections during a one-month. Renal factors (Creatinine, Uric acid and Blood Urea Nitrogen) were measured 15 and 30 days post injection.Results: The synthesized nanoparticles were single phase and have spinel structure. Their size distribution was around 18 nm. Some kidney factors were changed due to the injection of both uncoated and coated nanoparticles (especially in groups received concentrations of more than 100 mg per kg of body weight). Renal factors changes were more considerable in groups received ZnO NPs in comparison with those received PEG coated ZnO NPs. Chemical toxicity studies showed that there was no irreversible effect in the groups receivedÂ  concentrations less than 200 mg/kg (mg per kg of body weight).Conclusion: The results indicated that renal factors were changed during 15 days post injection, especially in groups received high doses (200 mg/kg). The results of measurements 30 days post injection showed less change in comparison with the control and this indicates that there was no irreversible effect on kidney. Moreover, PEG coated nanoparticles were less toxic in comparison with Uncoated ZnO NPs.

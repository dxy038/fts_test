Cirrus clouds are known to play a key role in the EarthÂ´s radiation budget and global climate change, the radiative effects of cirrus clouds depend critically on cloud properties such as optical thickness and particle shape and size. The studies of the optical, microphysical, and physical properties of cirrus have become the popular issue. This paper simulated the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and bidirectional polarization reflectance distribution function (BPDF) at 1380 nm in cirrus cloudy conditions on the basis of an adding-doubling radiative transfer program. Based on the sensitivity of 1380 nm spectral reflectance and polarization reflectance on cirrus optical thickness and aspect ratio, a conceptual approach has been developed to simultaneous retrieve the particle shape and optical thickness of cirrus clouds using the remote sensing data of multi-angular total and polarized at 1380 nm.

Bidirectional eight-channel wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) systems with multiple repeaters including a fluoride-based erbium doped fiber amplifier (F-EDFA) are investigated. A straight line configuration is used for the transmission line containing the single repeater amplifier, and a recirculating loop configuration is employed for the other experiments

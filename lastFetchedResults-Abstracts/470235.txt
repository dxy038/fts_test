Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine obstetrics and gynecology residents' self-assessment of proficiency on a variety of surgical bench procedures and to compare their ratings with those ratings of trained faculty observers who used instruments that have been shown to be reliable and valid.
Study design
As part of a 6-station Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills, 74 residents at 5 institutions estimated their overall open and laparoscopic skill level before the testing. After completing each station, residents evaluated their overall and global skills performance.
Results
Residents rated their proficiency higher on open skills than on laparoscopic skills. Task-specific, overall, and global assessments were correlated significantly with the faculty ratings (P< .001). Residents tended to rate themselves lower than did faculty on almost all measures; even those residents with poor skills indicated that they were aware of their deficiencies. Overall and global self-assessments increased with each resident level, which indicated good construct validity.
Conclusion
Residents can rate their overall open and laparoscopic skills, task-specific performance, and global skills with good reliability and validity. Although they tended to score themselves lower than did faculty observers, the correlations are high (ie, residents who give themselves a higher score tended to receive a higher score from faculty, and vice versa). One of the concerns about self-assessment is that residents with poor skills might not be aware of their deficiencies. We did not find that to be the case. Therefore, when residents work on self-directed exercises, task-specific and global checklists can be used for both learning and self-assessment.

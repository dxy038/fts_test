OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic utility of the Gram stain, the amniotic fluid glucose level, and the ratio of amniotic fluid glucose level to serum glucose level in detecting intra-amniotic infection.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study of 127 patients with preterm labor and 26 patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes (153 total). All patients underwent amniocentesis to diagnose intra-amniotic infection. The diagnostic criterion for intra-amniotic infection was a positive amniotic fluid culture result.
RESULTS: The Gram stain is 80% sensitive and 91% specific when a positive is considered the presence of white blood cells or bacteria. Amniotic fluid glucose level and the ratio of amniotic fluid glucose level to serum glucose level are significantly lower when amniotic fluid culture results are positive, but as diagnostic tests they are inferior to the Gram stain. Logistic regression models that combine predictors yield superior accuracy with respect to individual tests. The most accurate combination was amniotic fluid glucose level and Gram stain with white blood cells or bacteria. Although the number of patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes was small in this study (n = 26), analysis of our data suggests that the diagnostic performance levels of these tests were similar when used in patients with preterm labor and intact membranes and in patients with premature rupture of the membranes.
CONCLUSIONS: The amniotic fluid glucose level and the ratio of amniotic fluid to serum glucose level have equivalent diagnostic utility and are inferior to the Gram stain. The combination of Gram stain with amniotic fluid glucose level is superior to any individual test. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:650-6.)

It is necessary to perform the energy saving retrofit for existing building to achieve the objective of building energy saving and emission reduction. This paper introduces the energy consumption of Shanghai Maritime University Natatorium, cold and heat source set, air-conditioning water system, air conditioning duct systems, ventilation systems and water circulation system of the status quo. By analyzing the exiting problems of natatorium, this paper discusses several feasible methods on energy saving. Including the change of heat insulation and pool deck stamped insulation film. With the comparation of the running costs of reconstruction and analysis of the heat source configuration, this paper gives the transformation of the basic operating strategies and system diagrams, analyzes the economic benefits of the transformation.

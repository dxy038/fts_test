Objective: The time courses of quadratic phase-coupling (QPC) of electroencephalographic burst and interburst patterns of the ‘trace alternant’ (TA) in full-term newborns have been quantified.
Methods: Using the Gabor expansion, a fast Fourier transformation based method, biamplitude, bicoherence and phase-bicoherence time courses of both burst and interburst patterns have been determined (common average reference EEG recordings). With a frequency resolution of 0.25 Hz and a frequency grid of 1–1.5 3.5–4.5 Hz (region-of-interest), a number of 15 frequency pairs result. These pairs have been investigated.
Results: The burst and the interburst patterns are characterized by temporally and topographically different QPC profiles. All differences are dominant at the electrode Fp1 followed by Fp2. There is a significant difference (combined multiple and global test strategy) in the QPC characteristics between both patterns within the time period from 0.75 to 1.5 s after the pattern onset at electrode Fp1. The maximal QPC in burst patterns (especially at Fp1) can be observed during this time period. In contrast to this finding, maximal QPC in interburst patterns (at Fp1) are reached immediately after the onset and at 3 s. Summarising all findings, a QPC-rhythm of 0.1 Hz during TA can be assumed.
Conclusions: It can be assumed that the QPC rhythm of the TA is generated by a pattern-spanning time-variant phase-locking process and there are indications for a possible correspondence between the QPC rhythm and vegetative rhythms.
Significance: This study showed that advanced, time-variant analysis methods quantifying QPC rhythms are able to add new scientific information to the understanding of nature, characteristics and significance of TA in the neonatal EEG.

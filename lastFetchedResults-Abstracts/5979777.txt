This paper presents a novel method for fast and quantified estimation of the video quality for H.264 video content. Taking into account the instant video quality variation due to the video dynamics within a given H.264 encoded content, this paper introduces the Mean PQoS as a function of the video encoding rate and the picture resolution, and exploits it as a metric for objective video quality assessment. Based on the proposed metric, the paper presents a novel method for pre-encoding video quality prediction.

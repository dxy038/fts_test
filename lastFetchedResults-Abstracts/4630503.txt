The objective of this paper is to present a new learning design framework to enhance learning resources reusability through content discovery, revision, and verification. Our learning design framework can help instructors to design their instructional/learning resources by reusing existing learning design documents and components rather than starting from scratch. Our framework provides a learning design finder in order to help instructors to locate learning design documents matching their instruction needs. If an exactly matched learning design document can be found, then the instructors can directly reuse the matched learning design document. If only partially matched learning design document can be found, then our framework provides a learning design composer to guide instructors to compose a new learning design document to fit instructorsÂ´ needs. The newly found and modified learning design documents will be verified based on IMS learning design speciation rules before they can be fully reused.

In this paper, we present a new class of decoders for low density parity check (LDPC) codes. We are motivated by the observation that the linear programming (LP) decoder has worse error performance than belief propagation (BP) decoders at low SNRs. We base our new decoders on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) decomposition technique for LP decoding. The ADMM not only efficiently solves the LP decoding problem, but also makes it possible to explore other decoding algorithms. In particular, we add various penalty terms to the linear objective of LP decoding with the goal of suppressing pseudocodewords. Simulation results show that the new decoders achieve much better error performance compared to LP decoder at low SNRs. What is more, similar to the LP decoder, no error floor is observed at high SNRs.

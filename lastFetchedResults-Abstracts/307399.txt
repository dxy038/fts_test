Objective
Evaluate anticoagulants influence on plasma S100B levels.
Design and methods
Blood were collected from 18 healthy adult subjects using: no anticoagulants, EDTA, heparin, and citrate. S100B levels were determined using LIA-mat assay.
Results
Heparin plasma and citrate increased plasma S100B levels (p< 0.001), whereas EDTA had no effect (p = 0.24). Heparin plasma samples were highly (r2 = 0.97, p< 0.001), citrate samples were moderately (r2 = 0.49, p< 0.001), and EDTA samples were not (r2 = 0.22, p = 0.059) correlated with serum samples.
Conclusion
When anticoagulant is required, heparin plasma should be the primary choice for measurement of S100 B levels.

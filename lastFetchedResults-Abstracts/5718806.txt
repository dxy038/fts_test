This paper discusses human weight perception using a haptic device. The objective of this study is to reveal the characteristics in human force sensations, which are difficult to examine in a real environment. Further, we aim to apply the perceptual mechanisms to multimedia applications as the final target. In this study, we particularly examine the weight discriminative powers for various weight changes. Expanding our previous study, we compare the difference thresholds for the weight addition and removal during a goal-directed lifting. A statistical analysis implies that our weight discriminative power for the weight addition tends to improve in the deceleration process. As for the weight removal, the weight discriminative power declines in the deceleration process due to the inertia effect in the vicinity of the target height. In addition, this study tries to reveal the weight perception when the load force is gradually changed. The result implies that the time variation in the load force holds the tremendous potential to enable us to experience attractive force sensations and haptic illusions.

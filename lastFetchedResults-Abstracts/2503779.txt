Background: The intensity and duration of speech diffi culty inherently associated with lingual
therapy is a signifi cant issue of concern in orthodontics. This study was designed to evaluate and
to compare the duration of changes in speech between labial and lingual orthodontics.
Materials and Methods: A prospective longitudinal clinical study was designed to assess speech
of 24 patients undergoing labial or lingual orthodontic treatment. An objective spectrographic
evaluation of/s/sound was done using software PRAAT version 5.0.47, a semiobjective auditive
evaluation of articulation was done by four speech pathologists and a subjective assessment of
speech was done by four laypersons. The tests were performed before (T1), within 24 h (T2),
after 1 week (T3) and after 1 month (T4) of the start of therapy. The Mann-Whitney U-test for
independent samples was used to assess the signifi cance difference between the labial and lingual
appliances. A speech alteration with P  <  0.05 was considered to be signifi cant.
Results: The objective method showed a signifi cant difference to be present between the two
groups for the/s/sound in the middle position (P  <  0.001) at T3. The semiobjective assessment
showed worst speech performance in the lingual group to be present at T3 for vowels and blends
(P  <  0.01) and at T3 and T4 for alveolar and palatal consonants (P  <  0.01). The subjective assessment
also showed a signifi cant difference between the two groups at T3 (P  <  0.01) and T4 (P  <  0.05).
Conclusion: Both appliance systems caused a comparable speech diffi culty immediately after
bonding (T2). Although the speech recovered within a week in the labial group (T3), the lingual
group continued to experience discomfort even after a month (T4).

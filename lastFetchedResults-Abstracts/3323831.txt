For secure communication, we need random cryptographic keys. However, the sensor node which is slow processing device which is not able to perform the operations those generates a complex public key. Also, they cannot generate the good random number generator which is useful for key generation. This problem is solved by doing the measurements of per-packet signal strength which helps us to generate secret keys. The packet strength of another device as one of the sources of randomness is received using this generator. We can also use as a bidirectional synchronized transmission of constant bit rate (CBR) between two parties. Here one device stand on the surface and other devices moves around it. The each device can receive the result of source of randomness from the per-packet power. It also provides security from a third party. A third party cannot extract the information from the per-packet signal measurement generated by any devices if, it is not located near any transceiverÂ´s location or standing devices. Here results of the solution in network simulator NS-2 also present.

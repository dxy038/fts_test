Background & objective: Swimming pools and Jacuzzis as sports and recreational centers are used by many people in different ages and classes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between physicochemical characteristics and microbial contamination in Jacuzzi water and swimming pools in Golestan province.
Materials & Methods: In the present cross-sectional study with descriptive-analytic approach, eight indoor swimming pool and Jacuzzi were chosen to be investigated in the Golestan province. Biological (Total coliform, E.coli, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas) and physiochemical parameters (temperature, pH, turbidity, free chlorine residual) were performed according to standard methods.
Results: The obtained results showed a significant and positive correlation between turbidity and Pseudomonas in swimming pools (p=0.017). However, no significant relationship was observed between turbidity and other microorganisms. Also, it was revealed that there was a significant and positive correlation between total coliforms and fecal streptococci in the Jacuzzis . Beside an inverse relationship was found btween the free residual chlorine and indicator organisms.
 Conclusions: There is a high dispersion between microbial contamination and physicochemical variables in pools and Jacuzzis. In other wordو pools and Jacuzzis are very clean on some days and on some others, they are too polluted from the aspect of microorganisms’ presence and turbidity.. This indicates that there is  no appropriate operation for pools and Jacuzzis  in proportion of swimmer numbers and disinfection rate.

This paper presents an efficient methodology for the optimal location and sizing of fixed and switched shunt capacitors in radial distribution systems using Genetic Algorithms. Unlike the conventional objective function, a new constraint objective cost function has been formulated to maximize the net annual savings by minimizing real power loss and optimizing the purchase cost of shunt capacitors while maintaining a better node voltage profile of the system. The application results of the proposed method are demonstrated and compared with other method available in literature. The suitability of the proposed method is tested on a large-scale distribution system. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is indicated by higher savings in energy loss, lower amounts of capacitive compensation, better allocation of fixed and switched shunt capacitor ratings and increased net annual savings.

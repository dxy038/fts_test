In this paper, a multi-objective assignment problem is studied, in which two objectives, i.e., the profit and the consumed time, are considered. Due to the uncertainty of the real life, it is assumed that the elements of the profit matrix and the consumed time matrix are fuzzy variables. In order to obtain an assignment plan, a dependent-chance goal programming model is constructed for the problem. Also tabu search algorithm based on fuzzy simulation is designed to solve the problem. Finally, an example is given to show the efficiency of the algorithm

Structural parameters and material behaviors of an in-service structure are changed due to various external factors influence. Its structural strength is hard to be clearly expressed by mathematical formula. Based on the Grey system, taking the mean relative error as objective function and finding the optimum parameters q and r by optimizing, multi-variable optimization Grey model MGM (l, n, q, r) of the load-strain function in actual work condition was put forward. The failure load of the structure was forecasted. Calculation results show that this method is very effective to data processing which has high precision and easy to use. The method has wide applications in data processing in various engineering fields.

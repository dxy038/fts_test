In the marketing specialists recruiting process, making scientific, objective and fair assessment to the marketing graduate has a direct impact on the performance of corporate marketing. In our paper, through the Delphi method, we set up index system of graduate from marketing faculty first; secondly, we construct a model using the Triangular fuzzy number theory combined with FAHP (the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process) to assess marketing specialists. Finally, an illustrating example is given, in which three experts make fuzzy set on three marketing major graduates. Contract to traditional AHP method, this method is easier for experts to make fair and objective assessment and for enterprise to select marketing specialists.

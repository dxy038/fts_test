Isolated carbon nanotubes (CNTs), CNT films and CNT-polymer nanocomposites are a new generation of materials with outstanding mechanical, thermal, electrical and electromagnetic properties. The main objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive review on the investigations performed in the field of characterizing electrical and electromagnetic properties of isolated CNTs and CNT-reinforced polymers either theoretically or experimentally. The results reported in literature are reviewed and evaluated based on employed and/or developed methods by focusing on the electrical conductivity, permittivity and permeability properties. Available analytical and numerical simulations for predicting electrical properties of CNT-based composites are also reviewed. Besides, equivalent circuit modeling of nanocomposites containing CNTs is presented. The influence of effective parameters on overall electrical and electromagnetic characteristics of CNT-reinforced polymers is discussed based on published data. Therefore, highlighting the recent trends and challenges engaged in new investigations, those aspects which are required to be more deeply explored are introduced.

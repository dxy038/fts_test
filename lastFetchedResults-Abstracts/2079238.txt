In the present study with the objective of the surface protein hemagglutinin production for single radial immunodiffusion
reaction two methods of A/H5N1 recombinant strain A/AstanaRG/6:2/2009 highly purified hemagglutinin extraction
were studied. They are ion exchange chromatography and adsorption on formalinized erythrocytes using such detergents
as octyl glucoside, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, X-100 triton. Homogeneous highly purified hemagglutinin has
been obtained using the ion exchange chromatography.

This paper presents a software technology for prediction and mitigation the effects of electromagnetic field interference produced by the high voltage alternating current transmission lines (HVACL) on the underground metallic pipelines (UMP). The objective is to prove how the HVACL-UMP configurations can be numerically simulated regardless their complex topology (e.g. geographical position, number of pipes, transmission lines bonds and groundings etc.) and material properties (e.g. coating, soil resistivity etc.). The software accuracy will be demonstrated on a simple geometrical configuration with a well-known analytical solution. Practical results of the simulations on a complex configuration will be presented and analyzed with respect to the impact on the operating personnel exposure.

We discuss a group coordination architecture to support Internet-wide distributed collaboration, in particular for WWW-based distance education. With the current surge in e-commerce and Web-centric information exchange among users, the need for systems offering better telepresence and interaction capabilities becomes tangible. Group coordination in distributed systems and networked multimedia systems has many faces manifested in a variety of user interfaces and network protocols. However, to date no general methodology exists for engineering group coordination protocols to streamline the deployment of remote learning and collaboration environments. The objective of this article is to identify the key elements of a general group coordination framework, complementing existing group membership and multicast dissemination models, and to set the cornerstones for a coordination architecture which may be used to leverage the rapid development of group-oriented distributed collaborative applications in the Internet, for example for distance education, distributed scientific simulation and visualization, or similar applications.

Background and Objective: Meconium Stained Amniotic Fluid (MSAF) is a common finding in term and post term pregnancies which has been taken into account as an unfavorable predictor of fetal and neonatal outcome. The aim of this study was to identify some maternal risk factors and neonatal complications in term pregnancies with meconium stained and clear amniotic fluid in Rasht Al Zahra Hospital during 2010-2011. 
Materials and Methods: Throughout this cross-sectional analytic study, 300 pregnant women and term neonates with MSAF and 300 pregnant women and term neonates with clear amniotic fluid were studied in Rasht Al Zahra Hospital from 2010 to 2011. The collected data were processed and analyzed by SPSS-16 software.
Results: The most common maternal risk factors and neonatal complications which associated with MSAF were maternal gravidity and parity, mode of delivery, gestational age, Apgar score, neonatal birth weight and admission days. Maternal and neonatal infections were not significantly different in two groups.
Conclusion: The findings indicate that MSAF was significantly associated with lower maternal gravidity and parity, higher incidence of cesarean section rates, lower 1 minute Apgar scores and higher gestational age, neonatal birth weight and admission days; but there was no association between MSAF and chorioamnionitis.

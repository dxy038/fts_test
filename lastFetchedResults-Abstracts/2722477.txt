The goal of the European ICT Project EARTH is to enhance energy efficiency of current LTE cellular networks by 50 percent, enabling operators to provide more extensive coverage, namely to less densely populated areas, while ensuring high levels of efficiency, hence, reducing the carbon footprint. In order to achieve this objective, different strategies, at different levels, are being addressed. Energy efficient transmission techniques for LTE, proposed within the framework of EARTH, are addressed and discussed, with an emphasis on beamforming and MIMO. It is concluded that the strategic objective of EARTH is achievable. Combined MIMO mode selection, resource allocation, scheduling and precoding strategies will allow an energy consumption reduction of more than 50 percent in macro-cells. A reduction in MIMO power consumption of 91.7 percent (factor of 12) can be achieved in pico-cells.

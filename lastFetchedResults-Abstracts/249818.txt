In general, shell structural problems can be identi ed to fall into one of the categories of membranedominated,
bending-dominated and mixed shell problems. The asymptotic behaviour with a well-de ned
load-scaling factor shows distinctly into which category a given shell problem falls. The objective of this
paper is to present a shell problem and its solution for which there is no convergence to a well-de ned
load-scaling factor as the thickness of the shell decreases. Such shells are unduly sensitive in their
behaviour because the ratio of membrane to bending energy stored changes signi cantly and indeed
can  uctuate with changes in shell thickness. We brie y review the di erent asymptotic behaviours that
shell problems can display, and then present the speci c problem considered and its numerical solution
using  nite element analysis

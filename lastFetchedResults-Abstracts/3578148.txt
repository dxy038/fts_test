Switching has been observed in metal&#194;&#191;thin-insulator&#194;&#191;n-p+ structures, where the thin insulator is SiO2, or polycrystalline silicon. In this letter two alternative structures are discussed in which the n-p+ junction is replaced by a Schottky barrier. In the second device proposed two thin-insulator structures back-to-back are shown to exhibit bidirectional switching.

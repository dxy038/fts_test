Voltage control in distribution networks is an important task in electrical engineering systems. This paper deals with the development of control strategies for low voltage networks with a high penetration level of distributed generation. In order to improve load flow conditions and ensure power quality in the presence of decentralized power injections a model-based optimization algorithm is developed leading to changes in the network topology. Two voltage control strategies are presented including in their objective functions the node voltage deviations and the number of switching events. The optimization problem is stated as a constraint optimization problem, where the node voltages should remain in a certain band.

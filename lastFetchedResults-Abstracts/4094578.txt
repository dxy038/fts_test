The objective of this paper is to describe an innovative teaching technique consisting of pedagogy and motivation as instruments to gradually enhance the interest of mechanical engineering students for minoring in electrical engineering. A study was conducted comparing the performance of 87 students in four classes majoring in mechanical engineering at Temple University, USA. Confidentially conducted student surveys were statistically analyzed. In conclusion, the number of students opting to take up a minor in electrical engineering gradually increased from 0 to 36% reflecting the gradual increase in electrical engineering content, through an emphasis on pedagogical strategy and the motivation provided

Two major goals in multi-objective optimization are to obtain a set of nondominated solutions as closely as possible to the true Pareto front (PF) and maintain a well-distributed solution set along the Pareto front. In this paper, we propose a teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm for multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). In our algorithm, we adopt the nondominated sorting concept and the mechanism of crowding distance computation. The teacher of the learners is selected from among current nondominated solutions with the highest crowding distance values and the centroid of the nondominated solutions from current archive is selected as the Mean of the learners. The performance of proposed algorithm is investigated on a set of some benchmark problems and real life application problems and the results show that the proposed algorithm is a challenging method for multi-objective algorithms.

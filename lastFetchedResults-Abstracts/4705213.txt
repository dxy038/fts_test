This paper examines factors which might affect the performance of e-commerce Web sites, and presents a framework for evaluation. We introduce a workable framework for evaluating web sites. Key success factors, based on earlier research, are used as objective performance measures. The framework was used to assess a selected range of on-line businesses. The outcome of the study demonstrated the appropriateness of the identified success factors and the usefulness of constructing such frameworks.

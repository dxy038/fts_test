Risks include the factors that might adversely affect project outcomes. Risk analysis includes the processes concerned with identifying, analyzing and developing security strategy and plans for the factors. Although currently there are known methodologies such as (CCTA Risk Analysis and Management Method (CRAMM) or Consultative, Objective and Bi-functional Risk Analysis (COBRA) and so on) for Risk Management, they have common failure for instance no specific function which recover/avoid risks/attacks toward IS/IT component or poor executive support, high cost of implementation, untimely response, insufficient accountability, inability to qualitatively measure control environment ,infrequent in assessment, inaccurate data. On one hand these problems and on the other hand importance of IS/IT Risk Management cause the research to develop the current methodologies by making them intelligent as like as the natural management systems, it means that Immune System for example which is a complete system and could be the best model for simulating it with Risk Management in the organizations. However the findings of this study are important to help organizations toward improving IS/IT Risk Analysis process which are designed and proposed by investigation about their current procedure and problems of Risk Management. So the information as findings of this paper could be published and more extensive studies could be planned for the future.

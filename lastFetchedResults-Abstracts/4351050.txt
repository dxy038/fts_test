Opportunistic sensing allows to efficiently collect information about the physical world and the persons behaving in it. This may mainstream human context and activity recognition in wearable and pervasive computing by removing requirements for a specific deployed infrastructure. In this paper we introduce the newly started European research project OPPORTUNITY within which we develop mobile opportunistic activity and context recognition systems. We outline the projectÂ´s objective, the approach we follow along opportunistic sensing, data processing and interpretation, and autonomous adaptation and evolution to environmental and user changes, and we outline preliminary results.

In this paper, a region reaching controller with motion constraints is proposed for robot manipulator. In this control concept, the desired objective can be specified as a region instead of a point. In addition, physical constraints can be imposed on the robot motion by defining an additional region for the robot. For example, a region for the boundary of the end effector to avoid singular points or a region to ensure visibility of the features during visual servoing. We show that the stability of the system can be ensured in the presence of the motion constraints. The proposed region reaching controller is implemented on an industrial robot and experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controllers.

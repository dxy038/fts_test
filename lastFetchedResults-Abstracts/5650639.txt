This paper presents a decentralized control algorithm for swarm of robots based on geometric approach. Our objective is to build a swarm that can demonstrate collective behavior. The control algorithm, which is executed by all the members of the swarm, is presented in details. Our simulation results show that group behaviors such as aggregation, obstacle avoidance and flocking are achieved successfully.

The honeycomb sandwich composite material has been widely applied in engineering due to its excellent mechanical performance. The elastic properties of honeycomb core is of crucial importance in efficient mechanical analysis. An approach on determining the equivalent elastic modulus of honeycomb core using experimental modal data is proposed in this paper. Based on analytically predicted elastic constants of the pure core, the initial finite element model of a honeycomb panel is constructed using a three-layer sandwich theory; according to errors that exist in analytically estimated equivalent parameters and the sensitivity analysis of modal frequencies with respect to system parameters, the out-of-plane shear moduli Gcxz and Gcyz are selected to be determined. Consequently, the two parameters are determined by minimizing an objective function which is formulated with vibration test and numerical modal data. Comparative investigations are conducted to illustrate that the initial values of the parameters with physical significance play an important role in the identification procedure. The presented method can provide accurate and reliable predictions of material constitutive parameters of honeycomb core.

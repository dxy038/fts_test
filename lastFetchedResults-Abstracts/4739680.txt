In order to evaluate the credibility of software behaviors more reasonably and accurately, a trust model of software behaviors based on check point risk evaluation is presented. Firstly, adopt fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to figure out the weight of every risk factor of check point, meanwhile, assess the modules value according to Markov Chain Usage Model, thus calculating out the risk value of check point and accumulating every suspected risk check point, and then adopt rewarding or punishment mechanism to evaluate a software behaviors trustworthy, which can judge whether software behaviors are credible or not. The simulated experiment shows that this model can distinguish the potential risk effectively in software behaviors, evaluate the risk value trustworthy and provide objective and reliable information to judge whether software behaviors are credible or not.

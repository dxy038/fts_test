
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) are significantly increased in postmenopausal ages. The mechanism about relation between menopause and SUI is not clear. Perhaps decreased level of hormone induced these problems. Therefore, this study was carried out to assess the relationship between estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), P53 and the development of SUI and to elucidate the bimolecular pathophysiology of SUI.
METHODS: This is a case control study. Ten menopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence and 10 menopausal women without POP selected for hysterectomy entered into this study. The sample of anterior vaginal walls and uterosacral ligaments were obtained. The relative ER, PR and P53 levels in the samples were obtained by immunohistochemical staining.
FINDINGS: The mean age (±SD) of the control group was 56.2±5.6 years and in the sample group it was 56.4±6.8 years. The mean age and the body mass index and the number of vaginal deliveries and the number of years of menopausal in two groups were similar. The P53 in the control group was 14±6.21 and in the sample group was 0.7±0.67. The ER level in the control group was 36±9.36 and in the sample group was 1.20 ±1.61. The PR level in the control group was 42.5±6.34 and in the sample group was 2±1.33. The result in the anterior vaginal wall and uterosacral ligament were similar. Expression of ER and PR and P53 was significant lower in the study group.
CONCLUSION: The expression levels of P53, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor in patients with POP and SUI were significantly lower than the control group.

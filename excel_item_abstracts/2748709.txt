This work describes in detail the Radiation Hardness Assurance methodology applied to the development of new radiation tolerant power converter control system for the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). This system is based primarily on commercial-off-the-shelf components for which the extensive testing scheme is applied to decrease the probability of radiation failures during the operation of the LHC machine in the high-luminosity operating conditions era.

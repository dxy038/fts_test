One type of environmental hazards in many areas in our country that causes destroying agricultural lands, rangeland
and Infrastructure is gully erosion. In this study, fuzzy logic operators are used to determine the different hazard zones,
obtain the area of each of them and gully erosion hazard map in Troud watershed. To achieve this objective, satellite
imagery, aerial photo interpretation with scale of 1:20000, topographic maps with scale of 1:50000, geological maps
with scale of 1:100000, field studies and ArcGIS software has been used as research tools. For this purpose, at first a
few effective variables that have important role in the formation and development of gully erosion and gully erosion
areas were identified. The next step, Effective factors classes were weighted And Gully erosion maps were prepared
using fuzzy operators including fuzzy Algebraic sum, fuzzy product, fuzzy gamma0.5 and fuzzy gamma 0.8 in GIS
environment. The results indicated that, in fuzzy Algebraic sum method was located 100% of the gully in high zone.
83.29% of the gullies have occurred in low zone in fuzzy product. According to the results obtained, 60.93% of the
gullies were located in low zone and 17 % of gullies have occurred in high and very high zones in method fuzzy
gamma 0.5. In fuzzy gamma 0.8 method, were located 1.5% of the gullies in low zone and 62% of the gullies in high
and very high zones

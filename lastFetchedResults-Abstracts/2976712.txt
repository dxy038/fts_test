The influence of stimulated Raman scattering on the channel power balance in bidirectional wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmission has been analyzed experimentally and numerically. Output power levels with 8 channels/direction launched at +10 dBm/ch. differ more than 0.7 dB from linear loss.

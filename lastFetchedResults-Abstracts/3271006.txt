The objective of this paper is to study a review of Indian Rice Husk Ash (RHA) as a partial cement replacement in different percentage and performance of strength and durability of RHA blended concrete. The demand for producing durable construction material is the result of the environmental pollution. Supplementary cementitious materials prove to be effective to meet most of the requirements of durable concrete, RHA is available in plenty to other supplementary materials like silica fume and fly ash, Due to its high pozzolanic activity, both strength and durability of concrete are improved. This paper presents a over view of the work carried out on the use of Indian RHA to improve the strength and durability of concrete.

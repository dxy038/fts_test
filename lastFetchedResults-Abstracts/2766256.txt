The objective of this work is to enhance performance of impulse radio ultra wide band transmissions in multiple-user environment, without implementing complex multiuser detectors. A new scrambling scheme, randomising the pulse width, is introduced at the transmitter. It allows both to improve the spectral occupancy of the transmitted signal and the resistance to interference. This informationless scrambler is analysed and optimised with an evolutionary algorithm to achieve, according to simulations, significant improvement.

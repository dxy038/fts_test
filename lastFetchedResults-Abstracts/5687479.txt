To select and retain high-potential talents is very critical for modern companies or organizations to maintain competitive advantages in such rapidly changing environment. Traditional personnel evaluation methodologies focusing on performance ranking, related test result and general image feedback from direct managers will no longer be appropriate to employees in knowledge-based economy. This paper aims to design an effective, transparent, objective and business strategy aligned computer aided human resource personnel evaluation system integrating financial performance with non-financial aspects during the process of each task. This evaluation system offers an integrated view of overall talent competency and potential, which gives more scientific warranty for HR decision-making. Besides these, the process-based personnel evaluation information system provides an information exchange platform based on Web 2.0 technology, which helps employees to proactively attend and to influence the evaluation process, which makes it more transparent.

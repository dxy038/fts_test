
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Use of effective supplements on physical function in comparison to industrial supplements is important for a lot of sports nutrition scientists. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interactive effect of endurance exercise and crude alcoholic extract of magnolia on interleukin-6, interleukin-10, glucose, and glycogen in male rat liver.
METHODS: In this experimental study, twenty one 6-8 week male rats were divided into 3 groups of saline-control, saline training and magnolia training. The training groups ran on treadmill for 8 weeks (60 min/d, 5d/wk at 25 m/min and 0% grade). Magnolia extract and saline in equal volume (2 mg per kg body weight) from the beginning of the second week for 4 weeks (5 days per week) were fed to three groups. Effect of extract on Il-6 and Il-10 were measured with ELISA method, and glucose and glycogen were measured with Colorimetric method.	
FINDINGS: IL-10 in practice groups (8.23±1.57 pg/ml versus 25.04±3.05 pg/ml) were significantly lower (p=0.0001). While, Il-6 in saline training group (208.43±48 pg/ml) showed a significant increase in compared to control group (151.29± 23.08 pg/ml) (p=0.04). Glucose level (75.14±24.64 mg/dl versus 87.29±15.07 mg/dl) and glycogen level (3.74± 0.6 mg/g versus 4.67±0.51 mg/g liver tissue) in saline training group were significantly lower (p=0.114 and p=0.024, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the improvement of liver glycogen induced by magnolia could prevent from exercise-induced increase in IL-6.

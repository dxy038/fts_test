During the last six years, the National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad has established
a semi-permanent seismological network of 5 broadband seismographs and 10 accelerographs in the Kachchh
seismic zone, Gujarat, with the prime objective to monitor the continued aftershock activity of the 2001 Mw7.7
Bhuj mainshock. The reliable and accurate broadband data for the Mw 7.6 (8 Oct., 2005) Kashmir earthquake
and its aftershocks from this network, as well as from the Hyderabad Geoscope station, enabled us to estimate
the group velocity dispersion characteristics and the one-dimensional regional shear-velocity structure of
peninsular India. Firstly, we measure Rayleigh- and Love-wave group velocity dispersion curves in the range
of 8 to 35 sec and invert these curves to estimate the crustal and upper mantle structure below the western part of
peninsular India. Our best model suggests a two-layered crust: The upper crust is 13.8-km thick with a shear
velocity (Vs) of 3.2 km/s; the corresponding values for the lower crust are 24.9 km and 3.7 km/sec. The shear
velocity for the upper mantle is found to be 4.65 km/sec. Based on this structure, we perform a moment tensor
(MT) inversion of the bandpass (0.05–0.02 Hz) filtered seismograms of the Kashmir earthquake. The best fit is
obtained for a source located at a depth of 30 km, with a seismic moment, Mo, of 1.6 · 1027 dyne-cm, and a
focal mechanism with strike 19.5 , dip 42 , and rake 167 . The long-period magnitude (MA * Mw) of this
earthquake is estimated to be 7.31. An analysis of well-developed sPn and sSn regional crustal phases from the
bandpassed (0.02–0.25 Hz) seismograms of this earthquake at four stations in Kachchh suggests a focal depth of
30.8 km.

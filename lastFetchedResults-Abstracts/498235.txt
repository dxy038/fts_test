The objective of this study was to examine the effect of different amounts of Super AB A 200 water-absorbent hydrogel on different types of porosity, water holding capacity and hydraulic conductivity of sandy loam soils in 2008-2009. The treatments of the experiment were :1) soil type including sandy loam soils and 2) Super AB A 200 water-absorbent hydrogel in six levels including 0 (control), 0.05, 0.15, 0.30, 0.45 and 0.60 percent by weight .The study was carried out using a completely randomized block design with three replications, with 1.5*1.5 m plots, in research field of the Islamic Azad University, Shahre-rey Branch. The results showed that the addition of hydrogel and increased usage levels of it resulted in porosity augmentation, especially capillary porosity, as compared to the control. The application of water-absorbent hydrogel in levels of 0.45 and 0.60 percent increased the available water by 2 and 2.5 times, respectively. The hydraulic conductivity of soil was increased with increasing the level of water-absorbent hydrogel. The statistical analysis of means showed that there was a significant difference (pr<0.001) between different levels of hydrogel usage together and with the control, in augmentation of capillary porosity, available water and soil hydraulic conductivity. According to the statistical analysis and economic aspects ,the application of 0.45% Super AB A 200 water-absorbent hydrogel is recommended to improve structure in sandy loam soils and increase their water holding capacity for optimum plant growth.

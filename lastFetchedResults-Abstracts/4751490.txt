Proposes a self-tuning fuzzy logic controller for the slip energy recovery system. The control system is designed to maintain efficiency of motor by keeping the speed constant and the good transient response by using direct torque control. Fuzzy logic controller has been designed by genetic algorithm optimization technique as a means to determine and optimize the fuzzy logic controller design. In the proposed approach normalization factors and/or membership function parameters and/or the controller policy, are translated into bit-strings. These bit-strings are processed by the genetic algorithm and if the selection process as well as the objective function is chosen properly, a near-optimal solution can be found. To examine the efficiency of the proposed approach, a self-tuning fuzzy logic controller for direct torque control of the wound rotor induction motor drive is designed for the current in DC link circuit. A particular objective function is chosen to achieve a high dynamic performance. The simulation results demonstrate a significant enhancement in shortening the development time, and improving system performance over a conventional fuzzy logic controller

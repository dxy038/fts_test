We consider joint beamforming and power control as a means to maximize throughput in a CDMA wireless uplink, where a base station equipped with multiple antennas receives from single - antenna wireless users. Throughput maximization gives rise to an optimization problem with objective function that is in general non-concave in the power and beam- forming vectors. We introduce two iterative algorithms searching for the optimal solution; both of these alternate between a power control step, and a beamforming step. Simulation results illustrate the convergence of the proposed algorithms to a locally optimal pair of power vector and beamforming array.

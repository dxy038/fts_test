In this paper we present an approach for extracting interpretable information granules for classification. The approach, called DC<sup>&#947;</sup> (double clustering with genetic algorithms) is based on two clustering steps. The first step uses LVQ1 to identify cluster prototypes in the multidimensional data space so as to represent hidden relationships among data. In the second step a genetic algorithm is applied to the projections of these prototypes with the objective of finding a minimal number of fuzzy information granules that verify some interpretability constraints. The key feature of DC<sup>&#947;</sup> is the efficiency of the minimization process carried out in the second step. Experimental results on two medical diagnosis problems show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of accuracy, interpretability and efficiency.

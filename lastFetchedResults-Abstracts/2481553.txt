This research proposes a unied scheme to mathematically model and multiobjectively
optimize the EDM parameters on tungsten carbide cobalt alloy (WC-6%Co),
applying response surface methodology and a desirability function technique. Discharge
current, pulse on-time, duty cycle and average discharge voltage have been chosen to
be correlated with material removal rate, tool wear rate and surface roughness (Ra) as
performance measures. The required experimental data were obtained in accordance with
the face-centered central composite design. Signicant parameters in the form of main, twoway
interaction and pure quadratic eects were carefully identied conducting a complete
analysis of variance at 1%, 5% and 7% signicance levels, and the adequacy of all tted
second order regression models was conrmed. Parametric analysis was undertaken through
direct and reciprocity eect plots to fully reveal the dierent facets of ED-machinability
characteristics. Finally, the optimization issue has been formulated as multi-objective from
which the optimal parametric setting, yielding the most enviable conditions simultaneously,
was then obtained in a compromised manner employing the notion of a desirability concept.
The predicted optimal results were also interpreted and veried experimentally. The values
of relative validation errors are all quite satisfactory (below 11%), which prove the ecacy
and reliability of the suggested approach.

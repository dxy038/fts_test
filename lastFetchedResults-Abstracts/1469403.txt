Urine is one of the most attractive analyte used for clinical diagnosis. NSCLC (non-small cell lung carcinoma), which includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large-cell carcinoma, is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. In the present study, urinary proteomes of normal individuals and NSCLC patients were compared using 1D SDS-PAGE. From the distinctly differentially expressed bands in SDS-PAGE gel, 40 proteins were identified by chip-HPLC-MS/MS, including five proteins relevant to NSCLC. One of the selected proteins, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (AACT), was further validated in urine by western blot and in lung tissue by immunohistochemistry staining. Higher expression level of AACT in NSCLC patients was observed by western blot when compared with normal urine samples. Significantly, the NSCLC tumor tissue (18 out of 20 cases, 90%) showed a significantly higher expression level of AACT compared to adjacent non-tumor lung tissue (3 out of 20 cases, 15%). These results establish AACT as a potential biomarker for objective and non-invasive diagnosis of NSCLC in urine and the other four NSCLC-related proteins were also listed.

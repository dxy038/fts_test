This paper presents the solar cells fabrication on multicrystalline silicon substrate with maximum efficiency of 13% by laboratory technology and main equipments used to characterization of such devices. The main objective was the minimizing the production cost maintaining the device performances. For these reasons the general concept of the technology consists of maximum seven steps, was used multicrystalline silicon substrate, the front surface solar cell was texturized in order to reduce the light reflectivity and the wafer back side was p+ diffused in order to have low series resistance.

The authors present a method for the analysis of the operation of a self-excited induction generator which also provides a procedure for the computation of the required external control capacitance and resistance. A number of switchable control capacitors and resistors can be used to provide variation in discrete steps in order to balance active and reactive power. The objective is to develop a dynamic model of the conversion scheme to regulate the frequency and terminal voltage between the limits fixed for performance criteria. The dynamic simulation of the wind-turbine-driven asynchronous generator demonstrates that an autonomous self-excited operation can be realized to supply power to electrical variable loads even with control variables varying in discrete steps, not only of capacitance but also of resistance

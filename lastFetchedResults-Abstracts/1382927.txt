Thermography is a non-contact, non-invasive technique that detects surface heat emitted as infrared radiation. Because skin temperature reflects the status of underlying tissue metabolism and blood circulation, abnormal thermal patterns can signify areas of superficial inflammation. The objective of this study was to determine if thermography could detect the injection of analgesic and neurolytic agents and surgical palmar digital neurectomy. Procedures evaluated include injection of the lumbar region, suspensory ligaments, tibial nerve, palmar digital nerves, and palmar digital neurectomy. Thermographic images were obtained before and after the procedures until a significant difference was no longer detected. Local injection of the lumbar region and the suspensory ligament produced detectable thermal patterns for two days, and tibial nerve infiltration with a neurolytic agent was significant for two days. Analgesia of the palmar nerves was significant for 24 h with bupivicaine, compared to five days for ammonium chloride. Palmar digital neurectomy produced more variable thermal patterns. While sensitive enough to detect changes in heat patterns from control regions, thermography is not specific enough to discriminate between procedures and injury inducing an inflammatory response.

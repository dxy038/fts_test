Background and Objective: Depression is a prevalent disease among students with symptoms such as depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and increased fatigability. It also can complicate other medical conditions, and can even be serious enough to increase the chance of risky behaviors such as drug or alcohol addiction or lead to suicide. Present research aimed to study the prevalence of student depression based on demographic parameters.
Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study, using access sampling were selected 83 pharmacy students in Zanjan University of Medical Sciences during the year 2014. Data were collected using Beck depression questionnaire as well as the relevant demographic and analyzed by SPSS-18.
Results: the research  results indicated that the prevalence of depression was 9.4%. Also results showed that there is significant difference in the prevalence of depression between native and non- native students (p < 0.01). But no significant difference was observed in the prevalence of depression based on sex. In addition, there wasnâ€™t a significant relationship between education mean and depression. 
Conclusions: The results provide some evidence that separation from family can affect the prevalence of depression in students. Therefore, in order to decrease the prevalence of student depression, it may be useful to consider regular psycho-training courses and selection of native students.

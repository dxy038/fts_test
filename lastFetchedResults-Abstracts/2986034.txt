The use of multimedia in education has become a key element to improve the quality of education and to reduce the cost of the educational system. Also, the students have the benefit of learning and understanding the material better than in the conventional way. In this work, a learning package called "Multimedia Learning Center or MLC" has been developed and tested. The main objective of this center is to help university students and others to learn data communication and network concepts, architectures and operations. The center is World Wide Web (WWW) based, and it allows any student that uses a standard modem for Internet access to use our center. The center has been developed to be easy to use. The initial evaluation of the center examined by a few students have complemented that the center has improved their understanding to some data communication concepts which the center already supports. Although our intention is to support two topics at the first stage of this project, other topics can be added easily to the center. Any professor who is willing to put his course in the center can achieve this without any prior knowledge about the internal design of the center.

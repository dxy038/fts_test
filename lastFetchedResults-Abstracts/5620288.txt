This paper proposes a novel feedrate control scheme utilized in real-time non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) interpolation algorithm for the contouring control purpose. The objective is to improve the contour error performance to achieve high-precision standard. The proposed structure can provide the action that once the contour error is large in the relative sense, then the feedrate will be adequately reduced to provide sufficient time for controller to settle. By real-time adjusting the feedrate, contour error will not accumulate such that the precision can be effectively improved. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and comparison with other control methods is also arranged. All the obtained results indeed demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

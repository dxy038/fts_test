Addressing problems of larger volume of harmonic gear in the conventional design, in this paper, a mathematical model of optimization with hybrid discrete variables is proposed by taking the modulus of harmonic gear transmission parameters m, the length of flexspline L, wall thickness &#948; and tooth width of flexspline b as design variables, and the sum of volume of circular spline and flexspline as an objective function to be minimized. During the procedure of optimization, the basic idea of the hybrid genetic algorithm is constructed, and the basic procedure of the hybrid genetic algorithm is compiled. The hybrid genetic algorithm used in the parameter optimization of harmonic gear drive is testified to be effective, and optimization results can meet the design standard. Therefore, the proposed method will be of the significant guiding value to engineering practices.

Abstract 
Objective:The present study aims to compare the decrease of 
depression level resulted by two different treatments of logo therapy 
and REBT applied on MS patients. 
Method:Three groups of subjects, each consisting of 12 people, 
were selected from among MS patients at Sina Clinic. They were 
randomly assigned into two experimental groups and one control 
group. The experimental groups received REBT group sessions, and 
no psychotherapy was given to the control group. The data was 
collected using Beck Depression Inventory which was performed 
three times (including pretest, posttest, and follow-up stages). The 
data was then analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Scheffe Test. 
Results:The results proved the effectiveness of both methods in 
reducing the level of depression in MS patients as well as its durability 
for three months. Moreover, logo therapy was more helpful in 
decreasing depression that REBT. Therefore, both methods, especially 
group logo therapy, are recommended to apply for treating MS 
patients.

Flow resistance of natural grasses, sedges and willows was studied in a laboratory flume. The objective was to investigate, how type, density and placement of vegetation, flow depth and velocity influence friction losses. The plants were studied in various combinations under nonsubmerged and submerged conditions in a total of 350 test runs. The results show large variations in the friction factor, f, with depth of flow, velocity, Reynolds number, and vegetative density. The friction factor was dependent mostly on (1) the relative roughness in the case of grasses; (2) the flow velocity in the case of willows and sedges/grasses combined; and (3) the flow depth in the case of leafless willows on bare bottom soil. Leaves on willows seemed to double or even triple the friction factor compared to the leafless case despite the fact that the bottom was growing sedges in both cases. For the leafless willows, f appeared to increase with depth almost linearly and independently of velocity. Unexpectedly, different spacing of the same number of leafless willows with grasses did not have any significant effect on f. Based on the experimental work, a better understanding of flow resistance due to different combinations of natural stiff and flexible vegetation under nonsubmerged and submerged conditions was gained.

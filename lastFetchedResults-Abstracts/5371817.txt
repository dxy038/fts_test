This paper is about the segmentation of Braille words and the transformation from Mandarin Braille to Chinese characters. Braille word segmentation consists of the rules base, the signs base of segmentation and knowledge base for disambiguation and mistakes. By using adjacency constraints and bidirectional maximum matching with a dictionary, our system´s segmentation precision is better than 99% for the common text. By incorporating a pinyin knowledge dictionary into the system, we perfectly solved the problem of ambiguity in the translation from Braille to pinyin and developed a statistical language model based on the transformation of pinyin into characters. By using a multi-knowledge base to carry out the disambiguation process for each pinyin sentence, we built a multi-level graph and used a Viterbi search to find the sequence of Chinese characters with maximum likelihood, and used an N-best algorithm to get the N most likely character sequences. The experimental results show that the system´s overall precision for translation from Braille codes to Chinese characters is 94.38%

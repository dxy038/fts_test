Complementary code keying (CCK) is employed by IEEE 802.11b wireless local area network (WLAN) for higher data rate transmission. However CCK suffers severe performance degradation at the presence of co-channel interference. Smart antenna system has been shown to be an effective method of mitigating interference. The main objective of this paper is to develop a smart antenna system for IEEE 802.11b WLAN. We demonstrate the performance improvement at the presence of co-channel interference with the aid of computer simulation.

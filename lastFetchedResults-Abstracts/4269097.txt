The SEMSPLC project is a collaborative research programme funded by DTI and SERC. Its primary objective was to establish a software engineering method suitable for development of safety critical PLC based programs in an application language suited to industrial control. The members of the project fall into two distinct communities: those with a conventional software engineering background, and those who have an industrial PLC background. The project has been attempting to pool the experience of the two camps to produce a method for engineering safe PLC software

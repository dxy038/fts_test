Abstract
Background and Objective:Staphylococcusaureus is one of the important factors causing nosocomial infections. Typically 25-30 percent of healthy people carry the bacteria in their anterior nasal cavity. The physicians(50%), nurses (70%) and hospital staff   (90%) are the carriers of this bacteria, leading to the infection of inpatients. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus strains tovancomycin and methicillin has brought about several problems in treatment of the infections caused by Staphylococcus strains. Hence, we aimed to study the frequency of staphylococcus aureus carriers and resistance pattern among medical personnel of the surgical ward in ShahidRajaee hospital, Tonekabon.
Material and Methods: this analytic-descriptive study was conducted on the samples taken from nasal carriage of medical staff of surgical ward (N=120). Antibiotic- resistant of Staphylococcus strains was assessed by antibiogram and disk diffusion (DAD), in accordance with CLSI standards.
Results:  of 34 (28.33%) who are nasal carriers of staphylococcus, 12 are over 30 years old and 24 under 30. Based on antibiogram, 1.97% of specimens are sensitive to Gentamicin and Co-trimoxazole, 1.94% to Ciprofloxacin, 2.88% to Vancomycin and 6.20% to Methicillin. In addition, 100% of specimens are resistant to Ampicillin, 1.97% to Penicillin and 2.88% to Amoxicillin.  Four isolates areresistant,both to methicillin and vancomycin.
Conclusion:In this study, the spectrum of S. aureus resistant and sensitive strains to some antibiotics is similar to other studies, but a dramatic increase is seen in the rate of MRSA and non-susceptible cases to vancomycin.  The Effectiveness of Penicillin, Amoxicillin and Ampicillin is still very low on S. aureus samples.

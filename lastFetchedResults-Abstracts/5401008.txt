In order to obtain trustworthy QoS (Quality of Service) in situations which have little or no information regarding a serviceÂ´s QoS, we propose a QoS measure approach, namely Bayesian Approach with Maximum-Entropy Principle (BA-MEP). BA-MEP firstly extracts the QoS prior distribution from the objective data (such as historical statistics data) and subjective data (such as the service providers and QoS experts) by Maximum Entropy Principle, and then Bayesian Approach is used to infer the QoS posterior distribution, finally, trustworthy QoS can be obtained from the QoS model. In addition, we also propose a trustworthy expert algorithm (TEA) and analysis three reasons that the QoS data of Web services are not always true. Some experiments are illustrated to show the effectiveness of BA-MEP.

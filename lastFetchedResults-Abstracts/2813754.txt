This paper presents a neural interface system-on-chip (SoC), featuring combined spike recording, electrical microstimulation and real-time stimulus artifact rejection (SAR) for bidirectional interfacing with the central nervous system. Fabricated in AMS 0.35&#956;m 2P/4M CMOS, the SoC integrates a spike-recording front-end with input noise voltage of 3.42&#956;V<sub>rms</sub> (0.5Hz-50kHz), microstimulating back-end for delivering charge-balanced monophasic or asymmetric biphasic current pulses up to ~100&#956;A with passive discharge, and nW-level digital signal processing (DSP) unit for real-time SAR based on template subtraction. The 3.1 &#215; 3.1-mm<sup>2</sup> SoC has been characterized in benchtop tests and neurobiological experiments in isolated buccal ganglia of an Aplysia catifornica (a marine sea slug). The SoC can successfully remove large stimulus artifacts from the contaminated neural data in real time and recover extracellular neural spikes that occur on the tail end of the artifacts. The root-mean-square (rms) value of the pre-processed stimulus artifact is reduced on average by a factor of ~24 post-processing.

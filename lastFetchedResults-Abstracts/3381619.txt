In this letter, the authors present an approach for designing discrete packaging of a bidirectional power switch used in matrix converter applications. The study is based on computing the magnetic field inside a specific resonant switching cell in order to incorporate low-voltage control circuits inside the compact space volume of the power module. The novelty of the proposed configuration is the creation of an oriented magnetic field area, which has very low impact on the low-level control signals of the power devices. Numerical analyses as well as experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.

Several studies about schizophrenia have shown a cognitive bias named “Jumping to Conclusions” (JTC), defined as a decision made quickly on the basis of little evidence that occurs in these patients when performing probabilistic reasoning paradigms. The main objective of this study is to compare JTC bias and BADE (Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence) in patients with schizophrenia vs. participants with high/low schizotypy to understand the underlying mechanism of these cognitive biases. Probabilistic reasoning was assessed using a modified version of Drawing to Decision task. In addition to the traditional parameters of this task (Plausibility Rating (PR), Draws to Decision (DTD), BADE) we also calculated new parameters, overall accuracy and one named Feedback Sensitivity (FS) which lower scores shows greater use of feedback. The results of the study suggest a context effect: in the cued condition, there were not main differences between groups. In the uncued condition, we found higher JTC bias at stage 1 for patients. At the same time, PR at first stages related positively with Feedback Sensitivity and negatively with accuracy for patients and high schizotypy participants (high confidence is associated with worse performance and lower feedback use). BADE seems unrelated to JTC bias and FS. The results are discussed in terms of JTC like as a clinical bias and whether patients with schizophrenia are less able to use feedback.

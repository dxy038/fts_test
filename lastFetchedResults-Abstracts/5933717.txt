In this paper, we consider active sampling to label pixels grouped with hierarchical clustering. The objective of the method is to match the data relationships discovered by the clustering algorithm with the user´s desired class semantics. The first is represented as a complete tree to be pruned and the second is iteratively provided by the user. The active learning algorithm proposed searches the pruning of the tree that best matches the labels of the sampled points. By choosing the part of the tree to sample from according to current pruning´s uncertainty, sampling is focused on most uncertain clusters. This way, large clusters for which the class membership is already fixed are no longer queried and sampling is focused on division of clusters showing mixed labels. The model is tested on a VHR image in a multiclass classification setting. The method clearly outperforms random sampling in a transductive setting, but cannot generalize to unseen data, since it aims at optimizing the classification of a given cluster structure.

Objective
This study was undertaken to compare rates of preterm delivery according to cervical mucus interleukin-8 (IL-8) among women who underwent cerclage because of a short cervix.
Study design
This retrospective study included 16,508 patients whose cervical length and cervical mucus IL-8 concentrations were measured between 20 and 24 weeks. A short cervix was defined by a length of 25 mm or less, whereas IL-8 concentrations exceeding 360 ng/mL were considered high. Whether to perform cerclage was decided by clinicians without consideration of IL-8 concentrations.
Results
Among all subjects, a significantly smaller percentage of subjects avoided delivery before 37 weeks when cervical mucus IL-8 was elevated (P = .0302) or the cervix was short (P< .0001). Among patients with a short cervix, preterm delivery was more likely when cervical mucus IL-8 was elevated. Overall, risk of preterm delivery in patients with a short cervix did not differ between those undergoing and not undergoing cerclage. However, among patients with a short cervix, those with normal IL-8 concentrations in cervical mucus were less likely to have preterm delivery if they underwent cerclage (before 37 weeks, 33% vs 54.5%, P = .01; before 34 weeks, 4% vs 13.6%, P = .03). In contrast, when cervical mucus IL-8 was high, delivery before 37 weeks was more likely with than without cerclage (78% vs 54.1%, P = .03).
Conclusion
With normal cervical mucus IL-8, cerclage treatment for cervical shortening may reduce the rate of preterm delivery, but with elevated cervical mucus IL-8 cerclage may be harmful.

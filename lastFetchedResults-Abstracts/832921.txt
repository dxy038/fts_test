The paper reviews options for structural design sensitivity analysis, including global finite differences, continuum derivatives, discrete derivatives, and computational or automated differentiation. The objective is to put these different approaches to design sensitivity analysis in the context of accuracy and consistency, computational cost, and implementation options and effort. Linear static analysis and transient dynamic analysis are reviewed. In a separate appendix, special attention is paid to the semi-analytical method. A future paper will address design sensitivity analysis in nonlinear structural problems.

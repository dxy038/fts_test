Spatial resolution is an important parameter that allows an objective assessment of the imaging system performance. In remote sensing, Effective Instantaneous Field of View (EIFOV) is the most used parameter to measure spatial resolution and enables comparison between different sensors. This paper describes a system named SPAREC 1.0 for automatic estimation of the spatial resolution for CBERS CCD Camera. The automatic system operates using four algorithms and consists of three main stages: in the first stage the user selects the sub-image from the original spectral band image of desired target. In the second stage he extracts the sub-image of the target and then in the third stage the system processes the sub-image to provide the estimated spatial resolution. The results obtained are comparable with pre-flight measurement and with the results obtained before the development of SPAREC 1.0.

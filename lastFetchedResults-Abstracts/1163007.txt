Failures in critical infrastructures may be hazardous to population, economy, and national security. There can be strong interdependencies between various infrastructures, but these interdependencies are seldom accounted for in current risk and vulnerability analyses. To reduce probability and mitigate consequences of infrastructure failures, these interdependencies have to be assessed. The objective of this paper is to present a method for assessing interdependencies of critical infrastructures, as part of a cross-sector risk and vulnerability analysis. The method is based on a relatively simple approach applicable for practitioners, but may be extended for more detailed analyses by specialists. Examples from a case study with the Emergency Preparedness Group of the city of Oslo, Norway, are included.

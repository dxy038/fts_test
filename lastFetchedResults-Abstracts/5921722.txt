This paper describes a detailed operation analysis, proposed dc side control strategy, and implementation of the BQ-ZSI (bidirectional quasi-Z-source inverter) for electric vehicle applications. The power flow can be bidirectional by connecting an active switch antiparallel with the diode in BQ-ZSI. The performance of the inverter under load variation can be improved by inserting an inner current control loop of the inductor in the QZSN side controller. Thus, a dedicated voltage controller with inductor current controller is designed to reject the disturbance and stabilize the dc-link voltage during a non-shoot through state. A 5-kW prototype has been built. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the validity of the circuit and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

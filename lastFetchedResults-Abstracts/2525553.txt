Background and objective: The number of patients with colostomy is increasing every day. Caring of patients with colostomy after operation should be based on different aspects of their quality of life (QoL). This study was conducted to determine the effect of telephone counseling (telenursing) by nurses on the QoL of patients with permanent colostomy.

Methods:&nbsp;This study was a randomized clinical trial with the control group. It was conducted on the patients of Iranian Ostomy Society, Tehran, Iran. At first, a total of 70 patients with permanent colostomy were selected by convenience sampling method and then allocated randomly in experimental group (with phone consultation) and control group. Patients in both groups followed training sessions as usual and participated in it. Data collection tool was City of Hope quality of life [COH-QOL]-Ostomy questionnaire. QoL was measured at the beginning of the intervention and then 16 weeks later. Statistical data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t test, independent t test, and analysis of covariance. Data analysis was performed by SPSS version 22.

Results: After telephone counseling, significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to physical (P= 0.007), mental-psychological (P˂ 0.001), and social (P˂ 0.001) aspects of patients&rsquo; QoL. Regarding the spiritual aspect of QoL, no significant difference was found between two groups (P= 0.111) after telephone counseling. All in all and compared with the control group, telephone counseling was significantly effective on the patients&rsquo; QoL (P˂ 0.001).

Conclusion: Because of telephone counseling was effective on physical, mental, and social aspects of patients&rsquo; QoL, the results of this study can be used to improve the QoL and the health of patients with colostomy.

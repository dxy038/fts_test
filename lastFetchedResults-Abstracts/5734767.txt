This paper focuses on the application of friction stir welding (FSW) as a joining process for aluminium metal matrix composite (MMC). FSW is known as a relatively new joining technique and in Malaysia the application of the technique is still in its infant stage. Among the advantages of this method compared to the conventional joining technique is that it reduces problem associated to metal re-solidification as the technique involves no melting stages. In addition the welding strength is higher; reduce in energy consumption and a longer tool life. Recently several substantial studies have been conducted to further extent the application of FSW. One of these studies is the application of FSW on newer materials such as aluminium MMC. This material has been chosen because of its ever expanding potential in the industry and its unique properties when compared to other materials. In the past, the material development was only focusing on the aerospace field applications, but recently the development of the material have been directed towards automotive, transportation, recreation and as well in the electronic industry. The objective of this paper is to analyze the microstructure and mechanical properties of the aluminium MMC joining through friction stir welding.

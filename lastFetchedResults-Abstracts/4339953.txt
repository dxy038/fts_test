As a key transformative technology in the 21st century, robot is playing an important role in hugely different working settings ranging from modern industry to social service. However, there is still a long way to go to improve its comprehensive performance through the research not only in intelligence but also in design. For a robotic system, the methodology of performance integration covers the measures from the multi-objective optimization to the integrated design and control. Component, Structure to System (CS2S) as a new paradigm is a significant extension and evolution from the concept of performance integration. Three case studies including the arm wrestling robotic system, modular reconfigurable robot and piano playing robot will be detailedly analyzed to prove the feasibility of the proposed methodology.

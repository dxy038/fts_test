Objective 
Considering the controversial results in present day literature regarding the 
relationship between febrile seizures and anemia and the high rate of such 
seizures in children, this study was conducted to evaluate the association 
between pediatric febrile seizures and anemia. 
Material and Methods 
In this case-control study, conducted in 2003, 60 children with febrile 
seizure(cases)  and 60 febrile children without seizure(controls) were evaluated 
in the Kashan Shahid Beheshti hospital; all patients were matched for age, 
sex, type of feeding, and use of supplemental iron. Thirty-six (60%) and 39 
(65%) of the patients in case and control groups respectively were male, and 
the remaining female. Levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell 
indices were determined in all children and Chi-square and Fisher exact tests 
were used to analyze data. 
Results
Of the case group, 13.3% (6 male, 2 female) and of controls, 20% (9 male, 3 
female) of children had anemia (p= 0.327), the condition being more common 
in male children aged over 6 months. Febrile seizures were found to occur 
mostly between the ages of 6 to 24 months.  
Conclusion
The risk of febrile seizure occurrence in anemic children seems to be less than 
that in children who do not suffer from the condition.

The utilization of wind energy has been the outmost energy objective of many countries in the EU in the past two decades. The low value of its reliability factor constitutes the biggest drawback for its use. The instability of wind speeds may lead to over-production of electricity from wind power generators at one time, and lack of production to satisfy demand at others. An energy carrier such as hydrogen would play a significant role in increasing the reliability of wind power generation systems.

are two objectives of this work; the first one is to investigate the possibility that hydrogen could be technically and economically produced by wind energy, according to up-to-now scientific research, in order to increase the wind energy penetration percentage in weak electric systems. A concise description of problems that result from wind integration in the systems of high wind penetration is enterprised, also referring to the existing solution suggestions, one of which is the production of hydrogen. The role of hydrogen in high wind penetration systems is described as well, and finally, a preliminary techno-economical case study of an electrolysis unit installation in an existing wind park in Crete island is also presented.

cond objective is to examine and analyse thermodynamically, the efficiency along the hydrogen and electricity production cycle, starting from the kinetic energy of the wind. The change of exergy due to losses at different points is being mapped and mathematically calculated. It is shown that there is a two fold change in exergetic efficiency along both paths. The same case study of the wind farm is taken as a system for examination.

e data used in this work come from Greece, specifically the island of Crete.

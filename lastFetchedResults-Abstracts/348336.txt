Objective
To investigate time-varying differences in visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) and dipoles elicited by high versus low spatial frequencies. The main question was whether different spatial frequencies are processed in distinct cortical areas, especially after 100 ms. An additional question was whether and how a hemispheric balance in spatial frequency processing develops over time.
Methods
Stimuli were square-wave gratings, with spatial frequencies of 0.75, 1.5, and 6 c/d. VEPs and dipole models were analyzed at various latencies.
Results
For the time-window of 80–100 ms, spatial frequency-related differences in VEPs and dipoles in posterior regions as reported previously were replicated: lower spatial frequencies were associated with more positivity in the VEP and with more anterior and radial sources than high frequencies. However, after 100 ms differences in amplitude, but not in topography and dipoles, were found between the different spatial frequencies. Between 180–200 ms a right hemisphere dominance was found for all frequencies.
Conclusions
After 100 ms, VEPs in response to different spatial frequencies seem to be generated in the same cortical areas. Also, no evidence for frequency-related hemispheric lateralization was found.
Significance
Insight is provided into the functional-anatomical basis of longer-latency frequency-related differences in processing

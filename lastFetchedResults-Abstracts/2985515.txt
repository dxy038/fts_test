Summary form only given. We have developed a laser stereolithography process associated to a Computer Aided Design to make layer by layer three-dimensional objects in polymer. Stereolithography (SL) is one of the most common methods of transforming computer aided design (CAD) data to obtain a solid. The part itself is built layer by layer in a vat of photocurable liquid monomer that hardens on light exposure. In the biomedical field, complex anatomical parts can be built by SL using medical imaging data (CT-Scanner or MRI). The hard three-dimensional models realization from scanographical data helps to give an understanding of the shape, orientation, relative location and size of internal structures and have been used for diagnosis, operation planning, design of implants and surgical templates. The availability of these models will furnish to surgeons a diagnostical and logistical tool particularly fruitful, especially for clinical complex cases. Now, our objective is to make implants directly by stereolithography based on a ceramic process fabrication using SL, i.e. by using the photopolymerization of a viscous mixture made of resin and hydroxyapatite and then followed by a sintering process to eliminate organic part

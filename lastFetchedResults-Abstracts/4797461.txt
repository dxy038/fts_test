Cloud Computing is one of the hottest topics researched today, with the objective of taking advantage of data center computational resources. Hardware and software virtualization make the environment scalable, redundant, and lower cost. This paper intends to characterize scientific and transactional applications in Cloud infrastructures IaaS, identifying the best virtual machine configuration in terms of the optimal processor allocation for executing parallel and distributed applications. Through the study, it was achieved 3 times improvements of the elapse time on scientific and transactional applications.

Emerging batteries based on Li-ion cells are of significant interest for aerospace, automotive, and utility energy storage systems because of their high energy density and low maintenance. Despite these and other advantages, there have been safety and certification issues, which have prevented widespread application of Li-ion batteries for aerospace applications. The main objective of this paper is to investigate a novel approach of Self-Regulated Low Voltage Active Electric Accumulator for a starter/generator system in a typical aircraft and compare its benefits and limitations to the existing battery technologies. Computer simulations will be presented to better understand feasibility and limitations of the proposed concept design.

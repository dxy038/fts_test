This paper proposes the application of fault-tolerant control (FTC) using weighted fuzzy predictive control. The FTC approach is based on two steps, fault detection and isolation (FDI) and fault accommodation. Fault detection is performed by a model-based approach using fuzzy modeling. Fault isolation uses a fuzzy decision making approach. The model of the isolated fault is used in fault accommodation with a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This paper uses a weighted fuzzy predictive control scheme, where fuzzy goals and fuzzy constraints are described in a fuzzy objective function. Each criterion (goal or constraint) has an associated weight factor, which is chosen by the decision-maker. Two faults were considered in an experimental three tanks process and the respective fuzzy models were identified. The fuzzy FTC scheme was able to accommodate the faults of the experimental process.

In this paper, a new method of improving the input current total harmonic distortion (THD) as well as power factor of a three-phase suppressed-link rectifier-inverter is presented. This proposed method makes use of a novel controlled diode rectifier. The technique involves the use of bidirectional switches across the front-end rectifier, and a dSPACE based intelligent control algorithm. The operation of the converter is fully analyzed and design example provided. The main feature of the topology is low cost, small size, high efficiency and simplicity, and is excellent for retrofitting front-end rectifier of existing ac drives, UPS etc.

Objective: The aim of the present study is to perform a systematic review of studies that have investigated the prevalence of sexual disorders in Iran. Method: A broad search was conducted in Pubmed Medline, ISI web of Science, PsychINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, and three Iranian databases, including IranPsych, IranMedex, and Scientific Information Database (SID). To cover those studies that were not published, we did a hand searching of all theses, reports and congresses abstract booklets which were available in IranPsych and universitiesâ€™ libraries. Then we included original studies which reported the prevalence of sexual disorders and data extraction was performed with two researchers for each document. Results: five studies were finally included, one in men and the others in women. There was a great heterogeneity between studies and performing metaanalysis was impossible. Conclusion: Prevalence rates of mental disorders were reported in a wide range in different studies. More high quality studies with standard instruments are necessary in this field.

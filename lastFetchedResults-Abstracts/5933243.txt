A goal of deregulation electric market is to impulse strengthening competition of new choices and economic benefits for utilities under constraints such as system reliability, stability, security and quality etc... The objective of operational issues would be to minimize the total system cost while satisfying all associated system constraints for the long-term generation and transmission expansion planning. This paper presents sensitivity analysis of transmission congestion by probabilistic reliability evaluation for KEPCO system. This paper focuses on transmission lines/transformers capacity constraints to be associated system load levels to impact on probabilistic reliability evaluation indices of bulk system. The sensitivity analysis of results is included in case studies. This paper suggests that the important input parameters can be determined optimally from this sensitivity analysis for high reliability level operation of a system. TRELSS program was used for the assessment tool

The TMLV Technology Program is concerned with the use of magnetic levitation for suspension of high-speed ground vehicles traveling at speeds of 480 km/h. The program is configured to permit comparative evaluation of two competing MAGLEV concepts -- repulsion and attraction. The program has two major tasks: conceptual design of a passenger-carrying system which meets a specified ride quality objective, and design and test of a high-speed (480 km/h) rocket-propelled test vehicle capable of providing engineering data relevant to the aforementioned conceptual design. The high-speed tests will be carried out at the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California. This paper will discuss both parts of the program, with emphasis on the superconducting magnets used in the levitation/guidance systems.

The objective of this paper is to discuss the possibility of reusing the existing hardware originally present in an analog application to implement test functions for a completely autonomous self-testable solution. In this first approach, a 8<sup>th</sup> order analog linear filter is used as an application example. The required modifications in the circuit are presented with the results in terms of area overhead and fault coverage

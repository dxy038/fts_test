Cartilage tissue engineering is emerging as a technique for the regeneration of cartilage tissue damaged due to disease or trauma. Since cartilage lacks regenerative capabilities, it is essential to develop approaches that deliver the appropriate cells, biomaterials, and signaling factors to the defect site. The objective of this review is to discuss the approaches that have been taken in this area, with an emphasis on various cell sources, including chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and stem cells. Additionally, biomaterials and their interaction with cells and the importance of signaling factors on cellular behavior and cartilage formation will be addressed. Ultimately, the goal of investigators working on cartilage regeneration is to develop a system that promotes the production of cartilage tissue that mimics native tissue properties, accelerates restoration of tissue function, and is clinically translatable. Although this is an ambitious goal, significant progress and important advances have been made in recent years.

This paper addresses the design of a model-based event-triggered strategy based on Sliding Mode Control (SMC), so that the overall proposal can be regarded as a networked control scheme. The objective is to reduce to a minimum the number of transmissions of the plant state over the network, in order to alleviate delays and packet loss induced by data transmission traffic. The key idea consists in using the actual system state or a suitably updated model state within the control law, depending on the magnitude of the sliding variable. More specifically, the model state is used within a boundary layer of the sliding manifold, so that a pseudo-equivalent control can be determined. This latter is continuous, which implies an intrinsic chattering alleviation capability of the proposed strategy. The designed networked scheme is assessed in simulation with satisfactory results.

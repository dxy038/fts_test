Objective: Melatonin is a scavenger agent that has been used to promote in vitro embryo
development. This
study was designed to show the effects
of melatonin on the

quality
and quantity rate of preimplantation mouse embryo development and pregnancy.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, super ovulated, mated mice were killed by cervical dislocation to collect two-cell zygotes from the oviduct of pregnant 1 day NMRI mice. Zygotes were cultured to the hatching blastocyst stage and the numbers of embryos at different stages were recorded under an inverted
microscope. The
cleavage rates of
two-cell
zygotes
were
assayed
until
the

blastocyst
and hatching blastocyst stage in drops of T6
medium that contained

either
melatonin (1, 10, and 100×10
6
, 10 and 100×10
 M) or no melatonin. The cell numbers of blastocysts were determined by differential staining, implantation outcomes were studied, and development and pregnancy rate were compared by the Chi-square (development) and Fisher’s exact (pregnancy rate) tests.

Results: The addition of 10 and 100 nM melatonin to the embryo culture media
promoted the development of the two-cell stage embryos to blastocyst and

hatching
blastocysts (p < 0.01) and caused a significant increase in total cell number
(TCN), trophoectoderm (TE), and inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocysts

(p < 0.01).
A
difference
was observed in the percentage of transferred embryos

that
were successfully implanted between the control and treatment groups

(p < 0.05).

Conclusion: The data indicate that 10 and 100 nM of melatonin positively impact mouse embryo cleavage rates, blastocyst TCN, and their implantation. Therefore,
melatonin at low concentrations promotes an embryonic culture system in

mice

The article deals with potential methodological approach for economical efficiency assessment of radio spectrum conversion for new mobile wireless technologies in the conditions of the limited released budgetary provisions. The task of choosing the conversion efficiency criterion was considered, the linear optimization model of conversion based on the procedural approach was proposed in the article. The issues concerning linearization of the objective function and limitation system for implementation of the linear programming approach to satisfy the radio spectrum conversion tasks were also addressed.

The last techniques concerning the treatment of industrial effluents lead to the membrane bioreactor, this one becomes integrated perfectly into an industrial process allowing a quasi-total reuse of waters (it is as well one of reasons that the membranes separation are very used in the industries). This reuse of wasted effluents allows the reducing of the manufacturing cost. The objective of our study is to determine the operating conditions to the operation of external membrane bioreactor for the treatment of waste of textile industry. The pilot-plant includes a reactor of 500 L in which develops an adapted biomass. The mixed liqueur is pumped from bioreactor to the membrane owing to a centrifugal pump. For the three considered feed outputs, the experimental have shown that the average dejection of the COD is of 97%, the rate of elimination of the ammoniac nitrogen is 70%, whatever is the age of sludge. A decrease observed of 70% of the color of the treated effluent. A pilot of mobile filtration was conceived to make out a will, in the conditions hydrodynamics controllable and similar to those of the membrane bioreactor, the filterability of the sludge.

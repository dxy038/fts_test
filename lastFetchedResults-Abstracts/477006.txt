There are large areas in arid regions having low rainfall and affected by land degradation due to change in environmental condition and anthropogenic activities (e. g. agricultural activities and mis-use of the land). Consequently, these fertile lands were changed into degraded and bare lands. agricultural activities such as unwise management of the land as well as inappropriate irrigation systems in many parts of arid and semi-arid regions of Iran has seriously led to land degradation and desertification. So, it is necessary to do some research in order to determine whether the region is suitable for agriculture or not and if suitable what type of agriculture management should be applied prevalently? To achieve this objective Taleghan region located in Tehran province was chosen. Investigation on the effects of agriculture management systems on land degradation carried out in 4 stages. At first, collection of basic information, such as soil data, agricultural productions, area of farmlands and preparing the slope and aspect maps by Digital Elevation Model. Change of some factors such as EC, SAR, pH, N, P, K, and humus were also measured in soil surface (0-30 cm) according to split plot design. Six different series of soil were then recognized and 6 treatments with 6 replications including dry farming systems, mono- cultivated and multi- cultivated systems under irrigation, orchards, eroded lands and rangelands as control treatments were considered. The results showed that there were significant differences among treatments (agricultural lands). The comparison of treatments mean values with Duncanâ€™s test indicated dry farming system and eroded lands as the most unsuitable treatments and multi cultivated lands as the most suitable one in this region.

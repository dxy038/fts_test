Many practical engineering optimization problems involve discrete or integer design variables, and often the design decisions are to be made in a fuzzy environment in which the statements might be vague or imprecise. A mixed-discrete fuzzy nonlinear programming approach that combines the fuzzy (lambda)-formulation with a hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed in this paper. This method can find a globally compromise solution for a mixed-discrete fuzzy optimization problem, even when the objective function is nonconvex and nondifferentiable. In the construction of the objective membership function, an error from the early research work is corrected and the right conclusion has been made. The illustrative examples demonstrate that more reliable and satisfactory results can be obtained through the present method.

Deploying a number of femtocells to jointly provide coverage in an enterprise environment raises critical challenges especially in future self-organizing networks which rely on plug-and-play fashions. This paper presents a technique based on the genetic algorithm for a centralized self-optimizing network containing a group of femtocells. Depending on a multi-objective function for optimizing the coverage, the algorithm leads to a dynamic update of the pilot powers of the group of femtocells. The results show the ability of the algorithm to effectively optimize the coverage according to the global traffic distribution and the levels of interference between neighboring femtocells.

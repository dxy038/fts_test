In this paper, the authors make optimization to multi-objective function of cognitive radio with the help of quantum genetic algorithm(QGA) based on clonal selection. And a clonal selection quantum (CSQ) has been put forward by quantum genetic algorithm and immune clonal selection, and the algorithm have been improved. It produces encouraging results when we apply the algorithm to the function optimization of cognitive radio with the introduction of simulation in the dynamic parameter set-up.

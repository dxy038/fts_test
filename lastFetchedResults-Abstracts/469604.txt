Objective
Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific protein that has been found to be associated with insulin sensitivity and obesity. Because gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with obesity and decreased insulin sensitivity, we have analyzed plasma adiponectin levels in women with gestational diabetes mellitus.
Study design
Twenty women with gestational diabetes mellitus and 21 unaffected women were included in the study. Plasma adiponectin levels were analyzed with the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
Women with gestational diabetes mellitus were significantly older (34.3 years vs 29.4 years; P< .001) than unaffected women. Adiponectin plasma levels were significantly lower in women with gestational diabetes mellitus when compared with women without gestational diabetes mellitus (5827 ± 1988 ng/mL vs 8085 ± 3816 ng/mL; P = .02). Adiponectin plasma levels were correlated negatively with plasma glucose concentrations of the oral glucose tolerance test (r > −0.38; P< .04) and correlated positively with gestational age (r = 0.36; P = .03).
Conclusion
Our data show that decreased plasma adiponectin levels were found in women with gestational diabetes mellitus compared with unaffected women.

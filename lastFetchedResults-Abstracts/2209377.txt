This paper concerns a study on the optimal control for nonlinear systems. An appropriate alternative in order to alleviate the nonlinearity of a system is the exact linearization approach. In this fashion, the nonlinear system has been linearized using input-output feedback linearization (IOFL). Then, by utilizing the well developed optimal control theory of linear systems, the compensated nonlinear system has been controlled. Thus, the structure of the objective function will be converted into a quadratic form which is qualitativly comparable with usual cost functions, and from operating viewpoint is more favorable. To qualify such a procedure, it has been applied to two minimum and nonminimum-phase chemical processes, and its performance is verified through computer simulations.

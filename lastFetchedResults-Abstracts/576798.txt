Abstract:
Background and objectives: There is a great interest in photocatalytic
oxidation of contaminants, using ZnO, in recent years. The main objective
of this research was to study photocatalytic disinfection of E. coli bacteria
as water microbial pollution index, using nanoparticles of ZnO and a UV
lamp in a batch reactor.
Material and Methods: In this study, the contaminated water sample was
prepared through adding 102 and 103 E. coli bacteria per ml of raw water.
The contaminated water entered the photocatalytic oxidation reactor and
removal efficiency of E. coli bacteria in different conditions were studied,
including pH (5.5, 7, and 9), time (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 mins), dose of
nano particles ZnO (0.2,0.4,0.8 and 1 gr/l), number of bacterium (102 and
103 per milliliter) and voltage of UV-C lamp, 27 volts. Characterizations of
ZnO nano particles were determined using scanning electron microscope
equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX) system and X-ray
diffraction (XRD) method.
Results: Photocatalytic process efficiency is enhanced by increasing
reaction time and dose of nano particles ZnO in the presence of UV lamp
irradiation. The results show that the best conditions for removal of 102 and
103 bacteria per milliliter are obtained from condition including pH of 7,
reaction time of 30 mins, 0.8 gr/l doses of nano particles ZnO and 27-volt-
UV lamp.
Conclusion: The results indicate that the increase of reaction time and
dose of nano particles ZnO, in the presence of radiation UV lamp, have the
most significant effect on photocatalytic efficiency. Based on the results,
photocatalytic can be promising method for removal of E. coli bacterium
from drinking water.

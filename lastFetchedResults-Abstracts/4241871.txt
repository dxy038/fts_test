This paper proposes two reduced switch count AC/AC converters. The proposed topologies allow single-phase to three-phase and three-phase to three-phase power conversion. The converters provide bidirectional power flow and power factor control. The pulse-width modulation techniques and the control strategies for providing unity power factor operation are investigated. Experimental and simulated results are presented.

The mobile networks are every day more commonand useful, but the costs involved in its management are high. The location area partitioning is a strategy of location management that tries to minimize the involved costs. In this paper we present a new approach based on differential evolution algorithm applied to the location area partitioning, as a cost optimization problem. We use realistic dat for generating the test networks. This work has the objective of defining the best values to the differential evolution (DE) parameters and setting the DE scheme, which allows us to obtain better results when compared to classical strategies and the other authorsÂ´ results. The best solution is obtained after the development of four distinct experiments, each one applied to one of the differential evolution parameters. The final results obtained by this approach are very good.

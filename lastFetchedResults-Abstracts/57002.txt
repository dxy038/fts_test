Confocal laser scanning microscopy now has so many functions and applications that choosing a new multiuser confocal laser microscopy system can be a daunting task, particularly for a first-time buyer and new users of confocal microscopy. How does one determine which features are most appropriate for any particular laboratory, application, or imaging environment? Each confocal microscopy system has its own individual advantages and limitations, which ultimately defines its market niche. Here, we describe the features that differentiate the four confocal microscopy systems we assessed. The decisive factors in choosing a confocal microscopy system for our anatomical laboratory were user-friendly software for on-line acquisition and off-line processing; the working distances of objective lenses; applicability for a multiuser environment; interactions with company representatives; and turnaround times for questions, service, and accessories.

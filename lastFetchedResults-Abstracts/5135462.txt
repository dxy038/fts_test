Two fundamental problems in any cellular systems are limited capacity and the presence of unbalanced traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel grouping infrastructure for next generation cellular networks, whose objective is to increase the system throughput and further improve the system balance. In the cellular system, we consider all the available users are divided into two groups. One is the super group which locates in the cell central region, and another is the regular group which locates in the cell boundary. The super group is served by Base Station, and the Mobile Stations locate in the cell boundary are served by the clusterhead which is elect from the regular group. By using the grouping scheme, itÂ´s possible to improve the system performance in terms of SINR cumulative distribution function, system throughput and cell boundary throughput. Results show that good SINR is achieved, as well as significant gains in the whole cell throughput compared to the conventional cellular system.

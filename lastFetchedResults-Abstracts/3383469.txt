In this paper, the prototype development of a wrist-worn integrated health monitoring device (WIHMD) with tele-reporting function for emergency telemedicine and home telecare for the elderly is reported. The WIHMD consists of six vital biosignal measuring modules, which include a fall detector, a single-channel electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), respiration rate, and body surface temperature measuring units. The size of the WIHMD is 60times50times20 mm, except the wrist cuff, and the total system weighs 200 g, including two 1.5-V AAA-sized batteries. The functional objective of the WIHMD is to provide information concerning current condition, such as vital biosignals and locational information, with compromised fidelity to experts at a distance through the commercial cellular phone network. The developed system will provide the facility for rapid and appropriate directions to be given by experts in emergency situations and will enable the user or caregiver to manage changes in health condition with helpful treatment

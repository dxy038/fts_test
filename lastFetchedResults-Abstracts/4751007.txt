This paper <sup>1</sup> discusses an objective image blur measurement in no reference based on wavelet high frequency domain analysis. It provides one novel statistical feature extraction for wavelet domain description, which is related with measuring score in a power law through NLREG. Evaluating the model by one carefully built database, it obtains correlation rate at 0.95 as human subjective scores, better than TongÂ´s method about 5 points.

It is the major objective of this paper to present the use of multicomputer configurations in the dispatch of real power in power pools. It is shown that the area dispatch computers, upon the formation of power pools, can form a multicomputer configuration. The characteristics of such a configuration are outlined and a computer hierarchy presented. Both the single-area as well as the multiarea approaches to the power dispatch problem are formulated and their associated modeling described. A number of novel methods for the instant-by-instant dispatch of real power are given. Three multiarea methods are described in detail which have been called 1) pool boundary cost iteration method, 2) pool ??ratio method, and 3) pool base point and participation factor method.

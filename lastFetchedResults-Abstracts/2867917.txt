Different kinds of sequential optimization strategies have been developed and employed for the design optimization of electromagnetic devices and systems in recent years, such as electrical machines and superconducting magnetic energy storage system. Besides the traditional low dimensional and single objective problems, they can be employed for high dimensional and multiobjective design optimization problems. Meanwhile, they can significantly reduce the computation cost of finite element analysis and improve the optimization efficiency. This paper aims to present a state of art of sequential optimization strategies for single and multi-objective electromagnetic optimization problems. Furthermore, a fast sequential sampling method is presented based on the framework of sequential optimization. Future work about sequential optimization and related research topics will be proposed as well.

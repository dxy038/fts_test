In this case study, a conflict resolution procedure with the support of a mediator is reported. The conflicting interests were those of coastal protection1 on the one hand and those of nature conservation on the other hand. Provoked by a major political conflict over a project of dyke reinforcement, the state Minister convened a group of stakeholders to develop proposals for better interaction and management of coastal protection issues. Appreciating the successful results, the Minister then mandated the group to develop a recommendation for legislation.
This paper illustrates the issues at stake, the value conflict shaping the stakeholdersâ€™ positions, the setting of the mediation group and the way to proceed improving the relationships between the actors and successfully building consensus recommendations. The process to overcome impasse by mediation exemplarily is reported in some more detail for the law making objective.

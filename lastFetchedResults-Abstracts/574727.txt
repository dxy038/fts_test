Introduction & Objective: Before using multi hook segmental fixation in schuerman kyphosis (S.K) surgery, instrumentation by harington rod(H.R) was common. 
Materials & Methods: In this study we evaluated the complication and pre and post surgical kyphosis in  26S.K patients who had anterior release and anterior fusion and then halofemoral traction and finally posterior fusion and insrumentation by harington compression rod  ,in shafa yahyaian hospital from 1976 till 2001.All of their document are available in hospital archive and have minimum acceptable follow up .
Results: No major complication was noted. one infection and one harington rod fracture was noted, which they cured by appropreriate treatment. Mean degree of thoracic kyphosis was 94 and after surgery was 43.
Conclusion: It seems that most prominent failure was overcorrection after surgery, so sometimes it reached to below 35 degree.

Objective: It is postulated that ritalin may adversely affect sleep,
appetite, weight and growth of some children with ADHD. Therefore, we
aimed to evaluate melatonin supplementation effects on dietary intake,
growth and development of children with ADHD treated with ritalin
through circadian cycle modification and appetite mechanisms .
Method: After obtaining consent from parents, 50 children aged 7-12
with combined form of AD/HD were randomly divided into two groups
based on gender blocks: one received melatonin (3 or 6 mg based on
weight) combined with ritalin (1mg/kg) and the other took placebo
combined with ritalin (1mg/kg) in a double blind randomized clinical trial.
Three-day food record, and standard weight and height of children were
evaluated prior to the treatment and 8 weeks after the treatment.
Children’s appetite and sleep were evaluated in weeks 0, 2, 4 and 8.
Hypotheses were then analyzed using SPSS17.
Results: Paired sample t-test showed significant changes in sleep
latency (23.15±15.25 vs. 17.96±11.66; p=0.047) and total sleep
disturbance score (48.84±13.42 vs. 41.30±9.67; p=0.000) before and
after melatonin administration, respectively. However, appetite and food
intake did not change significantly during the study. Sleep duration and
appetite were significantly correlated in melatonin group (Pearson
r=0.971, p=0.029). Mean height (138.28±16.24 vs. 141.35±16.78;
P=0.000) and weight (36.73±17.82 vs. 38.97±17.93; P=0.005) were
significantly increased in melatonin treated children before and after the
trial .
Conclusion: Administration of melatonin along with ritalin improves height and weight growth of children. These effects may be attributed to circadian cycle modification, increasing sleep duration and the consequent more growth hormone release during sleep.

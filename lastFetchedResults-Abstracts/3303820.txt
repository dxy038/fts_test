With fierce competition in the electronic product market, a manufacturer needs to constantly improve the quality of their products. Therefore, in recent years, many sound quality analysis tools have been developed to help them to judge the quality of products. In this paper, we focus on the need for evaluating the sound quality of recording product. The system we proposed is a technical tool that is based on objective measurements, or metrics. The metrics mainly include linearity, frequency response, directivity, harmonic distortion. In the process, a standard sound signal is recorded by various recording devices. To compare and analyze the recorded signals and the original signal, the differences on metrics are obtained. In the objective tests, the quality evaluation of various devices is in according with the differences. The use of the system is discussed and an example is given. Experiments indicate that our proposed system can accurately realize the device evaluation.

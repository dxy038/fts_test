In the present work Selective Harmonic Elimination Pulse Width Modulation (SHE-PWM) based on Particle Swarm Optimization is proposed for the enhancement of the H-Bridge multilevel inverter output voltage quality. The problem of the SHE-PWM is presented by a constrained nonlinear objective function which has to be minimized. The main aim is the calculation of the switching angles vector solution representing the best minimal value for the objective function. The results obtained with the present application show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

SummaryObjective:
estigate whether there is a difference in the density of Merkel cells between the gingiva of dentate and edentate subjects.
s:
ndred and two blocks of human mandibular (n = 55) and maxillary (n = 47) gingiva from 69 white skinned individuals (44 males, 25 females, mean age 70.1 years, range 42–92 years) were analysed. Twenty-six individuals had teeth remaining in at least one jaw (mean age of dentate 64.5 years, edentate 72.1 years), of which 15 were dentate in both jaws. Overall, 24/55 mandibles and 17/47 maxillae were dentate. Five micrometer sections were stained with a monoclonal antibody to cytokeratin 20 (CK20) using standard immunoperoxidase or immunoalkaline phosphatase methods. Positive cells were counted in 20 consecutive high power fields using the ×40 objective in three sections from each biopsy, and the results analysed for differences related to age, sex, site and presence of teeth.
s:
ositive Merkel cells were present either singly or in clusters in the basal epithelial layers, particularly at the tips of rete ridges. Numbers of gingival Merkel cells were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.005, Mann–Whitney) in edentate (cells per field mean, median, standard deviation, respectively: 1.39, 0.64, and 1.85) when compared to dentate (0.67, 0.20, and 1.21) specimens. The differences were not statistically significant for any other variable.
sion:
ta raise the possibility that reduced perception following loss of teeth may be compensated for by an increase in the local Merkel cell population.

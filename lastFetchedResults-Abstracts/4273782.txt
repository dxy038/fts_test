In this study, an extended idea has been introduced to improve the dynamic response of single-phase active power factor correction (PFC) converter. A highly non-linear DC-DC converter with inherent parameter uncertainties and the harmful effects due to large disturbance in line voltage are tackled by proposed two sided latched pulse-width-modulation technique with sophisticated feedback system. The effort is made to achieve improvement in the dynamic response of active PFC converter with the primary objective of achieving nearly unity input power factor. The dynamic performance of the proposed converter is analyzed in Power Sim (PSIM) package and is exactly verified with 400 V, 500 W, and 100 kHz laboratory prototype for step change in input voltage and load current.

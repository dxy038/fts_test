A fixed-charge model subject to a system of fuzzy relation inequalities with max-product composite operator is presented. The feasible domain of the model is first investiged of which the necessary and sufficient condition is proposed. If it is infeasible, a minimum calibration procedure is provided to have at least one solution. Due to the nonconvexity of its feasible domain, a solution procedure is designed to have a minimum objective value of which the initial cost is considered. An illustrative example is presented.

The Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) community is increasingly recognizing the inherit &#8220;multiobjectiveness&#8221; in Software Engineering problems. The old ways of aggregating all objectives into one may very well be behind us. We perform a well-deserved literature survey of SBSE papers that used multiobjective search to find Pareto-optimal solutions, and we pay special attention to the chosen algorithms, tools, and quality indicators, if any. We conclude that the SBSE field has seen a trend of adopting the Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms (MEOAs) that are widely used in other fields (such as NSGA-II and SPEA2) without much scrutiny into the reason why one algorithm should be preferred over the others. We also find that the majority of published work only tackled two-objective problems (or formulations of problems), leaving much to be desired in terms of exploiting the power of MEOAs to discover solutions to intractable problems characterized by many trade-offs and complex constraints.

According to the solution to transcendental equation for selective harmonic elimination inverter is difficult, a method of solution to switching angles based on the rapid expansion of cos(n&#945;) was presented. The SHET transcendental equation has been simplified by the law of rapid expansion of cos(n&#945;).This method enlarges the range of initial switching angles and there is no divergence or singular value in the solution to transcendental equation. The optimization for switching angles is available though designing objective function .The results of experiment show that the method of solving switching angles proposed is correctness.

We present a continuous 3D face authentication system that uses a RGB-D camera to monitor the accessing user and ensure that only the allowed user uses a protected system. At the best of our knowledge, this is the first system that uses 3D face images to accomplish such objective. By using depth images, we reduce the amount of user cooperation that is required by the previous continuous authentication works in the literature. We evaluated our system on four 40 minutes long videos with variations in facial expressions, occlusions and pose, and an equal error rate of 0.8% was achieved.

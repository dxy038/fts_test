Voice conversion (VC) is a process which modifies the speech signal produced by one source speaker so that it sounds like another target speaker. In this paper the transformation is determined by using equal Arabic utterances from source and target speakers. A conversion function based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used for transforming the spectral envelope described by Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). The quality of the transformed utterances is measured using subjective and objective evaluations.

This project consists in the installation of four photovoltaic subgenerators connected to the low voltage grid at Jaen University Campus (Spain), with a total power of 200 kWp. The Univer Project is developed under the Thermie Programme of the EU, with a budget of about 1.8 M euros. The main objective is the integration of a medium scale PV plant using different architectural solutions. This project presents two innovative aspects: on the one hand, the development of the technology necessary to implement medium-high scale PV plants in crowded places, mainly focused on safety and protection systems; on the other, the development and analysis of different architectural solutions to integrate PV generators using constructive structures easily replicable

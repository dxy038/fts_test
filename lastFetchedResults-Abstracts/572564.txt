Abstract
Aim: The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of two peaks exercise training program during one week on some hepatic stress indexes (AST, ALT) in active girls.
Method: Twelve physical education girl students with ranged between 16-18 years old and mean maximal oxygen consumption 35.2Â±3.4 ml/kg/min, was selected and divided randomly into an experimental (n=7) and control (n=5) groups. The subjects in the experimental group performed two peaks exercise training program during one week with 70%, 80%, and 90% VO2max intensities in the first three days and repeated in late three days. The control group did not perform any physical activity while the research was underway. Venous blood samples were obtained for analysis before the exercise and the 24 hours after one, 3, 6 days exercise sessions. Data were analyzed by using ANOVA with repeated measure test and independent t-test at significant levels p < 0.05.
Results: The result of this study indicated that the value of AST increased progressively with increasing number of exercise sessions (p < 0.05). In addition, the value of ALT was elevated significantly after 24 hours of 1, 3 and 6 days of training protocols (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: According to the effect of two peaks, training program on increase the release of hepatic enzymes, that may be acute by lack of adequate recovery, we speculated that 24 h recovery period followed by a two peaks training program could not be sufficient for compensation of cellular and sub cellular demands regarding to different exercise intensities.

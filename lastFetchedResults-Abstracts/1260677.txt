 Paradoxical vocal fold dysfunction (PVFD) is a complex disorder of the larynx that primarily affects breathing. To date, no study has focused on the patient's own perception of how their quality of life related to voice is affected by the diagnosis of PFVD. The objective of this study is to characterize the self-reported voice-related quality of life (VR-QOL) patients diagnosed with PVFD using the Pediatric Voice Outcomes Survey (PVOS) instrument; an additional objective was to assess for the presence of any associations between laryngeal findings, concomitant medical disorders, and PVOS measures. The method used was a retrospective chart review. Twenty patients are identified in the study period; there were 17 females (mean age 14 years) and three males (mean age 11 years). The mean PVOS scores are uniformly normal for the subset of boys (nآ =آ 3, mean PVOS 100). The mean PVOS for the 17 females was 89 (SD, 12.8), lower than that measured in healthy, age-matched females (nآ =آ 13) who had a mean PVOS of 95 (SD, 7.4). The difference between these two groups was not statistically significant (Pآ <آ 0.17, unpaired t test). Although the absolute PVOS scores were affected by observed laryngeal abnormalities, asthma history, or reflux history, the absence of any of these were significantly more likely to be associated with a perfect score on the PVOS. The overall PVOS does not show a significant decline in the self-reported VR-QOL. Several cofactors may be associated with the detectable but not significant reduction in the PVOS scores for the females in this study.

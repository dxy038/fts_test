The objective of this research was to design and develop the Epidemiological Investigation and Intelligent Analytical System for foodborne disease to improve the ability to control foodborne disease events in field epidemiological investigations. The system is composed of standard electronic investigation questionnaires for collecting data from field investigations, a statistical analysis module integrated with statistically programmed methods for calculating odds and risk ratios for risk factors, an intelligent auxiliary diagnosis module featuring a feedback function able to enhance diagnostic accuracy, and a knowledge database for acquiring information in areas related to foodborne disease. The system has been provided to the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army Emergency Response Team for public health events. In field experiments, the system was very effective and improved work efficiency in epidemiological investigations of foodborne disease.

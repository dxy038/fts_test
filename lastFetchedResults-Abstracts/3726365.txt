In this paper, we develop a new unified approach for laser radar range anomaly suppression, range profiling, and segmentation. This approach combines an object-based hybrid scene model for representing the range distribution of the field and a statistical mixture model for the range data measurement noise. The image segmentation problem is formulated as a minimization problem which jointly estimates the target boundary together with the target region range variation and background range variation directly from the noisy and anomaly-filled range data. This formulation allows direct incorporation of prior information concerning the target boundary, target ranges, and background ranges into an optimal reconstruction process. Curve evolution techniques and a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm are jointly employed as an efficient solver for minimizing the objective energy, resulting in a coupled pair of object and intensity optimization tasks. The method directly and optimally extracts the target boundary, avoiding a suboptimal two-step process involving image smoothing followed by boundary extraction. Experiments are presented demonstrating that the proposed approach is robust to anomalous pixels (missing data) and capable of producing accurate estimation of the target boundary and range values from noisy data.

In this paper, a backstepping controller is presented for the tracking control of work platform of folding-boom aerial platform vehicle. The control objective is to suppress the vibration and drive the work platform to follow a desired reference trajectory. According to the Lyapunov stability theorem, the derived control law guarantees that the trajectory tracking system is exponentially asymptotically stable. In other words, the trajectory of work platform can follow the desired trajectory without vibration. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the performance of the proposed controller is excellent. Not only can the controller suppress the vibration, but also it can eliminate the trajectory tracking error of work platform. Therefore, the work platform can keep the steady movement following the desired trajectory.

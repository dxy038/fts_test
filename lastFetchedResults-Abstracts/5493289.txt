In this paper we present a new MAI (multiple access interference) resistant CDMA multiuser detector based on digital signal processing (DSP) and a neural network (NN). Using a proper relationship between the objective function of the optimization problem and the energy function of the NN together with hardware annealing and a DSP preprocessing stage, this detector exhibits a number of attractive properties: low complexity, low computational cost, MAI resistance, and near-far resistance

The objective of this paper is to elucidate the influence of fatty glyceride chain length in chitosan copolymers on the peroral absorption of enoxaparin. First of all, a series of chitosan copolymers with glyceryl monocaprylate (GM8), glyceryl monolaurate (GM12) and glyceryl monostearate (GM18) as the hydrophobic part were synthesized. The structure of the copolymers was characterized using proton nuclear magnetic resonance. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay demonstrated that all the copolymers were non-toxic. Enoxaparin nanocomplexes were prepared by self-assembly. Mucoadhesion of the nanocomplexes was characterized using the mucin particle method. Nanocomplex uptake and transport were quantified in Caco-2 cells and cellular localization was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Enoxaparin uptake was enhanced by nanocomplex formation, and was dependent on incubation time, concentration, temperature and glyceride chain length. The GM8 grafted chitosanâ€“enoxaparin nanocomplex exhibited the strongest bioadhesion and the best uptake and transport in both cell culture and in vivo absorption in rats. The uptake mechanism was assumed to be adsorptive endocytosis via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated processes. In conclusion, oral absorption of enoxaparin can be further enhanced by using GM8 grafted chitosan copolymer as the carrier to form nanocomplexes.

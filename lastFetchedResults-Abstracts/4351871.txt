This paper deals with a detailed systematic methodology to design power and ground distribution networks in low power ASICs. A design flow for determining the width of each branch in the power and ground networks meeting the design requirements is presented, along with a design example, where the objective is to minimize the area of the power and ground networks for several given constraints such as IR drop and EM. This methodology was applied to a low power speech recognition ASIC design and was successfully verified.

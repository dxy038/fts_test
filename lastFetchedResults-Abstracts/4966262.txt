Summary Form only given, as follows. The plasma diagnostics for the proposed ignition experiment IGNITEX are presented. The IGNITEX device will be a compact, ohmically heated tokamak. The objective is to produce an ignited D-T plasma for scientific study in a cost-effective way, using very high (20 T) toroidal magnetic fields. The field will be provided by a single-turn copper coil that completely encloses the plasma vessel limiting access to the plasma for diagnostics. The diagnostics for the experiments are divided into two categories. The initial set, used in the preignited phase, includes a Thomson scattering system for electron temperature measurements, a far-infrared interferometer for electron density measurements, a set of spectrometers (visible and UV) for impurity studies, a set of magnetic pickup coils for basic plasma parameter monitoring and feedback control, and an electron-cyclotron-emission system for additional electron temperature measurement. The diagnostics for use during the ignited phase must be hardened against radiation damage. The set is the same as specified above with some modifications. Two additional types of diagnostics will be added during the ignited phase to monitor the fusion products (neutrons and alpha particles).&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

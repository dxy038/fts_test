Although, impairments following sleep deprivation have been clearly demonstrated in the literature, researchers have found a wide range of individual variation in response to sleep deprivation. The relationship between personality and the subjective and objective impact of sleep deprivation was examined using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, Sleep Hygiene Index, Profile of Mood States, an oddball reaction time test, a multi-task cognitive performance battery (SynWin), and the NEO Personality Inventory Revised. Subjects (14 males, 14 females, mean age 20.5) were sleep deprived for 28â€“35 h and during this time were allowed access to self-reported typical amounts of tobacco, caffeine, and food. Post sleep deprivation: (a) higher neuroticism scores were related to participants feeling sleepier, experiencing more mood disturbance, and performing inferiorly on a behavioral task; (b) subjects scoring as introverts showed more compromised behavioral performance compared to extraverts. The authors suggest that potential moderating variables of the relationship between personality and sleep deprivation such as stimulant use, food intake, and socialization warrant further investigation.

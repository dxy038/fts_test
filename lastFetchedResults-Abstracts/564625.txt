We have been witnesses to import of numerous premixes produced by various producers and of different quality in regard to concentration of ingredients which are their main components. In our previous studies (Zivkovic et al., 2010) we obtained results confirming that in use of domestic premix more economically efficient production is realized in nutrition of sows and piglets, so this research was carried out with objective to verify the effects of several different imported premixes and those produced according to domestic concept, in nutrition of growing-fattening pigs. Research was performed on private farm in the vicinity of Sabac in Serbia. Nutrition of fattening pigs using mixture which contained adequate premix of domestic production improved the growth rate by 7.6% without any significant difference in food conversion. Cost of feed when domestic premixes were used in nutrition of fattening pigs was by 4.1% lower and value of realized pigs by approx. 4.51% more favourable when domestic premixes were used in nutrition of investigated animals. Dressing percentage of pigs on domestic premixes was higher by 2.0%, and there was no difference in meatiness between compared groups of animals in the experiment. In general, obtained results showed that use of both types of compared premixes can be recommended, but it is more economically efficient to use domestic premixes in nutrition of fattening pigs.

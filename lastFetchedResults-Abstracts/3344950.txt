Residential and commercial buildings consume more than 40% of electrical power and contribute a large percentage of CO2 and SO2. In order to alleviate energy crises and environment deterioration, improving energy efficiency of buildings has become significant and important. This paper considers the storage battery scheduling problem in a networked building microgrid with decentralized solar power and storage battery. First, we formulate an optimization model with minimizing overall electricity cost as the objective. Then we use a linearization technique to simplify the model and reformulate the optimization problem as a deterministic programming and further a stochastic programming with scenario tree being used to handle the uncertainties of solar power and building load. At last, test results of a toy model verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide insight on power scheduling in a networked microgrid for improving building energy efficiency.

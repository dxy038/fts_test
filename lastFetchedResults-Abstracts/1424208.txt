Production of Z-type farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) has not been reported in Escherichia coli. Here we present the fusion enzyme (ILRv) of E. coli E,E-FPP synthase (IspA) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Z,E-FPP synthase (Rv1086), which can produce primarily Z,E-FPP rather than E,E-FPP, the predominant stereoisomer found in most organisms. Z,E-farnesol (FOH) was produced from E. coli harboring the bottom portion of the MVA pathway and the fusion FPP synthase (ILRv) at a titer of 115.6 mg/L in 2 YT medium containing 1% (v/v) glycerol as a carbon source and 5 mM mevalonate. The Z,E-FOH production was improved by 15-fold, compared with 7.7 mg/L obtained from the co-overexpression of separate IspA and Rv1086. The Z,E-FPP was not metabolized in native metabolic pathways of E. coli. It would be of interest to produce Z,E-FPP derived sesquiterpenes from recombinant E. coli due to no loss of Z,E-FPP substrate in endogenous metabolism of the host strain.

This paper analyzes and presents impact of two types of the objective image quality assessment measures, no-reference and full-reference measures, on perception quality of 3D image using fuzzy logic estimator namely the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy model. Based on the choice of two types of modelÂ´s inputs, a comparative analysis is performed in this paper. All parameters of the no-reference and full-reference Takagi-Sugeno-Kang models are optimized in accordance to the selected sets mapping criteria of the input objective quality measures to the corresponding Differential Mean Opinion Scores (DMOS).

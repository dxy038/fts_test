This work deals with a parametric identification using the least square method based on the output error. An appropriate particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied as a technique to minimize the objective function in order to obtain simultaneously the electrical and the mechanical parameters. The validation and comparison of the two algorithms used are obtained from experiments carried out on different machines.

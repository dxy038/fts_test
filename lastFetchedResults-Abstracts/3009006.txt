In this paper, we propose a novel digital watermarking scheme based on fuzzy-ART to adapt the embedding strength of the watermark according to the spatial features of the host image. The method allows a visually recognizable binary image to be used as the watermark. To further enhance the robustness of the watermark, a weighted-recovery technique is also developed. Besides subjective evaluation, objective normalized correlation is also used to detect the presence of the watermark. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques can survive several kinds of image processing attacks and the JPEG lossy compression.

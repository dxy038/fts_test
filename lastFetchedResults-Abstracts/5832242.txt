A novel approach to find optimal real power generation pattern will be introduced in this study. This has been achieved by maximizing the power system voltage stability margin and minimizing generation cost. The loadability limit index is used to assess static voltage stability security margin. Based on proposed algorithm, a Toolbox has been developed to recognize the loadability limit by using Lagrangian method. The mentioned problem has been modeled as a non-linear and multi objective optimization problem along with Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (HGAPSO) method to reach the optimal generation pattern. The method has been performed as a hierarchical optimization problem. In the first stage, HGAPSO method has been used to reach the securest pattern of real power. Also, mentioned voltage stability toolbox has been executed to evaluate the voltage stability margin respectively each real power generation pattern during HGAPSO search. These simulations are performed on IEEE 30 bus test system. To validation of proposed method, obtained results have been compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) results.

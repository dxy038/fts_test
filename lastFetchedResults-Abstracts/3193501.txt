It is important to choose the voltage level of the mid-voltage distribution network objectively and accurately. An integrated model to choose the voltage level of the mid-voltage distribution network was proposed in this paper, in which analytical hierarchy process (AHP) comprehensive evaluation method to conduct a comprehensive evaluation was introduced. The model includes 5 indexs, such as economy, technology, society, environment and the restriction, and every index has its criterion level. With AHP method, establishing the judgment matrix, and calculating the weights, the coherence verification of integrating effects and the calculation of combined weights are conducted to see the effect of different alternatives in the decision-making. So it is objective and accurate to choose the voltage level of the mid-voltage distribution network. Examples are shown that the method is practicable for its simple calculations.

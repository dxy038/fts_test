Objective
The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature of studies that examined the association between factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin gene variant and intrauterine growth restriction.
Study design
This systematic review of studies assesses the association between factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin gene variant and intrauterine growth restriction.
Results
Ten case-control studies fulfilled the selection criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. There was a significant association between factor V Leiden and intrauterine growth restriction (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.5) and prothrombin gene variant and intrauterine growth restriction (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-5.0). Five cohort studies were identified in the systematic review; 3 studies were prospective (2 full publications), and 2 studies were retrospective (1 full publication). Combining the 2 full publication prospective studies yields a summary relative risk of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.5-1.9).
Conclusion
This meta-analysis of case-control studies suggests that the factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene variant both confer an increased risk of giving birth to an intrauterine growth restricted infant, although this may be driven by small, poor-quality studies that demonstrated extreme associations. Large well-conducted prospective cohort studies are required to determine definitively whether an association between thrombophilia and intrauterine growth restriction is present.

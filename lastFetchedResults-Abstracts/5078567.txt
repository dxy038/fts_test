It is very important to improve noise immunity in ultrasonic nondestructive testing systems. This objective is achieved by reflected signal de-noising. The wavelets transform based methods are widely used for noise reduction in recent time. Effectiveness of the wavelets transform based de-noising procedure depends on the signal to noise ratio. The signal to noise ratio in a non-destructive testing system depends not only on the noise level, but also on the length of the signal to be processed. Reducing the length of the signal to be processed may increase noise immunity. sliding windows allow reducing the length of the signal to be processed. Execution of this method not only improves noise immunity of the system, but also requires fewer amounts of calculations.

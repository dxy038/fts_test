In the current EU risk assessment for pesticide registration, the European Community requires prediction of the concentration of each pesticide in air. A number of mathematical models are used to assess the fate of pesticides in groundwater, surface water and soil. PELMO 3.20 calculates the volatilization fluxes from bare soil and was improved in the new version PELMO 3.31 to include the effect of temperature and sorption in dry soil.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the new version of PELMO 3.31 in predicting the pesticide volatilization under field conditions. Procymidone, malathion, and ethoprophos were the test compounds in two different seasons (autumn and winter).
Comparing simulation results obtained with PELMO 3.31, after calibration, with the previous version PELMO 3.20 shows that the estimated volatilization results seems improved for malathion, similar or slightly overestimating in the warmer season for ethoprophos, and similar or slightly underestimating in the colder season for procymidone. The new release of PELMO allows a more accurate estimation of pesticides volatilization from soil as function of meteorological factors, especially for medium or low volatility pesticides. Some difficulties remain, such as the determination of the active air layer and the sorption increment with the soil drying.

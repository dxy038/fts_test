PEV (Plug-in Electric Vehicle) charging control is important due to the fact that the unregulated charging can have a great impact on current power grid system. This paper concerns the PEV charging control for a case study of a shopping center parking lot. A queuing model is used to predict the temporal evolution of the number of PEVs in the parking lot. The charging control considers the loss of life of a dedicated distribution transformer for the facility. The objective of the control algorithm is to balance the minimization of the transformer loss of life and the maximization of charging service quality. The queuing theory is also used to estimate the waiting time under different number of chargers. The simulation results of the proposed smart charging strategy show the effectiveness of the methodology.

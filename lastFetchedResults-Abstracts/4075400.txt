We discuss Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements available for civil use and algorithms for processing them to obtain real-time estimates of position and velocity. The main objective is to characterize the measurements and to demonstrate the levels of performance achievable with a single GPS receiver and with system augmentations which make corrections to the measurements available to the user in real time. Representative results with positioning accuracy levels ranging from tens of meters to centimeters are given based on actual measurements

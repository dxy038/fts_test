Display speed control in cartographic animation serves the crucial purpose of displaying the rate of change at appropriate display speed. The display speed in cartographic animation was typically implemented in a non-interactive form as individual speed that pre-determined. An interactive control of display speed provide with the maximum controllability during the course of animation. A better control should be designed considering visual perception, experience of flow, objective of animation and the data pattern. Novel interactive controls of display speed developed with Flash AS3.0 were evaluated through user test for functionality and effectiveness. The different forms of controls for highly-interactive cartographic animations such as push-button control and wheel control had their own advantages according to personal habits, but the latter processed more controllability.

This paper is completely tutorial in character and its sole objective is to provide the network-oriented reader with a clear and detailed presentation of the theoretical ideas underlying the insertion-loss approach to the approximation-synthesis problem of doubly resistor terminated filters. The treatment, which is leisurely and thorough, interleaves several key theorems in a systematic manner.

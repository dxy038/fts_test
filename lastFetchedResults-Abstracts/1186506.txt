This paper presents progress in the field of adaptive civil-engineering structures. Self-diagnosis, multi-objective shape control and reinforcement-learning processes are implemented within a control framework on an active tensegrity structure. Self-diagnosis extends active structural control to situations of partially defined loads. Multi-objective search is useful for computing commands that control shape while minimizing active strut stroke and stress, and maximizing stiffness. Reinforcement learning improves the control by memorizing, retrieving and adapting previous control events. The control framework is validated experimentally on an active tensegrity structure. This provides an example of an adaptive civil-engineering structure.

Within this paper we explore the response of multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) for designing ultra wide band planar antennas. In particular, we have focused on those UWB antennas heuristically designed for taking into account the inclusion of a notch for the 5 GHz to 6 GHz band. Applying these optimization schemes over a conformal FDTD code, a set of UWB circular monopole antennas is achieved.

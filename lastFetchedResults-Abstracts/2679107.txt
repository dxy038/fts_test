 Introduction Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most fatal form
                            of tuberculosis. Despite adequate treatment, its mortality and morbidity
                            is high. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings help in diagnosis
                            of TBM, although analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CFS) might sometimes
                            delay and mislead the rapid diagnosis. Case Presentation We present a
                            14- year- old Afghan immigrant male, with uncommon laboratory results of
                            advanced TBM, who referred to Baharloo hospial in Tehran, Iran, in
                            September 2016. He experienced headache and anxiety one month prior to
                            referring to the hospital; he had fever, severe headache, vomiting and
                            showed bizarre behavior 7 days before admission. Suspecting
                            meningoencephalitis, the physician advised empirical treatment. The
                            first CSF revealed polymorphonuclear (PMN) predominance with low
                            glucose, which was repeated in the second and third CSF analysis. This
                            pattern indicates early phase of TB meningitis. In day 4,
                            antituberculous treatment with corticosteroid was administered
                            empirically. Unfortunately, he succumbed to disease in day 36.
                            Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in
                            CSF was positive. The patientâ€™s presentation (lethargic to coma) and
                            brain computed tomography (CT) scan indicated advanced stage of disease.
                            Conclusions All physicians should consider TB meningitis in any patient
                            with low glucose even with serial PMN predominance in CSF.

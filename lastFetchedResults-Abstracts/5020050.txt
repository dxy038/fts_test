The main objective of the EU-promoted project MOVE (Mobile Middleware with Voice-Enabled Services, http://move.rwth-aachen.de) was the integration of voice (real-time data) and multimedia services (non-real-time data) for mobile GSM- and UMTS-based communication, transmitted via the Internet Protocol. An architecture was developed which was enhanced with an API for service providers. It permits the initiation, maintenance and termination of voice-enabled multimedia connections from an Internet site via a single link, such as collaborative Web surfing in a phone conference. Real-time voice or video streams are decoded according to the transmission quality for real-time streams. They are transmitted with high priority, relative to non-real-time data which are downsized, if necessary. Special attention is paid to the monitoring and adaptation of heterogeneous media streams concerning their adjustment to a wide range of quality-of-service parameters.

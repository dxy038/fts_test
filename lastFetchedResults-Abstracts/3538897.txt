The basic structural units of the genome are nucleotides. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a mutation at a single nucleotide position. This paper discusses several major problems in SNP data analysis and review some existing solutions in this work. Generally speaking, a rich set of SNP analysis problems are cast in the signal processing framework. Our objective is to offer a state-of-the art review on this topic from a signal processing viewpoint so that researchers in the signal processing field can grasp the important domain knowledge to overcome the barrier between the two fields

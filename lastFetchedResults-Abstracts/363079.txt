Study objective
Most US hospitals use visual inspection for the detection of cerebrospinal fluid xanthrochromia. We compared visual inspection with spectrophotometric xanthrochromia and studied the effect of tube diameter on the sensitivity of visual inspection.
Methods
Blinded, experienced laboratory technicians visually examined unmarked samples to determine the presence or absence of xanthrochromia. Samples were prepared by lysing RBCs in distilled water. Serial dilutions were placed in clear polystyrene tubes obtained from standard lumbar puncture trays. Laboratory technicians were asked to examine each sample for xanthrochromia using visual inspection. Next, they were asked to interpret the same set of samples with the assistance of a threshold standard. Last, they were asked to interpret the same dilutions, but this time presented in a larger-diameter tube. The absorbance of each sample was measured in a double-beam spectrophotometer at wavelengths between 300 and 700 nm. Samples were said to demonstrate spectrophotometric xanthrochromia if they had an absorbance greater than 0.023 at 415 nm.
Results
Sixteen laboratory technicians were shown a total of 160 samples, of which 64 (40%) demonstrated spectrophotometric xanthrochromia. Visual inspection of the samples was 26.6% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI] 16% to 38%) and 97.9% specific (95% CI 95% to 100%) for spectrophotometric xanthrochromia. Using a reference standard did not improve the performance of visual inspection, but increasing collection-tube diameter increased the sensitivity to 55% (95% CI 43% to 68%).
Conclusion
Visual inspection is not sensitive for the detection of spectrophotometric xanthrochromia. Increasing the diameter of the collection tubes did improve sensitivity. Emergency physicians should be aware of how xanthrochromia is determined at their institutions and understand the implications of using visual detection to determine the presence or absence of xanthrochromia.

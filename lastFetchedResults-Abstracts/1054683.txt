Alumina ceramic-on-crosslinked polyethylene (C-CLPE), metal-on-metal (M/M) and alumina-on-alumina ceramic (C/C) articulations are high performance, low wear options for hip replacement bearings. Our objective was to compare the hip joint simulator wear performance of these alternative bearing couples to each other and to a control bearing of standard ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE).

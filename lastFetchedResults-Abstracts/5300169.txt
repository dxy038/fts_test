This paper presents a collection of experience related to success factors in graduate and postgraduate education. The experiences are mainly concerned with how to make the education relevant from an industrial viewpoint. This is emphasized as a key issue in software engineering education and research, since the main objective is to give the students a good basis for large-scale software development in an industrial environment. The presentation is divided into experiences at the graduate and postgraduate levels respectively. For each level a number of strategies to achieve industrial relevance are presented. These strategies have been successful, but it is concluded that more can be done regarding industrial collaboration in the planning and conduction of experiments and case studies. Another interesting strategy for the future is a special postgraduate programme for people employed in industry

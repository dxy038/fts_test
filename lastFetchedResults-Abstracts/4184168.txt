This paper presents implementation of single-phase matrix converter as a DC-AC converter with bidirectional capabilities. Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation was used to synthesize the output waveform. The proposed converter proves to be a versatile topology extending the capabilities beyond the direct AC-AC converter and four quadrant DC chopper into inverter operation. Selected experimental results are presented to verify the proposed operation.

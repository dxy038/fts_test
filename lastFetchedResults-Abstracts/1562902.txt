In this paper, a Novel Parallel Quantum Genetic Algorithm (NPQGA) is proposed for the stochastic Job Shop Scheduling Problem with the objective of minimizing the expected value of makespan, where the processing times are subjected to independent normal distributions. Based on the parallel evolutionary idea and some concepts of quantum theory, we simulate a model of parallel quantum computation. In this frame, there are some demes (sub-populations) and some universes (groups of populations), which are structured in super star-shaped topologies. A new migration scheme based on penetration theory is developed to control migration rate and direction adaptively between demes, and a novel quantum crossover strategy is devised among universes. The quantum evolution is executed in every deme by applying some improvement operators (the coding mechanism aiming at job shop, the new quantum rotation angle and the catastrophe operator). Experiment results show NPQGA's effectiveness and applicability.

Burr in drilling plays an important role on product quality and hence it is essential to minimize the burr size at the production stage. This paper presents the application of Taguchi optimization method for simultaneous minimization of burr height and burr thickness influenced by cutting conditions and drill geometry. The approach of Taguchi design for drilling optimization problem is based on multi-performance objective, which employs the membership functions. In the present work, optimal values of cutting speed, feed, point angle and lip clearance angle are determined for selected drill diameter values to minimize burr height and burr thickness during drilling of AISI 316L stainless steel workpieces. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation results and experimental verifications.

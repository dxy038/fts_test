Background and Objective: The unpredictable nature and course of epilepsy may have a significant impact on both the physical and psychological functioning of the child and the family. On the other hand, parental knowledge and believes concerning epilepsy has significant impact on adjustment and quality of life for both the child and family. Therefore, this study was set out to investigate the level of knowledge about epilepsy and its relationship with general health in parents of epileptic children.

Subjects and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 35 parents (27 mothers, 8 fathers) of children who had been diagnosed for epilepsy by convenience sampling at Golestan hospital in Ahvaz. Parental knowledge was measured using the self-made epilepsy knowledge questionnaire, while general health was measured using the GHQ-28.

Results:Twenty three parents (65.7%) of parents were considered to have psychological problems. In 91.4% of parents, the level of knowledge about epilepsy was low to moderate. Significant correlation were found between level of parental knowledge and general health (PcO.OOl).

Conclusion: The present study showed that parental knowledge about epilepsy was generally low and it was correlated with decreased general health. Therefore, the present findings suggest the importance of psycho-social support and assessment of parents with epileptic children. Also, providing more information and education about epilepsy may decrease these psychological problems.

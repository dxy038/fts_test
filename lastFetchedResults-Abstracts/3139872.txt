It is important and significant to select a high efficiency path planning method for the operational employ of UAV. According to the characteristic of current path planning methods and the path planning of unmanned aerial vehicle, the paper established an index system which was used to evaluate path planning methods. Based on this, it had an evaluation of path planning method by using grey clustering evaluation method with improved index weigh coefficient, and then explained the application method by combing with a example. From the result of example, it can be seen that using path planning methodÂ´s grey clustering evaluation with improved index weigh coefficient can effectively reduce the influence of subjective factor and get a more objective result, furthermore it also provides a effective way to comprehensively and systematically evaluate path planning methods. It can provide decision-making basis for selecting and optimizing path planning method too.

In this paper, we propose and investigate a multiple antenna, space-code division multiple access (SCDMA) system operating on mobile Rayleigh fading channels, with the emphasis on measured channel data. The main objective is to improve the capacity performance of existing direct-spread code-division multiple access (DS- CDMA) systems by employing multiple transmit and/or multiple receive antennas. In the proposed system, partial decision variables (PDVs) in conjunction with multiple antennas are used to exploit the code and spatial diversity available in a SCDMA system. By detecting the received signal over different portions of the signaling interval, PDVs can be weighted using adaptive filtering techniques, improving signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). Results through simulations show that PDV SCDMA assisted by adaptive filtering is capable of performing space-time code detection while suppressing multi-user interference (MAI)

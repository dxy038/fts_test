We present the design and implementation of intrusion detection and alerting mechanism (eleAlert) for fences separating wildlife habitats and human settlements. Our objective is to improve the effectiveness of electric fences as a solution to the prevailing human-elephant conflict (HEC) in many parts of the world. eleAlert uses a network of sensors to detect and locate damages instantly and alert communities under threat via the mobile communications network.

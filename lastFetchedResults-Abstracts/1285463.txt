Although a lot of research has been done on the relationship between ethics and religion and also their interaction with various sciences, a clear picture of the relationship of ethics and politics in the light of Sharia, for solving the existing doubts, is not presented. In this regard, Mulla Sadra Shirazi established a new philosophical system (transcendent wisdom) to show the relation of ethics and politics, which was comprehensive of intellect and revelation. However, the question to be answered is how he could achieve this (Question). In transcendent wisdom, since ethics makes use of two sources of intellect and revelation, it possesses the required capability to have relationship with politics (Hypothesis).
Investigating the relationship between wisdom and Sharia in transcendent wisdom and then analyzing the relationship between ethics and politics is a way of assessing the hypothesis of the present article (Method). In this comparison we have sought to show that the ethics which is originated from wisdom and Sharia, with a comprehensive look at the dimensions of man and community, can promise the Utopia (Objective). The need for simultaneous attention to wisdom, Sharia, ethics, man and community, as the tools of achieving the Utopia, is from among the results of the present article (Findings).

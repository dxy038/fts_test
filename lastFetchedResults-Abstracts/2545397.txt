Judicial justice also requires to be fair and objective. Objectiveness of judicial proceedings requires that all facts be considered under previously established rules and procedures in order to make justice to be done.

So there is no way except due processes to ensure justice and fairness in judicial proceedings. And this is the main important means to secure basic rights and freedoms of human beings. The present work considers the significance of a fair trial, the importance of due process and procedural justice from the view point of the Islamic judicial doctrine.  It attempts to illustrate fair trial and its procedural requirements have been strongly recommended by Islamic judicial doctrine.  [1] Corresponding Author’s Email: mfazaeli2007@gmail.com

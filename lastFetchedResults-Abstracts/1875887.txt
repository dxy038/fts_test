OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine the relationships among the intensity of intubated patients' negative emotional responses to being unable to speak and selected personal and situational variables.

: Prospective correlational.

G: Four intensive care units in a midwestern, university-affiliated medical center.

TS: A convenience sample of 48 patients intubated for 24 or more hours, alert and oriented to person, place, and situation.

E MEASURES: Emotional responses (anger and worry/fear) to being unable to speak.

S: Multiple regression showed that self-esteem, severity of illness, difficulty with communication, and the number of days intubated at data collection were significantly associated with patients' emotional responses.

SIONS: Results from this study extend prior research and support the need for nurses to facilitate communication and to support self-esteem in patients receiving ventilatory assistance, particularly in the early days of intubation. Implications for future research are discussed.

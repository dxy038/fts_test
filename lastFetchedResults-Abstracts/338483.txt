Objective
To elucidate the mechanism of immunologic escape of leukemia cells and establish an effective anti-leukemia immunotherapy, we attempted to generate dendritic cells from leukemia cells in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Using these leukemia-derived dendritic cells, we investigated leukemia cell-associated T-cell anergy.
Materials and Methods

Leukemia cells of 30 patients with AML were cultured with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-4, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Cultured leukemia cells were evaluated for antigen-presenting ability by mixed leukocyte culture (MLC). Normal lymphocytes, which were cocultured with leukemia blasts in the first MLC, were cultured with leukemia-derived dendritic cells in the second MLC.
Results

In cultures of leukemia cells from 21 of 30 patients examined, cells with stellate morphology and cell fractions with CD1a+ and/or CD83+ were present. Autologous MLC using lymphocytes obtained in remission phase as responders as well as allogeneic MLC demonstrated antigen-presenting ability in leukemia-derived dendritic cells. Leukemia cells of FAB-M0, M1, M2, M3, or M6 morphology/phenotype gave rise to dendritic cells as well as leukemia cells of M5. The leukemic origin of dendritic cells was suggested by in situ hybridization. By coculture with CD80− leukemia blasts, the response of normal lymphocytes to leukemia-derived dendritic cells cultured from the same individual as that of leukemia blasts was markedly reduced, compared with the lymphocytes cultured with leukemia blasts from a different individual as leukemia blasts.
Conclusions

Escape of leukemia cells from anti-leukemia immunity may be associated with T-cell anergy caused by leukemia blasts. The results of the present study suggest that leukemia-derived dendritic cells can be applied efficiently in anti-leukemia immunotherapy.

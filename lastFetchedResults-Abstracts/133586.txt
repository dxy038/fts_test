Introduction: Zinc has important effects on structural and functional activities of many proteins and enzymes, especially in regulation of immune system.
Objective: This study was carried out to examine the in vitro effects of different concentrations of Zinc on viability and morphology of T-Lymphoid (Molt-4) and B-Lymphoid (Raji) cell line.
Materials and Methods: In this study, the cell line was exposed to different concentrations of Zinc (100µM to
500µM) followed by incubation (37°C55%Co2) at various time points (12 to 72 hrs). The cells were then
evaluated with trypan blue exclusion dye, and Wright-Gimsa staining.
Results: The results of this study showed almost different responses to different amounts of Zinc by the T and B cell line. Concentrations less than 100µM of Zinc at different incubation time points had little to no effects on cell line when compared to the controls. Higher concentrations of Zinc (>100µM) diminished cell viability to 70% at 12 hrs and less than 50% at 24 to 72 hrs of incubation times.
Conclusion: We concluded that Zinc shows cytotoxic effects (Raji & Molt-4) depending on the concentrations used. At higher concentrations, it exerts cytotoxic effects.

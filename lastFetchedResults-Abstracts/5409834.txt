Radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems which act as backbone networks are very promising means of reducing overall costs of 60 GHz WPANs, as well leading to networks with limited intercellular interference. The main objective of this paper is to compare the performance of two different Optical Single Sideband strategies in a 60 GHz OFDM-RoF system, in terms of inter-subcarrier distortion and robustness against dispersion. The comparative study presented here also includes practical impairments such as a finite extinction ratio in Mach-Zehnder modulators and system-added noise.

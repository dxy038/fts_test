Real-time two-stage blind source separation (BSS) method for convolutive mixtures of speech is now being studied by the authors, in which a single-input multiple-output (SIMO)-model-based independent component analysis (ICA) and a SIMO-model-based binary masking are combined. In addition, we have developed a pocket-size real-time DSP module implementing the two-stage BSS method. In this paper, we introduce a high-presence hearing-aid system which can reduce the interference sound and reproduce the target sound while keeping the directivity, and realize the system with the real-time BSS module. To evaluate it, we carried out the objective and subjective experiments using 9 users. From these results, it is revealed that the decomposition performance and the directivity maintenance of the proposed system are superior to those of conventional methods.

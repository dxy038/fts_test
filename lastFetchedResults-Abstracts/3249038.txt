The objective of this work was to evaluate the possibility of adding Selenium to a Bioactive glass. The subsequent glass along with a Selenium free bioactive glass underwent standard characterization techniques. The results showed that the Selenium containing glass had similar characteristics as the selenium free glass and thus will be considered for future testing including in vitro and in vivo testing.

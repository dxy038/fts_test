Digital video has pervaded the lives of people due to the popularity of applications. In this paper, we propose novel objective quality metrics for video sequences. This metrics are capable of capturing spatial distortions in video sequences, in addition to temporal artifacts. And they can quantify the spatial distortions and differentiate the type of distortion. Furthermore the metrics correlate well with the subjective quality measures because perception distortions of human have been taken into consideration. Experimental results show that our perceptual quality metrics performs better than the existing methods.

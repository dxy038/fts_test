The Nuclear Organization and Management Analysis Concept was presented at the IEEE Human Factors meeting in 1988. The concept and its associated methodology have been demonstrated at two commercial nuclear power plants (NPPs) and one fossil power plant. The insights and results obtained from the two demonstration studies at the commercial NPPs are discussed. The results emphasize the utility of the methodology in providing a more systematic and objective description of organizational factors influencing performance in NPPs and demonstrate the methodologyÂ´s ability to differentiate between plants.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

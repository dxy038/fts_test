Network coding has been considered as an effective strategy for improving the performance of wireless mesh networks (WMNs) by encoding multiple packets into a single transmission. Existing work shows that integration of network coding and routing at the network layer can achieve good performance in terms of network throughput and packet delay. In this paper, we propose a rate-adaptive coding-aware multiple path routing mechanism for WMNs. The main design objective is to improve the network performance via traffic splitting for maximizing the coding opportunities in the network. Simulation results are used to verify the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.

Background and Objective: Fascioliasis is an important zoonotic disease that causes several health problems
and economical losses in different parts of Iran including Zanjan. Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica are
recognized as causative agents of the disease. The differential diagnosis between these two species is very
important for planning and control of infection. This study was designed to identify the Fasciola species by
molecular methods in Zanjan (Iran).
Methods and Materials: A number of 535 adult Fasciola worms were collected from the natural infected
livers of cattles and sheep in local slaughterhouse. Living flukes were washed extensively in PBS at 37 °c
and then anterior half of adult worms were stored at -20 °c in 70% ethanol. Total genomic DNA was
extracted from individual flukes by modified phenol-chloroform method. Nucleotide polymorphism of ITS2
fragment ofrDNA was investigated using PCR-RFLP assay and sequencing technique.
Results: The results of PCR-RFLP and comparison of ITS2 sequences with the BLAST GenBank database
clarified that all specimens were F. hepatica. The obtained sequences are available in the GenBank., with
accession numbers EU391412 to EU39l424.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed no evidence of F. gigantica infection in sheep and cattles in
Zanjan as all ofthe isolates were found to be F. hepatica.

Objective: To examine the effect of accessibility, income and out- of- pocket payments for visit and medicine on the utilization of specialist doctors' services (visits), in the population covered by Social Security Organization (SSO).
Materials and Methods: Managerial data bases throughout the SSO were used to measure the effect of assumed variables on the utilization of specialist doctors' services (visits) in a thirty-million population covered by SSO. The data were collected from 1998 to 2009 and then adjusted for the purpose of the study. A bilogarithmic regression model with panel data, using fixed effect model was estimated.
Results: The study results showed that 1% increase in the geographic accessibility and medicine costs would increase the utilization of specialist doctors' services by 23% and 17%,  respectively.  As well, out-of-pocket payments for specialists' visits and the insureds' incomes  have no  significant effect on the utilization of these services. 
Conclusion: Visiting specialists in private sector showed no responsiveness to out-of- pocket payments, but more for geographic accessibility. Social Security Organization can regulate and control the utilization of these services through considering the flexibility of different provinces to different factors.

A wind tunnel study was performed to examine some turbulent characteristics and statistical properties of the concentration field developing from the steady release of a tracer gas at street level in a canyon amidst urban roughness. The experiment was conducted with the approaching wind direction perpendicular to the street axis and, with a street width to building height aspect ratio equal to one. Concentration time series were recorded at 70 points within the test street cross-section and above. Mean concentrations, variances and related turbulent quantities, as well as other statistical quantities including quantiles were computed. Concentration spectra and autocorrelation functions were also examined. The emphasis is put here on the results concerning mean concentrations and the variance of concentration fluctuations. The main objective of this paper is to put forward potential benefits of the experimental approach taken in this study. Through a simple and already widely studied configuration it is aimed to show how, for modelling purposes, this approach can help improving our understanding of the mechanisms of dipersion of pollution from car exhausts in built-up areas and, with further measurements, how it could assist in drawing specifications for siting monitoring networks.

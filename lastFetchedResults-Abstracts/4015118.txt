We have experimentally demonstrated a 60-GHz bidirectional radio-over-fiber system with single-sideband (SSB) modulation of orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) signals for the downlink and wavelength reuse for the uplink. A two-carrier-injected distributed-feedback laser is used to realize the OFDM signalsÂ´ SSB modulation in the central office for the downlink. In the uplink, the weakly modulated one of the two downlink carriers is filtered out for wavelength reuse. Transmission of 4.3-Gb/s 16-quadrature-amplitude-modulation (QAM) or 3.2-Gb/s 64-QAM OFDM signals on the 60-GHz carrier for the downlink and the 2.5-Gb/s nonreturn-to-zero signal for the uplink are both successfully demonstrated over 56-km standard single-mode fiber without chromatic dispersion compensation.

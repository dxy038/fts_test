This article revisits the neuropathological history of attention deficit and related behavioral problems in children, and focuses on the important contribution of EEG findings to both the classification and treatment of these disorders. Recent topographic quantitative EEG methods have disclosed several distinct patterns of abnormality in children diagnosed as ADD, and have provided improved guidelines for pharmacological treatment. Additionally, advances in EEG technology have given rise to a promising new alternative behavioral treatment for ADD called neurofeedback. Quantitative EEG assessment is considered essential in relation to this treatment approach as well. Objective findings and theoretical models relevant to both modalities of treatment are reviewed.

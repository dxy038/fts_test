Introduction& Objective: Zander, Sander lucioperca, is an important and economical fish of the Caspian Sea. Due to the decline of stock in recent years, fry with different weights are released into the rivers, ending to Caspian Sea, by Iran Fishery Organization. Study is essential on osmo-regulatory function and the formation of the structures involved, including the development of gills and skin ionocytes for optimizing releasing process into freshwater or saltwater environments.
Material and Methods: Development and osmo-regulatory Function of gill, distribution and density of skin ionocytes  of Caspian Sea Zanders, Sanders were examined by histology with E & H staining and immune-localization of Na+, K+-ATPase, (larvae from day 1 to day 11 after hatching. 
Results: Development of filaments was started from 4th days but immunofluorescence  ionocytes were not observed in them. It was found weak immunofluorescence in filaments on the 8th days. The first buds of lamella were appeared with very poor immunofluorescence on the 11th days. Predominant distribution of the skin ionocytes was limited to the yolk sac membrane to 8 days after hatching and then tended to ventral region of posterior end of body. Number and surface occupied by ionocytes in Skin were increased from the first day to 11 days after hatching.
Conclusion: In Caspian Sea zander larvae, development of osmoregulatory function of the gill will not be completed up to the 11th days and the skin ionocytes will be responsible for osmoregulation until this stage.

Respiratory sound is associated with many lung diseases. By observing respiratory sound symptoms, we can know more about lung conditions. In this research, we construct an efficient lung sound recording system according to CORSA, and develop a spectrogram process flow technique to object wheeze. It is a low cost and efficient system. In clinic test, we also can precisely objective wheeze up to about 89%

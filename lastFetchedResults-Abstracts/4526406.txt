The objective of this work is to demonstrate the operation of a system that allows monitoring, controlling and configuring a wireless household-electric network using a personal digital assistant (PDA) as the user interface. Initially, the wireless communication was established by Bluetooth. In the next step, the hardware and firmware of the appliance will be modified in order to implement a ZigBee protocol. LabVIEW has been used to develop the user interface in the PDA.

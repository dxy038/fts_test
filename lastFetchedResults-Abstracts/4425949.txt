Subjective studies have been conducted in the past to obtain human judgments of visual quality on distorted images in order, among other things, to benchmark objective image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms. Existing subjective studies primarily have records of human ratings on images that were corrupted by only one of many possible distortions. However, the majority of images that are available for consumption are corrupted by multiple distortions. Towards broadening the corpora of records of human responses to visual distortions, we recently conducted a study on two types of multiply distorted images to obtain human judgments of the visual quality of such images. Further, we compared the performance of several existing objective image quality measures on the new database and analyze the effects of multiple distortions on commonly used quality-determinant features and on human ratings.

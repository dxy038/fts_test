Objective: To find a new way to culture osteoblasts. Methods: Rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were cultured with mechanical stress by (XX) 10 mins a day for seven days. Giemsa staining was used to tell the shapes of the cells and alizarin red S staining was used to detect the formation of osteoblasts. Results: (1) The shapes of the cells suffered with the mechanical stress were not as the same as the MSCs. (2) A few mineralization nodes were detected after cultured with the mechanical stress. Conclusion: Culturing MSCs with mechanical stress is a new way to obtain the osteoblasts.

Novel sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone)s with electron-withdrawing sulfone groups in each repeat unit were synthesized via step polymerization followed by post-sulfonation using chlorosulfonic acid. The sulfonation degree can be readily controlled by adjusting the feed ratio of the repeat unit of polymers to chlorosulfonic acid. The synthesized polymers are soluble in common aprotic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, N,Nâ€²-dimethylacetamide and dimethylformamide, and can be cast into transparent membranes from their solutions. The ion exchange capacity, water uptake, swelling ratio, sulfonation degree, mechanical property, oxidative property, thermal property and proton conductivity were investigated in detail using different methodologies. As an objective to apply these polymers as separators for vanadium redox flow battery, the VO2+ permeability and cell performance for the single cell were examined and assessed.

The objective of this paper is to present a novel realistic simulation tool-set for evaluating video delivered quality over wireless network. This tool-set integrates EvalVid and NS-2. With the integration, researchers can easily analyze their designed mechanisms, such as network protocols or QoS control schemes in a realistic simulation environment. We used a case study about video transmission over wireless network to demonstrate the simulation with the tool-set. From the results, we found that the quality of video transmission with burst packet errors is superior to the random distributed packet errors in the same packet error rate. In addition, in the same packet error rate, unicast transmission leads to better video delivered quality than multicast transmission because of retransmission. Also, using the tool-set researchers can assess video quality not only with the evaluation metrics, but also with real video sequences. In brief, researchers who utilize our proposed QoS assessment framework will be benefited in verifying their designs regarding video transmission over wireless network

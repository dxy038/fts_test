Supplier selection is a multi-criteria decision-making problem which is the process of determining the best feasible solution according to the established criteria. A new method is proposed to solve supplierspsila selection problems with linguistic assessment information. In the method, the two-tuple linguistic representation developed in recent years is used to aggregate the linguistic assessment information. Integration of subjective AHP and objective rough entropy weight, both avoid man-made one-sided subjective, but also give enough attention on the expert advice. At last, a numerical example illustrates the application of our approach.

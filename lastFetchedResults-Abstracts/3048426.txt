We propose a traffic control approach that integrates ramp metering and dynamic route guidance using a model predictive control framework. The main objective of the control is to minimize the total time spent (TTS) in the network by providing accurate travel times shown the dynamic route guidance panels (DRIPs) as controller input to the traffic network while taking into account the effect of other traffic control measures, such as ramp metering. By aiming at minimizing the TTS as well as the difference between travel times shown on the DRIPs and the travel times actually realized by the drivers, the interests of both the individual drivers as well as the road administration are pursued. Simulation results for a case study show that the proposed integrated MPC traffic control results in a lower TTS while the drivers get accurate travel time information.

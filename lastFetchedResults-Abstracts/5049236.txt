EDEN, a computer-aided software engineering (CASE) environment, is currently being developed. The objective of this project is to integrate structure design methodologies, software module libraries, and rigorous testing through the entire software life-cycle. In addition to supporting each phase of the life-cycle, EDEN will provide project management tools such as metrics analysis, configuration management, and quality assurance compliance. An important concept inherent in this research is that an effective CASE environment cannot be achieved without completely integrating the different phases through a common database system. An interactive graphics interface to shelter the EDEN user from the complexity of the system will also be developed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Abstract
Introduction: Tuberculosis is one of the most important health problems in developing countries like Iran, where Tuberculosis drug resistance is going to be a challenge.  
Objective: We evaluated the results of TB treatment in patients with Tuberculosis, 2001-2010 in Rasht.
Materials and Methodos: In this descriptive study, data including demographic information and questionnaire of tuberculosis were completed from TB software and files in patients with relapse, failure and multi-drug resistance.    
Results: In total, 98 patients were evaluated, consisting of 88 (89.8%) male and 10 (10.2%) female. As revealed, 86 patients (78.8%) had pulmonary TB and 12 non-pulmonary TB (12.2%). There was a significant relationship between being prisoner and the result of treatment (P=0.01) and also the kind of disease (P=0.001). 
Conclusion: Complete and accurate registration of information and suitable programming considering the results of this study can be useful in decreasing the related health costs in Rasht and reducing factors associated with drug resistance. For better results, it is recommended that a general study be held in Guilan province before and after starting treatment, in order to determine the primary and secondary resistance

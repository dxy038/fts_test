Objective The purpose of this article is to describe both the strengths and weaknesses of the medical voice literature. Methods Retrospective review of the voice literature with comparisons to key articles in the general medical literature. Results There are strengths in the voice literature with increasing focus on levels of evidence. Areas of deficit are: publishing negative studies, publishing risk-benefit assessment, well-structured accurate abstracts, studies in children, voice function in laryngeal stenosis and in laryngeal cancer, clinical implications of basic science voice research, worldwide diversity, appropriate advertising, humor, and thoughtful letters to the editor. There are areas that appear to be excessive: self-citations and redundant case series. Conclusions There are great opportunities to publish in the medical voice literature. Careful consideration of the quality of the work and the value of the potential addition to the literature should be considered before publishing.

The objective of this research work is to provide a systematic method to perform molecular dynamics simulation or evaluation for meshing friction properties approach of micro/nano-gear train in MEMS. A model for meshing friction of micro/nano-gear train is proposed by using molecular dynamics based on investigation about a pair of meshing nano-teeth. The results show that the frictional characteristics in single meshing region are similar to the situation in the normal macro-gears meshing; however, the zero fictional force is not shown on the node of meshing. The maximum of the frictional force becomes larger and larger and the minimum of the frictional force becomes smaller and smaller when the number of the atomic layer in z direction increases. So the curve of the frictional force becomes steeper than the situation in normal macro-gears meshing. The maximum and the minimum of the frictional force are all invariable but the curve of the frictional force becomes steeper when the angular velocity of the powered gear increases. In the other case, there are no any changes in curve of the frictional force when the resisting torque increases.

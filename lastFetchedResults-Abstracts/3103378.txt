Finding an advanced manufacturing mode adapted to Chinese environment is an important issue to academic community in China. Success in world market of Haier makes it hot researching issue since T mode was applied. What is T mode and whether T mode is an advanced manufacturing mode are objective of this paper. Based on analyzing theory of Advanced Manufacturing Modes (AMM) and the operational mechanism of Haier&#8217;s T mode in China, the paper demonstrates that T mode is a new AMM in strategy, technology, organization, and staff. Moreover, by comparing with other AMM, such as JIT, LP, AG, it is shown that T mode not only absorbs the main philosophy of these AMMs, but also develops a new manufacturing mode. Finally, the performances of T mode in Haier show that T mode can increase the consumer response and improve the competition ability for manufacturers in world competence.

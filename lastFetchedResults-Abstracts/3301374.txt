Objective: To discuss the correlation on TCM syndromes of congestive heart failure, cardiac function and brain natriuretic peptide. Methods: 423 congestive heart failure cases from several hospitals (from December, 2010 to September, 2012) have been collected, with statistical analyzing by SPSS18.0. The correlations on CHF syndromes, cardiac functional grading and brain natriuretic peptide have got studied. Results: With the going up of brain natriuretic peptide, syndromes are in order of heart blood stasis, qi-yin deficiency, phlegm blocking heart vessels, yang-deficiency-water-flooding, phlegm-stagnation, qi-deficiency-blood-stasis, Qi-stagnation-blood-stasis, etc. Syndromes of phlegm blocking heart vessels, heart blood stasis, qi-yin deficiency are mostly manifested in patients of cardiac function level 1 or 2. Syndromes of qi-deficiency-blood-stasis, heart-qi-deficiency, and phlegm-stagnation are often in cardiac function level 3. And y ang-deficiency-water-flooding syndrome is closely related to the ones of cardiac function level 4. The level of brain natriuretic peptide goes up with the increase of cardiac function grading. Conclusion: The levels of cardiac function and brain natriuretic peptide increase in patients with congestive heart failure. TCM syndromes aggravate with the going up of both of them. The two indexes are expected to provide reference for the diagnostic criteria establishment of common syndromes of congestive heart failure.

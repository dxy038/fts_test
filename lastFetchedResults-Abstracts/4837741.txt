The research status of the construction contractor incentive mechanism design have been reviewed and commented from several aspects such as progress incentive, cost incentive, quality and safety incentive, coordinate multi-objective incentive, as well as the implicit incentive. Some disadvantages in the current study, such as the incentive method mainly focusing on network optimization, incentive contract type mainly focusing on cost plus incentive fee or fixed price incentive contract, little attention to the incentive to more than one contractor which work for the same owner and insufficient implicit incentives and so on, are pointed out. Further, the future research and development trend of construction project field is prospected. The systematic research of the construction contractor incentive mechanism design which can be based on the incentive theory and principal-agent theory is put forward.

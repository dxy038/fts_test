The objective of this study was to detect the selenium level in the environment and the population of Zhoukoudian area,
Beijing, and to discuss the influence of various factors on serum selenium level. The soil, drinking water, and foodstuff samples
and venous blood samples of 401 individuals were obtained to determine the selenium level by gas chromatograph equipped with a
63Ni electron capture detector (ECD). The selenium level was 0.210±0.013 μg/g in soil, 0.017 μg/L±0.002 in drinking water,
0.034±0.002 μg/g in rice, and 0.034±0.012 μg/g in wheat flour. This index showed that the Zhoukoudian area of Beijing was a
moderate or marginal level selenium ecological landscape. The mean serum selenium level of the population was 75.01±28.35 μg/
L, ranging between 35.2 and 160.4 μg/L. A total of 279 (69.6%) individuals exhibited serum selenium level below 80 μg/L, which
is the lowest threshold for the activity of glutathione peroxidases (GPx) in vivo. A total of 35 (8.5%) individuals exhibited serum
selenium level below 45 μg/L. It is widely recommended that below this value (45 μg/L) there is an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease and cancer. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that serum selenium level was positively associated with body mass
index (β=0.137; P=0.011), serum total cholesterol TC (β=0.785; P=0.000), however, negatively associated with systolic blood
pressure (β=−0.172; P=0.023), serum triglyceride (β=−0.170; P=0.007), high density lipoprotein–cholesterol (β=−0.121;
P=0.027), and low high density lipoprotein–cholesterol (β=−0.568; P=0.027).

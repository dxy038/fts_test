Numerous scoring systems have been proposed, and there is an inaccuracy in the anatomical and physiological differences between patients. Injury severity scoring (ISS) is a process by which the complexity of traumatic patients will be reduced to a single number. The objective of this study was to determine whether ISS scoring along with the sub-categories of the mechanism of injury, age and place where hospital traumatic deaths occurred are able to predict the clinical outcome. The database registered accidents (DRAs) were gathered from Trauma Centre of Kamyab Hospital, Mashhad, East of Iran from March 2011 to April 2012. ISS was used to define the major trauma. 15496 traumatic patients referred to the hospital and traumatic deaths occurred in 289 patients. Blunt trauma accounted for 286 (99%) of death and penetrating trauma for only 1%. Our findings concerning the injury pattern, correlation between ISS and time of death suggest that patients who die in the first hour after admission have the highest ISS (average of 70.2); whereas those who die after 72 hours have the lowest ISS. With regards to the predictive strength of the combination of GCS and ISS, a predictive system for analyzing the clinical outcome may be provided.

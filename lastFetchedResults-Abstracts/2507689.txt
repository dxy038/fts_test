Objective: Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) appears to be
an osteoclast-activating factor, bearing an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple
myeloma. Some studies demonstrated that U-266 myeloma cell line and primary myeloma
cells expressed RANK and RANKL. It had been reported that the expression of myeloid
and monocytoid markers was increased by co-culturing myeloma cells with hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs). This study also attempted to show the molecular mechanism of RANK
and RANKL on differentiation capability of human cord blood HSC to osteoclast, as well
as expression of calcitonin receptor (CTR) on cord blood HSC surface.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, CD133+ hematopoietic stem cells were
isolated from umbilical cord blood and cultured in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (M-CSF) and RANKL. Osteoclast differentiation was characterized by using
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, giemsa staining, immunophenotyping,
and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for specific genes.
Results: Hematopoietic stem cells expressed RANK before and after differentiation into
osteoclast. Compared to control group, flow cytometric results showed an increased
expression of RANK after differentiation. Expression of CTR mRNA showed TRAP reaction
was positive in some differentiated cells, including osteoclast cells.
Conclusion: Presence of RANKL and M-CSF in bone marrow could induce HSCs
differentiation into osteoclast.

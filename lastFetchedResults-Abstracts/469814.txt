Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess maternal and fetal morbidity and death in cases of severe preterm preeclampsia that were managed expectantly.
Study design
It is a retrospective study that included 155 singleton pregnancies with severe preeclampsia at <34 weeks of gestation that were managed expectantly over a 10-year period. Perinatal outcomes of both mother and fetus were stratified according to gestational age and the severity of fetal growth restriction ≤3th percentile, 4th to 5th percentile, >5th to10th percentile, and >10th percentile.
Results
The mean gestational age at admission was 30.2 ± 2.4 weeks (range, 23.9-34.0 weeks). The mean latency period was 5.3 ± 5.2 days, with a perinatal mortality rate of 3.9%. Gestational age of <30 weeks of gestation was the strongest variable that affected perinatal outcome, whereas fetal growth restriction played a marginal role.
Conclusion
Expectant management is recommended strongly in fetuses at <30 weeks of gestation, irrespective of fetal growth restriction. Delivery should be considered at >30 weeks of gestation.

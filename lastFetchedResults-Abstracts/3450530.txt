We consider a parameterized family <img alt="{S_{\\alpha }, \\alpha in a}, a \\subset R^{\\infty }" src="/images/tex/3836.gif"/> , of systems or sources having stochastic outputs <img alt="{x_{n}}" src="/images/tex/3837.gif"/> that are partially described by a statistic (e.g, correlation function) <img alt="\\sigma _{\\alpha }(\\tau )" src="/images/tex/3838.gif"/> . If we represent <img alt="\\alpha =(\\alpha _{1},\\alpha _{2}...,\\alpha _{n}...)" src="/images/tex/3839.gif"/> , then by the system order M_{alpha} we mean the index <img alt="n" src="/images/tex/23.gif"/> of the last no nonzero term in the expansinn of &#945;. Our objective is to generate a sequence <img alt="{\\hat{M}_{n}(x_{1},... ,X_{n})}" src="/images/tex/3840.gif"/> of estimates of the <img alt="M_{\\alpha }^{0}" src="/images/tex/3841.gif"/> that converge to it at least in probability. We provide conditions ensuring the existence of such a statistically consistent sequence of estimators, as wen as improved conditions yielding convergence in mean-square and with probability one. We establish existence by providing a method for constructing a family of consistent estimators of system order. We then apply our method to estimate the order of a scalar moving averages process and the order of a scalar autoregressive process. Our present results are primarily Of a theoretical nature, as we lack the efficiency and simulation studies desirable in support of a practical estimator of system order.

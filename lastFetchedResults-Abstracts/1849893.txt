Anaemia in cancer patients is multifactorial and may occur as a either a direct effect of the cancer, as a result of the cancer treatment itself, or due to chemical factors produced by the cancer. The clinical symptoms of anaemia vary according to the individualâ€™s capacity to respond to blood loss or reduced red cell production.

ematological features in anaemic patients depend on the different types of malignant disease. Clinical and laboratory evaluation, and examination of the bone marrow can provide important diagnostic clues in many cases. Decisions are commonly made based on subjective consideration rather than on objective data. Blood transfusion involves many hazards, some of which may be reduced or avoided. Erythropoietin (EPO) treatment has been found to be effective in preventing anaemia and in reducing the need for blood transfusions, although it would be useful to identify high-risk patient subgroups who would benefit most from this expensive treatment. In advanced cancer patients the use of blood transfusion should be evaluated on an individual basis, according to the presence of distressing symptoms and life expectancy. These measures are unlikely to have an effect in irreversible and progressive bleeding states.

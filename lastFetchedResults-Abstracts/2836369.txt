The present paper deals with the power quality analysis in a wastewater treatment plant. The measuring campaign was conducted for 1 week and has the objective to investigate the energy efficiency and power quality impact of the plant functioning. The wastewater treatment plant is located in the east side of Romania, in the second largest city of Romania and on the Black Sea seaside. The analysis revealed that harmonic perturbations are occurring, mainly due to the pumping stations of the plant. In addition, a low power factor was observed and measures for its improvement were proposed and are under implementation.

Starch is the most consumed food polysaccharide. In order to improve thefunctionalpropertiesof starch, its chemicalstructure is modified. The main objective of this research was to modify wheat and oat starches in order to improve their physicochemicalproperties and to determine the effects of the consequent changesoncrystalline structure, interaction with water, and freeze thaw stability of the starches. Therefore, wheat and oat starches were hydroxypropylated using 30 mL propylen oxide at 40Â°C for 24 h. The results showed that the X-ray diffraction patterns of the modified starches showed no changes and water absorption, solubility and freeze-thaw stability of the modified starches increased, significantly. The hydroxypropylated wheat starch had higher water solubility and freeze thaw stability compared to the hydroxypropylated oat starch.

Abstract
Objective: The present study was carried out to determine the effect of creatine loading on some delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) indices (biochemical, functional and superficial) following resistance exercise in male wrestler.
Methodology: Eighteen volunteer male wrestler (age 21.11±1.13 years, body fat 12.67±1.84 %, and BMI 21.96±0.70 kg.m2) were assigned to a randomized and double-blind into two equal creatine (n=10) and placebo (n=10) groups. After six consecutive days supplementation (300 mg.kg-1.day body weight creatine or dextrose), all subjects were participated in one single- session circuit resistance exercise protocol (with 80% 1-RM in 3 sets with 6 repetition) include six station. Changes in muscle soreness indices were determined in three phases (before supplementation phase, immediately and 24 hours after the resistance exercise protocol). Data were analyzed by repeated measure ANOVA, Bonferroni and independent T test at P?0.05.
Results: The results show that the one-session resistance exercise protocol significantly increased the creatine kinase (CK) and perceived muscle soreness index (P?0.05). Although, the 24-hour of serum CK change ranges in creatine group were significantly less than in placebo group (P?0.05).  While, the 24-hour differences of lower limb’s swelling, flexibility, maximal isometric strength, and explosive   power between two groups were not significant.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the short-term creatine loading leads to attenuate the adverse effects of undesirable muscle soreness indices (serum total CK). Therefore, based on the present results, that creatine loading could reduce the muscle soreness ranges following the resistance exercise.

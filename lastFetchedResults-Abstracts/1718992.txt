The Wilson-plot method has been used for mass transfer correlations and proved to be suitable for systems operating in steady-state conditions and where the only variable is the fluid velocity. A statistically robust Wilson-plot methodology is suggested and proved to be available to calculate the mass transfer coefficients of hollow fiber membranes. This method combines the linear regression analysis and objective function of F-ratios in the analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) table, or coefficient of determination, R2. For the objective function of the optimization problem to find the exponent of velocity, the F-ratio is more suitable than the coefficient of determination. With moderate errors in the measured data, membrane mass transfer coefficients are estimated with small confidence intervals.

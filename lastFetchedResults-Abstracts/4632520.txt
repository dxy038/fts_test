The prediction of the reflection and transmission phenomenon is important for modeling the indoor ultra wideband (UWB) communication environment. This paper develops an approach to analyze the reflection and transmission of UWB signals considering successive reflections inside a finite thickness building wall modeled as a lossy dielectric slab. The UWB signal source is modeled as a point source and when such a source transmits in an indoor environment, the waves impinge on the walls at different angles at different distances. The main objective of this work is to provide an analytical approach for obtaining the arriving angles at the interface of the wall and determine the reflected and transmitted signals taking the effect of the wall into consideration. The properties of the received UWB signal are investigated for different thickness and electrical parameters of the wall.

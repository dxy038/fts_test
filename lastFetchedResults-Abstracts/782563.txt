Herbivores form preferences for substances that raise fitness such as nutritious foods and
avoid those substances, which lower fitness such as plant secondary compounds (PSC).
Nevertheless, some PSC at certain concentrations have the potential to raise fitness as they
act against infective diseases such as parasitism. The objective of the present review is to
assess whether parasitized farm animals are able to manifest self-medicative behaviors.
The ability of herbivores to self-select these medicinal plant compounds emerges from the
inherent adaptive nature of behavioral responses in living organisms. In order to manifest
self-medication animals should experience discomfort caused by a certain illness and
also relief associated with the mitigation of sickness brought about by the ingestion of
a medicinal plant. Observational and controlled studies suggest such conditions, as well
as self-medicative behaviors occur not only in wild but also in domestic herbivores. Selfmedicative
behaviors may allow individuals seek medicinal plant products when infected
by parasites, even at times when the manager is not aware of the existence of parasitism
in the flock. Self-medication may also allow for proper nutrition as animals offered choices
will consume PSC-containing plants as well as nutritious and safe forages. Management
programs should be geared at enhancing in herbivores the likelihood of the association
medicine-relief from sickness and at favoring the transmission of self-medicative behavior
across generations.

In this paper, a compact elliptical shaped UWB fractal antenna is proposed. The excitation is done with a double stepped coplanar waveguide feed. The frequency characteristics of proposed antenna consist of ultra wideband properties in the range 2.85 GHz to 15 GHz corresponding to the impedance bandwidth of 136.13%. The measured radiation patterns are bidirectional in E-plane and Omni-directional in H-plane. The simulated peak gain is 5dBi at 10.6 GHz. The areas of applications are modern wireless communication, penetrating radar, vehicular radar, and medical imaging.

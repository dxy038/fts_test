An optimal design for the RLSA (radial line slot array) antenna useful for DBS reception is presented. Classical geometries and structures given in the literature are first used. It is found that in some cases these are not suitable. So, optimization techniques by using the right objective functions have been applied. Two different methods were developed and three antennas were designed. Numerical results and comparisons with other similar antennas give the advantages of our design

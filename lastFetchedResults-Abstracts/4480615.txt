In this paper, we deal with minimum spanning tree problems where each edge weight is a fuzzy random variable. In order to consider the imprecise nature of the decision makerÂ´s judgment, a fuzzy goal for the objective function is introduced. The problem is to seek a spanning tree maximizing the expectation of a degree of possibility or necessity that the fuzzy goal is satisfied. After showing that the problem to be solved is a minimum ratio spanning tree problem, a polynomial-time algorithm is provided to solve the problem.

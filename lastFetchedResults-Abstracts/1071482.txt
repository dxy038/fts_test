Objective:This study was aimed to examine the effects of "group logotherapy" on reducing the degree of depression between olds. Materials & Methods:The experimental design: pre-post test with control group was used in this study. The population was the female olds of the "house of the oldsters". The samples were selected by means of Beck inventory of depression. Then 20 persons were selected randomly. Then they were assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group was then exposed to 8 sections of group logotherapy. By ending the therapeutic period, both groups were examined by means of the mentioned inventory. Covariance analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient and the test for its meaningfulness were calculated for analyzing the raw data. Results: This finding showed that logotherapy has statistically meaningful effect on curing depression (P  <  0.01) and the scores of depression in experimental group decreased (from 20.8 in pretest to 12.6 in posttest). Conclusion: Group logotherapy has considerable effect on curing depression between olds. Therefore it is necessary to pay more attention to nondrug treatments â€“which are helpful for curing depression between olds.

Background
The number of older adults living in the United States continues to increase, and recent research has begun to target interventions to older adults who have mobility limitations and are at risk for disability. The objective of this study is to describe and examine correlates of health-related quality of life in this population subgroup using baseline data from a larger intervention study.
Methods

The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders-Pilot study (LIFE-P) was a randomized controlled trial that compared a physical activity intervention to a non-exercise educational intervention among 424 older adults at risk for disability. Baseline data (collected in Aprilâ€“December 2004, analyzed in 2006) included demographics, medical history, the Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB-SA), a timed 400-m walk, and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Descriptive health-related quality of life (HRQOL) data are presented. Hierarchical linear regression models were used to examine correlates of HRQOL.
Results

The mean QWB-SA score for the sample was 0.630 on an interval scale ranging from 0.0 (death) to 1.0 (asymptomatic, optimal functioning). The mean of 0.630 is 0.070 lower than a comparison group of healthy older adults. The variables associated with lower HRQOL included white ethnicity, more comorbid conditions, slower 400-m walk times, and lower SPPB balance and chair stand scores.
Conclusions

Older adults who are at risk for disability had reduced HRQOL. Surprisingly, however, mobility was a stronger correlate of HRQOL than an index of comorbidity, suggesting that interventions addressing mobility limitations may provide significant health benefits to this population.

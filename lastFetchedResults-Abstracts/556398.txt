The objective of this study was to determine the best dose and time exposure of Maharloo Artemia cyst in sodium hypochlorite to achieve the highest hatchability rate in decapsulation process. After decapsulation, 2g cyct/L was exposed to 27?C up to hatch for 24h. In the first experiment different doses of sodium hypochlorite include 8, 16, 24, 32 and 40 percent were used. The highest hatching percentage was observed in dose of 32 percent with 85.39±9% (P > 0.05). In the second experiment, different time exposed to dose 32 percent of sodium hypochlorite including 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 minutes were studied. The best percentage hatching rate of 8 79.32±8 was achieved for 4 minutes (P < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that putting Maharloo Artemia cyst in dose of 32 percent hypochlorite for 4 minutes can be reached to the best performance of hatchability for this species which could used for aquacultural purposes.

Objective: The aim of the current study is to investigate the relationship between metacognition and
obsessive beliefs, and procrastination.
Methods: 285 students of Tabriz and Mohaghegh Ardabili Universities, Iran, were selected by random
sampling, and completed the metacognition (MCQ-30) questionnaire, obsessive beliefs questionnaire (OBQ-44),
and General Procrastination Scale. The research method was descriptive. Data was implemented by structural
equation modeling, using Amos software (version 19) and Anderson and Greenbergâ€™s (1988) two-step approach
was followed. First, the model measurement, and then the structural model were examined.
Results: Results showed that obsessive beliefs and metacognitive beliefs, directly and indirectly, predict the
behavior of procrastination. Cognitive confidence, need for control of thoughts, and positive beliefs about worry
from metacognitive beliefs were positively and significantly correlated with procrastination. In addition,
cognitive self-consciousness was inversely correlated with procrastination. Perfectionism/certainty from
obsessive beliefs was inversely correlated with procrastination. Moreover, the relationship between obsessive
beliefs and metacognitive beliefs were positive and significant.
Conclusion: Our findings show a significant relationship between obsessive and metacognitive beliefs and
procrastination. To reduce behaviors of procrastination, control of obsessive beliefs and metacognition seems to
be necessary. Moreover, controlling and shaping metacognitive beliefs can be effective in reducing compulsive
behavior.

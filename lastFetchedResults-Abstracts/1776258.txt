Inroduction & Objective: Fennel is a plant with scientific name Feoniculum vulgare that belong to Apiaceae family. This plant has many pharmaceutical effects which one of the best important uses is increasing of lactation. The essential oil of fennel contains trans anethole, estragole, fenchone and limonene. This study investigated the effect of fennel extract on male Balb/C mice testis histology.
Materials and Methods: As first, samples separated full casually, as five groups and in any of group eight samples as experimental groups 1, 2, 3 and two groups, control and placebo, respectively, which kept in the same conditions. Fennel hydro-ethanolic extract provided in different doses. (25, 50, 100 mg/kg/2day) and injected intraperitonealy for 20 days to treated groups and normal saline were injected to placebo group (zero dose).
Results: These groups compared with control group. The number of primary spermatocytes and assess of histological properties were done with provided sections of seminiferous tubules and with use light microscope. The results indicated that number of primary spermatocytes and spermatozoids significantly can be decreased in dose of  50 and 100 mg/kg/2day in comparison with other groups.  The results of this research indicated the negative effect of fennel extract on male reproductive system because number of sexual cells decreased significantly.

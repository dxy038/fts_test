Based on the least absolute criteria, the image reconstruction problem is transformed into an optimization one by constructing the objective function for optimization. The optimization problem is transformed into the separable optimization problem to be solved by using the alternating direction method. At the same time, a new CT image reconstruction algorithm is got by combining with ART algorithm. Experimental results show that the algorithm is better than ART algorithm in obviously improving reconstruction quality, and as a result, the image signal to noise ratio has increased significantly.

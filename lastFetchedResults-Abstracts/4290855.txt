The bandwidth allocation problem in ATM networks is NP-complete. This paper presents a novel generalized particle approach (GPA) to optimize the bandwidth allocation and QoS parameter for ATM networks. The GPA transforms the optimization of ATM networks into a kinematics and dynamics of numerous particles in a force-field. The GPA has many advantages in terms of the higher parallelism, multi-objective optimization, multi-type coordination, and easiness for hardware implementation. During the ATM networks optimization, the GPA may deal with a variety of random and emergent phenomena, such as the congestion, failure, and interaction. This paper also gives the GPAÂ´s properties regarding its correctness, convergency and stability. The simulations have shown the effectiveness and suitability of the GPA to the optimization of ATM networks

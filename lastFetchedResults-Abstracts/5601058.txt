Trust mechanism is an important precondition in realization of grid security. To improve the traditional trust evaluation models, a trust mechanism in grid based on grey system theory is put forward. In this mechanism, neighbor nodes of the resource node with higher recommendation trusts are chosen as marking nodes, detailed process for construction of recommendation trust routes is presented. and the corresponding recommendation trust is used as their own evaluation weight. Meanwhile, time decay is introduced to update the mark matrix, which provides more objective and reliable evaluation.

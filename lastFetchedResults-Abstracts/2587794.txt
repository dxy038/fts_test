This study was designed to find out the impact of the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) of the tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFRSF1B) on pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) risk in an Iranian population. This case-control study was done on 159 PTB patients and 158 healthy subjects. Bi-allelic TNFRSF1B VNTR was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression analysis revealed no significant association between TNFRSF1B VNTR and PTB risk (P>0.05). Our findings proposed that TNFRSF1B VNTR polymorphism is unlikely to confer susceptibility to PTB.

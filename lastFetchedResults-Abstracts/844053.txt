This paper presents synchronization scheme for time-delayed linearly bidirectionally coupled chaotic Chen’s system.
The method is based on linear stability analysis of hyperbolic fixed point. Here we derive a generic condition of global
chaos synchronization for time-delayed chaotic Chen’s system with linearly bidirectional coupling. The behavior of the
system with and without coupling are demonstrated by numerical simulation.

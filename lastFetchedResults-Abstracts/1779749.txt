Several genes involved in the metabolism of carcinogenesis have been found to be polymorphic in the human population, and specific alleles are associated with increase risk of cancer of various sites. This study is focused on the polymorphic enzymes glutathione-S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and T1 (GSTT1) that involved in the detoxification of many xenobiotics involved in the etiology of prostate cancer. Objective. To evaluate whether GSTM1 and/or GSTT1 contribute to prostate cancer (CaP) etiology, we studied 110 incident CaP cases and 122 controls. Results. The probability of having CaP was increased in men who had homozygous deleted (non-functional) genotypes at GSTT1 (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1–3.79) but not GSTM1 (OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.66–1.88). Hence, individuals lacking the GSTT1 gene are at approximately twofold higher risk of developing prostate cancer in comparison with individuals with at least one active allele in the GSTT1 locus. Conclusion. These results suggest that GSTT1 is associated with CaP risk. The effect of smoking associated with the GSTT10/0 genotype was not found to affect the risk of prostate cancer.

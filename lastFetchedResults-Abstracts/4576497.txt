Our work is related to the ecological state of Lake Ohrid. Tectonic by origin, Lake Ohrid is situated in the southwestern part of the Republic of Macedonia. The size of the lake is 358 square kilometers. Its average depth is 151m and the maximum depth is 289m. "Man-made" eutrophication, in the absence of control measures, proceeds much faster than the natural phenomenon and it is the major reason for pollution of this lake. A dynamic integrated monitoring system (DIMS) was presented previously which is based on online measurements. One of the main objectives of DIMS is to provide a real-time monitoring and efficient protection of the environment. A 3D based analysis of the data from DIMS is given. The main objective is to show how the critical pollution sources in the Lake Ohrid can be presented and analysed by using visualization methods. ESRI 3-D software (ARC/INFO, Arc View Spatial Analyst &amp; Arc View 3D Analyst) for virtual modelling and visualization was used in our work.

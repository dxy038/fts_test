Semantic Web (SW) languages are supposed to be compatible with each other in a meaningful way, so as to facilitate machine understanding. Recent research, however, shows that the semantics of the standard SW annotation language RDF (as well as its ontological extension RDFS) and that of the standard SW ontology language OWL DL are not compatible with each other. This paper investigates some issues behind this incompatibility and proposes a novel modification of RDF(S) as a firm semantic foundation for many of the latest description logics-based SW ontology languages, including OWL DL. Furthermore, the bidirectional one-to-one mapping between RDFS(FA) axioms in strata 0-2 and OWL DL axioms has been established, which enables RDFS(FA)-agents and OWL DL-agents to communicate with each other more easily. As a result, the introduction of RDFS(FA) clarifies the vision of the semantic Web and solidifies RDF(S)Â´s proposed role as the base of the semantic Web

It is well known that in theory 41% more sunlight is available by tracking the PV module to follow the daily course of the sun, relative to fixed installations. The overall objective of this study is to develop a control algorithm that improved performance and reliability the two-axis solar tracker. To achieve this goal, this study concentrate on optimizing the LM3S811 based controller board, drive hardware and the software.

Edge preservation ratio (EPR) is a full-reference metric for objective image quality assessment (IQA). It is under the assumption that key messages to human visual systems are mainly from image structures, and these structures can be extracted by edge detection. EPR measure is twofold: accuracy and robustness, and a color map is synthesized to reveal structure changes before and after image processing. The feasibility and superiority of EPR have been validated via image magnification and noise reduction. Experimental results suggest that: (1) it is challenging to fully recover lost messages by image magnification; (2) high image contrast may be derived from concise and distinct image structures.

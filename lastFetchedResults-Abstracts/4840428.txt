The dynamic stability of structure is attracting more and more attention. How to control the dynamic instability effectively is a new subject; piezoelectric smart structure makes itpsilas possible. The research of dynamic stability involves some subjects, and was developed recent decades. The birth of intelligent structure gives a new way of the active control for the dynamic instability. In smart structure, piezoelectric material is adhered to the structure surface or in laid inside the structure, and it influences the static and dynamic characteristics of the structure by changing the rigidity matrix and mass matrix. The distribution of control force is determined by the optimization of piezoelectric material, so as to realize its control objective. Fully considering the multi-objective optimal control on the performance, layout, position and length of piezoelectric stack, the paper researches the working principle and introduces the structural style with the view of the piezoelectric stack optimization of hinged-hinged intelligent active-member, which provides the design basis for realizing the stability control of smart structure.

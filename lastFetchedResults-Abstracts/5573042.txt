Range scanning sensors are widely used to achieve perception-related automation functions. This paper presents an evaluation study of two RaDAR and four LiDAR range scanning sensors with the objective of characterizing their capabilities and limitations for surface mining automation applications. A methodology is presented that evaluates sensors by their capability to meet the requirements of candidate applications. Applications described include terrain mapping, determining vehicle position and orientation and personnel identification.

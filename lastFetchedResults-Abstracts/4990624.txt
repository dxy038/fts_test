Development of an Electronic Stability Control using individual brake force distribution based on tire force information was presented in this paper. The objective of the proposed ESC algorithm is to determine the individual brake forces to improve the performance of the controller. This ESC algorithm consists of an upper level controller and a lower level controller. The upper level controller calculates the desired yaw moment for satisfying the driverÂ´s intention. The lateral dynamic model can be more accurate by getting rid of the uncertainties caused by complex tire model. In the lower level controller, the individual braking forces are determined by the optimal strategy. The closed loop computer simulation results with driver-vehicle-controller system confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control system and the improvements in vehicle stability.

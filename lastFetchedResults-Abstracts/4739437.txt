In order to arrange the generators between hydrogenerators and themeturbine, the water data need to be sent to dispatch staffs timely. The daily submitted water data are intensive. And the dispatch staffs are pressured. Because the above objective conditions might lead to human error problems during the water submit processing, an artificial intelligence method of hydrological data validation and analysis based on neural network ensemble (NNE) is proposed. And a software based on this method are finished. It can improve the efficiency of dispatch staffs, and also can ensure the correct rate of water data submitted. The application results of daily water system data show the effectiveness and practicality of the method and the software.

Multi-modal transport of full loads with time limit is a complex problem. Its organization mode, which is link-up multimodal transport, and business process were probed into. Then, the virtual transport network is constructed for multimodal transport selection. Finally, a combination optimal model for multimodal transport of full loads with time windows is presented. Multi-objective genetic algorithm of random weighting is adopted as the optimization method, combined with MATLAB7.0 programming for calculation. A case study shows it can decrease the transport cost by 44.72% to 84.45%, and duration by 25% to 50%.

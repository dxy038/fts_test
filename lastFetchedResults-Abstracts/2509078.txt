Office buildings in the construction sector are the largest consumer of energy. So providing solutions for energy efficiency, improving performance and correcting the operation pattern can reduce energy consumption and improve occupants comfort in these buildings. Using Design builder and CFD simulation software and recording devices, the study has analyzed the environment quality parameters (temperature, humidity and air pressure) to calculate the amount of energy required in a smart building. First the current state of the environment is evaluated. In the next steps the building energy bills analyzed, also simulation and calculation of building loads and ultimately provide solutions to energy audits and energy efficiency of buildings have been discussed. The objective of this study is to review ways to reduce energy consumption in such buildings. The simulation in this study shows that with proper planning and management of energy consumption in intelligent office buildings, there is a possibility of reducing more than 35 to 40% of annual energy consumption. However the most of the savings are in the cooling and lighting sectors in such buildings.

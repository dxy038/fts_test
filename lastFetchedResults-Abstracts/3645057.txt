The goal of developing agrometeorological crop model inputs from remotely sensed information (AgRISTARS Early Warning/Crop Condition Assessment Project Subtask 5 within the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)) provided a focus and a mission for crop spectral investigations that would have been lacking otherwise. Because the task had never been attempted before, much effort has gone into developing measurement and interpretation skill, convincing the Scientific community of the validity and information content of the spectral measurements, and providing new understanding of the crop scenes viewed as affected by bidirectional, atmospheric, and soil background variations. Nonetheless, experiments conducted demonstrate that spectral vegetation indices (VI) a) are an excellent measure of the amount of green photosynthetically active tissue present in plant stands at any time during the season, and b) can reliably estimate leaf area index (LAI) and intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR)-two of the inputs needed in agrometeorological models. Progress was also made on using VI to quantify the effects of yield-detracting stresses on crop canopy development. In a historical perspective, these are significant accomplishments in a short time span. Spectral observations of fields from aircraft and satellite make direct checks on LAI and IPAR predicted by the agrometeorological models feasible and help extend the models to large areas. However, newness of the spectral interpretations, plus continual revisions in agrometeorological models and lack of feedback capability in them, have prevented the benefits of spectral inputs to agrometeorological models from being fully realized.

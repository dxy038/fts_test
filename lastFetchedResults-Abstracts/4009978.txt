Video forgery, also referred as video falsifying, is a technique for generating fake videos by altering, combining, or creating new video contents. For instance, the outcome of a 100 m race in the olympic game is forged as an example in this paper. We track objects and segment motions using a modified mean shift mechanism. The resulting video layers can be played in different speeds and from different reference points with respect to the original video. In order to obtain a smooth movement of target objects, a motion interpolation mechanism is proposed based on reference stick figures (i.e., a structure of human skeleton) and a video inpainting mechanism. The video inpainting mechanism is performed in a quasi-3-D space via guided 3-D patch matching. Interpolated target objects and background layers are then fused. The objective is to create a forged video, which is almost indistinguishable from the original video. We demonstrate the original and the forged videos in our Web site at http://member.mine.tku.edu.tw/www/TSMC09/. Although video forgery may create moral or legal issues, which is beyond the scope of this paper, our intension is to create special effects in video editing applications.

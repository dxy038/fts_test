In the literature there are many empirical studies to evaluate techniques for automatic structural test case generation. However, there isnÂ´t a systematic study about the kind of experiments that are conducted to automate the process. The main objective of this paper is the classification and thematic analysis of the experiments reported in the literature to increase the efficacy and efficiency of the automation of structural testing and a classification of the techniques for generating test data. The methodology is a systematic mapping study. The results indicate that the experiments are mainly focused in three areas (test data generation, reduction of test suites and techniques for dealing with complex structures of programs), and that there are different combined approaches to make the generation more effective and efficient.

<p><strong><em>B</em></strong><strong><em>ackg</em></strong><strong><em>r</em></strong><strong><em>oun</em></strong><strong><em>d</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Multi-drug resistant strains of <em>Acinetobacter </em>spp. have created therapeutic problems worldwide. The objective of this study was to detect integrons  in <em>Acinetobacter  </em>spp. isolates  from Ventilator-Associated  Pneu- monia patients using PCR method.<br /><strong><em>Me</em></strong><strong><em>t</em></strong><strong><em>ho</em></strong><strong><em>d</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong>: </strong>A total 51 Bronchoalveolar lavage samples were obtained from patients in ICU and examined for <em>Acinetobacter </em>spp. infection by biochemical and PCR methods using <em>bla</em>OXA51-like primers. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion and MIC methods.<br /><strong><em>R</em></strong><strong><em>e</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong><em>u</em></strong><strong><em>lt</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Among 51 patients with VAP (62.7% males, 35.2% females, mean age 53 year), 50 (98%) were positive, with a high prevalence of gram-nega- tive bacteria, mainly <em>Acinetobacter </em>spp. (70%), from which <em>A</em>. <em>baumani </em>was detected in 34 (68%) and <em>A. lwoffii </em>in 1 (2%) of isolates. More than 90% of isolates were resistant to imipenem,  piperacillin+tazobactam,  third genera- tion cephalosporins and gentamicin, while the most effective antibiotic was colistin (100%). The correlation coefficient between disk diffusion and MIC was 0.808 (<em>p </em>= 0.001). Three Acinetobacter isolates (8%) harbored <em>integrase I </em>gene but none of isolates contained Class II or III integrons.<br /><strong><em>C</em></strong><strong><em>onc</em></strong><strong><em>l</em></strong><strong><em>u</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong><em>i</em></strong><strong><em>o</em></strong><strong><em>n</em></strong><strong>: </strong>The results showed that colistin was an effective antibiotic and can be used for treatment  of patients in ICU. Due to the high number of MDR isolates lacking Integrons it can be concluded that although class I in- tegrons are important among clinical isolates of <em>A. baumannii</em>, they have no significant  role  in  dissemination  of  antibiotic  resistance  genes  in  Rasoul Akram  Hospital in Tehran, Iran. The presence of <em>IntI </em>in <em>A. </em><em>l</em><em>w</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>f</em><em>i</em><em>i </em>may be related to transfer of integron to <em>A. baumannii </em>which can be considered as an important threat for hospitalized patients.</p>

Auxiliary loads, such as lighting systems, electric motors, air compressor, pumps, fans, and other electric loads, reduce the fuel economy of conventional internal combustion engine (ICE), hybrid, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Hybrid technology makes use of electric energy stored in batteries to power the drive train of a vehicle and increase the fuel economy, but it also comes with a high price tag. The air conditioner is the single most demanding auxiliary load that significantly reduces fuel economy. The objective of this work is to evaluate the fuel economy improvement and economic feasibility of installing an additional battery pack on a city transit bus to supply power to the air conditioner and other auxiliary loads without any power train hybridization.

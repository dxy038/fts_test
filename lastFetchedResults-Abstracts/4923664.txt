Operation expenditures for electrical networks are mainly caused by costs of resources, e. g. field service personnel, agency staff, material and tools. These resources are required for executing processes for maintenance, fault clearance as well as for investment projects. The network operatorpsilas resource allocation strategy for operating the network strongly depends on available resources and long-term planning of predictable processes. This paper presents a newly developed method for optimizing resources for the operation of electrical networks. For this, all relevant influencing factors on resource allocation, e.g. uncertain fault occurrences or stochastic durations of processes, have to be considered. As a result, minimal costs for operating the network may be quantified for network system operators in an objective manner. Functionality and practicality of the developed method are shown exemplarily based on a data set for maintenance and fault clearance for 65 high voltage substations.

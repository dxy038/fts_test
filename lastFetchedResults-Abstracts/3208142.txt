Low voltage ride through capability augmentation of a hybrid micro-grid system is presented in this paper which reflects enhanced reliability in the system. The control scheme involves parallel connected multiple ac-dc bidirectional converters. When the micro-grid system is subjected to a severe voltage dip by any transient fault single power converter may not be able to provide necessary reactive power to overcome the severe voltage dip. This paper discusses the control strategy of additional power converter connected in parallel with main converter to support extra reactive power to withstand the severe voltage dip. During transient fault, when the terminal voltage crosses 90% of its pre-fault value, additional converter comes into operation. With the help of additional power converter, the micro-grid system withstands the severe voltage fulfilling the grid code requirements. This multiple converter scheme provides the micro-grid system the capability of low voltage ride through which makes the system more reliable and stable.

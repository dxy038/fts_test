Providing security and assurance to information systems and communications is one of the highest national priorities. It is our task to prepare computer information system security professionals with current security and assurance information to achieve this objective. To meet this urgent need, the faculty must have the knowledge and skills to be taught in the classroom. For several semesters, we have been developing information system security curriculum with a computer forensics course for the students. Active participation in real life security problems is a great opportunity to learn the subject matter. This paper describes one of our positive experiences.

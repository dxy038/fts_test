The inherent complexity of large scale power system makes the optimization problems very complicated for power system planning and operation. Ordinal optimization theory is developed to efficiently find good enough solutions with high probability for simulation-based optimization problems. Vector ordinal optimization theory is particularly useful in finding a good enough solution subset for multi-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we illustrate the principles of the ordinal optimization theory and the vector ordinal optimization theory, and also discuss the potential applications of the theories in power system optimization problems

Biosignal processing and analysis is a field of great importance in current medical practice. In recent years, biomedical engineers have developed many algorithms and processing techniques in order to help doctors in the examination of many different biosignals, and to find new information embedded in them and not easily observable in the raw data. Since the number and variety of these techniques grows every day, it is becoming more and more difficult to be up to date in biosignal processing. Other aspects such as signals format, algorithms implementation and comparison, artifacts, etc, make the learning process in this field longer and longer, and in many occasions a lot of different software tools are needed to visualize or process biosignals. In this paper we present a program that consists of many of the current typical biosignal processing algorithms: filtering, domain transforms, basic operators, wave detection, and unlike other similar applications, it includes a pattern recognition block. The program can also be used just to exchange signals formats. The objective of this program is to become a usual tool both for medical practice and for biomedical educational purposes.

It is noted that high-contrast ratios coupled with square pixel shape can make stair-step distortion easily noticeable (without antialiasing) on a medium-resolution dot-matrix display (64 pixel/in.). Eighteen USAF pilots evaluated two dot-matrix approach/landing formats (with stair-step distortion) while flying approaches in a fixed base simulator. Conventional HSI (horizontal situation indicator) and FLIP chart were used as a performance baseline. No statistically significant differences were found in objective pilot performance and workload data that could be directly attributed to stair-step distortion. Performance differences were found that could be attributed to format information content and display scale factor (pixels per degree). Questionnaire data show that pilots view stair-step distortion as moderately distracting in a few instances, sometimes only marginally distracting, and generally without impact

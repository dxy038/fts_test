In this study, a novel soft switching method for multiport bidirectional DC/DC converter is proposed. As a case study, the design and performance of a grid connected photovoltaic system with battery backup storage are investigated. This test system is perfectly suitable for smart applications in the modern power systems. The soft switching (zero voltage switching (ZVS)) capability operates over a wide operating range, without the requirement of auxiliary circuits. This is seen as the main advantage of the presented method for controlling the DC/DC converter. A centralised control strategy, including maximum power point tracking, power flow management and interfacing with the utility are evaluated. Theoretical results are verified by simulation and experimental results for a three-port DC/DC converter.

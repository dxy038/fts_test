This paper presents a bidirectional lateral IGBT on SOI for IC integration exhibiting symmetrical output performance suitable for high frequency applications. The device structure is obtained by reflecting a typical DMOS on the anode side, thus introducing a gate controlled anode short. The short avoids the typical trade-off problem of conduction-loss versus blocking capability at high temperatures. Turn-off speed is improved by a factor of 3, while the maximum controllable current is about 50% higher at 125&#176;C

Ferula assa-foetida L. is on of most important medicinal plant. The genus Ferula belongs to the Apiaceae family grow in Iran and Afghanistan. The objective of this study was to assess the genetic variation in germplasm of Ferula assa-foetida collected from two provinces in southeast of Iran using RAPD marker. The Ferula assa-foetida leave were collected from 30 various regions in Kerman and Yazd provinces. DNA was extracted from leave using modified CTAB method. From the 15 used primers in PCR, 10 primers with better bands were selected for analysis. The127polymorphic bands obtained by these primers were scored. The binary matrix was converted to distance matrix by applying Dice similarity coefficient in NTSYS-pc (Ver 2.02) software. Then, the distance matrix was analyzed using (UPGMA) and the phyllogenic dendrogram was plotted. Based on the results, investigated populations were clustered in5 groups. The obtained clusters based on RAPD markers to some extent matched with the geographical origin of the studied populations of Ferula assa-foetida. Furthermore, the obtained results of principal component analysis method were similar to the results of cluster analysis. The results indicated that RAPD technique is an efficient tool for assessing genetic diversity in these populations.

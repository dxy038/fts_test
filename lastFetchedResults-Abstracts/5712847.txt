This paper presents evolutionary computing technique for solving constrained reactive power control (CRPC) problem in the attempt to enhance voltage stability under contingencies, while minimizing transmission loss and maintaining voltage level at an acceptable level. In this study, evolutionary programming (EP) was chosen as the evolutionary computing (EC) technique for solving the CRPC; taking into consideration two separate objective functions. Static voltage stability enhancement and minimization of real power loss are implemented separately on a reliability test system. Comparative studies performed with respect to artificial immune system (AIS) have highlighted that EP outperformed AIS for both objective functions.

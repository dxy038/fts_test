The main objective of this paper is devoted to develop a new direct method in piecewise solution of large interconnected power systems through large change sensitivity (LCS) concept. Irrespective of LCS concept, bus-tearing is another distinctive aspect of the proposed method respect to the previously schemes. This eliminates the need to employ bus reordering and use temporary slack buses, which complicate the problem solution procedure. The proposed method presents a high level of flexibility in the number and size of the torn subnetworks, provided synchronous communication. It can be implemented whether on tightly or loosely coupled multicomputer systems. This method is developed here for fast decoupled load flow (FDLF) as the most common power system´s computations, but isn´t restricted to it. It has the same convergence characteristics with the original untorn FDLF. LCS-based FDLF can be exploit from the conventional FDLF by making trivial changes.

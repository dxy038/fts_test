Partial discharge (PD) is a small electrical spark that occurs within the electrical insulation of transformers, switchgears, cables, and windings in large motors and generators. The objective of this work is to design and use a multipurpose radiofrequency (RF) antenna that can detect the PD in transformer´s oil and monitor the oil´s quality. Upon the occurrence of a PD, an electromagnetic wave is generated. This wave travels in different directions and propagates through the transformer´s oil. Additionally, the same antenna can be connected to a simple microwave radiometer circuit to evaluate the oil quality.

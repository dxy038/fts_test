<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Depressed coronary artery disease (CAD) patients may experience a poorer prognosis than non-depressed patients. The aim of this study was to find the associated factors for depressive symptoms in young adults with CAD.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Method:</strong> This was a cross-sectional study within Tehran Heart Center's Premature Coronary Atherosclerosis Cohort (THC-PAC) study. Young adult CAD patients (men ≤ 45 year-old and women ≤ 55 year-old) were visited from March 2013 to February 2014. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and all patients were asked to fill in the Beck Depression Inventory II. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. A logistic regression model was used to find multiple associated factors of depressive symptoms.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Seven hundred seventy patients (mean ±SD age: 45.34 ±5.75 y, men: 47.7%) were visited. The point prevalence of depressive symptoms was 46.9% in women and 30.2% in men (p &lt; 0.001). Logistic regressions model revealed that the most important associated factors for depressive symptoms in the male premature CAD patients were opium usage (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.33-4.43), major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.17-3.93), initial coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) treatment (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.07-4.06), positive family history for CAD (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.11-3.01) and cigarette smoking (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.97-2.98). Hypertension showed a protective role in this group of patients (OR = 0.5, CI = 0.29-0.92). In the female patients, hypertension (OR = 1.5, CI = 0.96-2.22) and body mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.1, CI = 1.02-1.10) were associated with depressive symptoms.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In premature CAD male patients, opium usage, MACE, initial CABG treatment, positive family history for CAD and cigarette smoking were associated with depressive symptoms; and hypertension and BMI were associated with depressive symptoms in women.</p>

This paper presents an optimization controller for three-phase induction motor. In this controller, Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization MOPSO is implemented to tackle all the conflicting goals that define the problem. This paper deals with two conflicting objective functions. These conflicting functions are: 1. Maximize the efficiency of the drive system, and 2. Maximize the power factor of the induction motor. The proposed technique are based on the principle that the flux level in a machine can be adjusted to give the trade-off solution of maximum efficiency and maximum power factor for a given value of speed and load torque. The optimum flux levels are function of the machine load and speed requirements. Simulation results show that considerable efficiency and power factor improvements are achieved using MOPSO when compared with the Field Oriented Control (FOC) and Constant Voltage to Frequency Ratio Control (CVFRC).

The paper focuses on the problem of electrical consumption mode control of an industrial plant´s electric power system with distributed generation. The problem is important due to the necessity of upgrade of existing power supply systems and power efficiency improvement. In spite of this the integration of the small-scale and medium-scale energy sources looks promising.The methods of power flow computation for an industrial plant´s distribution network with generators have been compared. It is drawn that the Gauss-Seidel method performs best for this application.The efficiency of the evolutionary algorithm for the solution of the power system with local energy sources optimization problem is shown.The curves of industrial plant´s distribution network power losses versus generator´s parameters are provided.The objective function of the given optimization problem and the constraints for normal operation of the power system have been carried out.The algorithm for the design of optimal structure and parameters of an industrial plant´s power system with distributed generation has been proposed. Based on the Gauss-Seidel method and evolutionary algorithm it provides minimum of power losses for maximum and minimum load modes.

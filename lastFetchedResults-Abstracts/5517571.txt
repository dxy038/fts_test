Base on the characteristics of discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm (DPSO) and interior point method (IPM), a hybrid strategy algorithm (HSA) for the weak voltage areas recovery problem is proposed. Take the sensitivity analysis results and the minimum network loss rate as the objective function, considering constraint function, then according to the different nature of the optimization variables, the original problem is decomposed into a continuous optimization sub-problem and a discrete optimization sub-problem, which are solved by interior point method and discrete particle swarm algorithm respectively. By solving the two sub-problems alternately, IPM and DPSO take advantage of each other, to ensure the efficiency of the integrated optimization, and make the optimization process reflect situation more realistic in power system. The HSA applied for weak voltage areas recovery is evaluated on an IEEE 30-bus power system, simulation results proved its correctness and effectiveness.

The main objective of biometrics is to identify or authenticate an individual, given his/her different physical or behavioral characteristics. This approach has already been employed in our daily life in various applications and forms (USB biometric key, access control, ...). Nevertheless, this technology could be used for multiple other applications. In this presentation, we survey the trends that have been observed for the proliferation of this technology such as: definitions of contemporary unconstrained biometric systems that necessitate or call for low cost sensors and few steps for enrollment (some examples based on face, veins and keystroke dynamics will illustrate this point); evaluation of biometric systems that take into account performance, acceptability, and security; and privacy related applications, such as those in biohashing techniques.

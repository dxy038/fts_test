Femtocells can be employed as the low-power &#8220;green&#8221; wireless-access points to extend the macrocell network coverage and enhance the quality-of-service inside homes. In this paper, we focus on the joint subchannel allocation and transmitting-power control for femtocells during the downlink transmissions. Our objective is to minimize the total transmitting power across femtocell access points (FAPs) to facilitate &#8220;green&#8221; mobile communications. We would like to minimize the following criteria: (1) each userÂ´s received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) per subchannel and (2) the number of subchannels each femtocell user requires to maintain a reliable quality-ofservice (QoS). Meanwhile, the interference of the users in the underlying femtocells to users in other macrocells should also be restricted. Thus, a new pertinent optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is very complicated to solve in practice. In our work, a reformulation-linearization technique (RLT) based on a branchand-bound framework is invoked to simplify the aforementioned MINLP. Finally, simulation results are demonstrated for the effectiveness of our proposed new scheme.

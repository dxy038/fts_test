In this paper, A new method basing on the Life Cycle Cost(LCC) theory is introduced to optimize concrete bridge maintenance plan. Taking concrete structure of bridge as example and considering various factors, such as external environment, load and structure material,deterioration process of bridge structure is analyzed and predicted. In addition, multi-objective optimization model with maintenance method of the structures and the corresponding time interval as optimization variables, while minimization of LCC and deterioration rate and maximization of service life as optimization objectives is put forward. The improved NSGA-II (GNSGA-II) is adopted to solve the optimization model. Both for maintenance management to completed projects and formulation of maintenance plan to new project, this model can make cost analysis and optimization for effective utilization and saving social fund.

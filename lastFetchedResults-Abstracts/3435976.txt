Sufficient conditions for the input-output stability (BIBO stability) of time-varying nonlinear multiloop feedback systems are established. The present objective is to analyze large-scale systems in terms of their lower order subsystems (subloops) and in terms of their interconnecting structure. Both time-domain and frequency-domain results are presented. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the present approach, two specific examples are considered.

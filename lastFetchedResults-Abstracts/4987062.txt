Overhead power lines are the prevailing facilities to carry electric energy along big distances. Their proper functioning is very important for the current society due our highly electrical-dependent lifestyle. During their working, overhead power lines are under different phenomena, such as short-circuits, high-speed winds, extreme temperature conditions and impacts, which can disturb their operation and even prevent them to accomplish their objective. As a result, many simulation tools are being presented to analyze the evolution in those situations. This paper presents an application of an electrodynamics simulation tool. This application shows a transient evolution for a given overhead power line during an open-close sequence because of a persistent short-circuit, as well as, a long-time study considering current and environmental temperature variations.

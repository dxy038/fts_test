Objective-Smoking remains the single most important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and also the leading preventable cause of death. There have been a good many studes on the association between demographic variables and smoking rate in urban areas; however, very little has been done in rural areas. Methods- This cross-sectional study was conducted on 1375 individuals randomly selected from those residing in the villages of Bandar Abbas. Data were collected by questionnaires and were analyzed by SPSS-11. Results- 55.5 percent of the study group were female. Twenty-two percent were single and 74 percent were married. Eighty percent of them had some level of education up to high school. 15 percent had history of cigarette smoking and 22 percent had history of hobble use. Fortytwo percent of those who had history of cigarette smoking consumed more than 10 cigarettes per day. Smoking was significantly more prevalent among males, married and loweducational subjects. The smoking rate increased with the increase in age up to 40 years old in the total population and the male subgroup, but there was no association between age and smoking rate in the females. The hookah consumption rate was significantly more prevalent in the females and married individuals with low educational status and older age groups. This association was significant in the male and female subgroups, but hookah consumption rate decreased after 60 years of age in the males. Conclusion- According to this study the most important modifiable demographic factor for smoking rate was low educational status, therefore increasing the educational status in rural areas can decrease smoking rate and also cardiovascular diseases in the rural population (Iranian Heart Journal 2007; 8 (4):29 -34).

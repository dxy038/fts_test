The US Dept. of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Improvement Program (DAIP) specifically considers the reliability and maintainability of weapon and command &amp; control systems, and thus has significant R&amp;M implications. Its comprehensiveness naturally introduces conflicting objectives. Implementation guidance offered in connection with specific management and system design principles adds further complications. Key DoD policymakers are not unanimous in their support of DAIP specifics nor are the separate Services. Furthermore, change is never easy, especially when institutional inertia as great as that found in DoD is involved. After studying the program directives, instructions, and guidelines, my conclusions and recommendations are as follows. 1. The objective is to require the Services to develop acquisition strategies for system acquisitions. 2. The specifics of the strategies and the processes are designed to enhance readiness, reduce costs, shorten acquisition time, and stabilize the procurement system. 3. Acquisition strategies encompass the entire process for the system, preplanned product improvement, and post-production support. 4. Approaches to these process improvements are still being worked out and therefore in a state of transition. 5. R&amp;M (reliability &amp; maintainability) aspects have neither received sufficient implementation attention nor has their interrelationship with the other program provisions been adequately assessed. 6. Preplanned product (P3I) improvement introduces a new wrinkle into R&amp;M activities. Traditional program tasks will need to be applied, consistent with the incremental, technology insertion philosophy of this acquisition improvement initiative. 7. R&amp;M growth must become an element of P3I in the approved acquisition strategy.

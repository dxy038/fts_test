Objective: A novel konjac glucomannan-based adsorbent - sulfated konjac glucomannan gel beads (KGMSB) was prepared to selectively adsorb low-density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL+VLDL-C) from blood plasma in vitro. 0.5 g of KGMSB was used to adsorb 1.0 mL of blood plasma at 37degC in a shaker at the speed of 200 rpm for 2 h. The adsorption amounts and adsorption rates were determined. The in vitro static adsorption behavior of the KGMSB was investigated by the curve of adsorption kinetics and the sorption rate equation. The adsorption amounts for total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL+VLDL-C were (106.49plusmn3.56) mug/g, (9.01plusmn2.86) mug/g and (98.32plusmn2.21) mug/g, and the adsorption rates were (62.05plusmn1.78) %, (19.20+-6.07) % and (78.14plusmn1.73) % respectively. Analysis of the curve of adsorption kinetics indicated that LDL+VLDL-C were absorbed due to the electrostatic interaction and the molecular sieve effect. The prior adsorption for LDL+VLDL-C may also be the results of the LDL+VLDL- C competing adsorption sites during the adsorption processes. Langmuir sorption rate equation can be used to imitate the static adsorption process for LDL+VLDL-C and HDL-C of KGMSB. Conclusions: KGMSB can selectively adsorb LDL+VLDL-C from blood plasma in vitro, it is a potential material to be developed into a novel blood LDL adsorbent.

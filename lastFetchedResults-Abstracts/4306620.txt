Switch mode rectifiers are becoming more and more interesting in those applications where bidirectional power flow, power factor correction and EMI reduction are required. However, in order to obtain low cost systems, the number of sensors should be reduced. Therefore, in this paper, a current-sensorless feed-forward fuzzy logic controller is presented and discussed. The mathematical description of the system and the design of the fuzzy-logic controller are introduced and analysed, then its implementation on a general-purpose microcontroller and experimental results are reported and discussed.

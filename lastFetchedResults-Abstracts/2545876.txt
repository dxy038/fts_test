His different manner in dealing with method, subject, bibliography and writing has attracted the public attention from one side, and has caused different reactions in academic historiography from the other side. Therefore, it is impossible to ignore his influence on the field of history writing and the promotion development of its reading. To reach out to his mental space and finding his points of view about history and the methods of historiography, this article is to reveal his concepts on historical ontology, epistemology and methodology (paradigm) to determine the world-view ruling the historian's mind and the causes and reasons of his special applications in historiography â€“ from subject selecting up to the bibliography and the style of writing. The inductive study of his works shows three dimensions of his historiography paradigm; in a way that he reaches none-positivist epistemology from idealistic ontology and believed, in his methodology, that the existence of monopolized objective and experimental tools are insufficient in history understanding.

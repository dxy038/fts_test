The supply chain partnersÂ´ selection is the foundation of supply chain cooperation movement. The evaluating and choosing of partners have the characteristic of multi indexes, and the attributes, the important degree and the comparability of indexes are different. That makes the evaluating and choosing of supply chain partners be obviously uncertain. This paper uses the improved gray relation projection which is improved by using resolution coefficient of different partners and combining weighted method connected by methods of entropy and analytic hierarchy process to make the evaluating and choosing of supply chain partners be more objective, fair and accurate.

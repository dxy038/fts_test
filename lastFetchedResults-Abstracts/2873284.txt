Last-Level Cache (LLC) plays an important role in Chip Multi-Processor (CMP). The objective of this work is to optimize the structure and management strategy of LLC. Based on 8-core CMP, a LLC structure based on grouped cores is proposed, where 8 cores are divided into 4 groups. All LLC resources are classified into three types, which are fixed private cache, dynamic private cache and dynamic shared cache. The layout of the LLC structure and the corresponding dynamic partitioning strategy are designed to achieve low access latency and high efficiency. Experimental results on full-system simulator suggest that the proposed structure and method are able to reduce the access latency by 2% to 12% compared with previous works, such as tiled structure, cache-centered structure and core-centered structure. Consequently, performance measured by IPC is improved up to 7%. The contribution of this paper is useful for CMP performance, and applies to not only 8-core CMP but also all small-scale CMPs.

The NEMO collaboration proposes to build an underwater neutrino telescope located South-East off the Sicily coast. This paper describes the concepts underlying the communication link design going over the whole data acquisition and transport from the front-end electronics to the module sending data on-shore through a fiber optic link which relies on Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing. An on-shore board, plugged into a PC, extracts and distributes data both to first-level trigger and control systems. Underwater apparatus monitoring and controls are guaranteed by oceanographic instruments and dedicated sensors, whose data are packed and sent back to shore using the same optical link. The communication is fully bidirectional, allowing transmission of timing and control commands. The architecture described here provides a complete real-time data transport layer between the onshore laboratory and the underwater detector. During winter 2006 a first prototype of the apparatus has been deployed: calibration results from the currently working system are here reported.

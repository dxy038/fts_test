This paper applies the semi-structured decision-making model (SDM) to the multi-objective linear programming. Firstly, the general form of the multi-objective programming is introduced. Then the SDM is proposed. After that, the weight of decision-making objective is determined, and also the objective function is established combining with the SDM. Finally, the algorithm is discussed with an example.

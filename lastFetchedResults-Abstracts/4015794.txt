The authors describe the Kontek HVDC cable link connecting Denmark and Germany which has been in commercial operation since 1996, and, with a total length of 172 km and a transmission capacity of 600 MW at 400 kV, the cable link is still unique worldwide. In addition, the 120 km of land cable is the worldÂ´s longest continuous length of underground cable for HVDC application. The objective of this grand project was to enable the export of electric power from efficient Danish power generating stations, combined with an eventual transmission link between Sweden and the eastern part of Germany

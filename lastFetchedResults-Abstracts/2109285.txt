Objective(s):The present study investigated the antidiabetic and hypolipidemic properties of Dorema aucheri leave hydroalcoholic extract in nicotinamide-streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: nicotinamide/streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were supplemented orally with three different doses of D. Â aucheri (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg BW) or glibenclamide (0.25 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Ultimately, blood of animals has taken and glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, leptin levels were assayed. Results: D. aucheri has highly significant blood glucose lowering effect. Administration of the extract to diabetic rats resulted in a remarkable change in serum lipid profiles, insulin and leptin levels relative to diabetic group. Also the extract reversed back the serum levels of SGPT, alkaline phosphatase and SGOT to near normal in treated diabetic rats. Conclusion: D. aucheri could be useful in treatment of diabetes. Moderate dose of D. aucheri (200 mg/kg) was more effective than the others.

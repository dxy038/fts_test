In this article, we present the first approximation algorithm for a routing problem that is frequently encountered in the motion planning of Unmanned Vehicles (UVs). The considered problem is a variant of a Multiple Depot-Terminal Hamiltonian Path Problem and is stated as follows: There is a collection of m UVs equipped with different sensors on-board and there are n targets to be visited by them collectively. There are restrictions on the targets of the following type: (1) A target may be visited by any UV, (2) a target must be visited only by a subset of UVs (with appropriate on-board sensor) and (3) a target may not be visited by a subset of UVs (as the set of on board sensors on the UV may not be suitable for viewing the targets). The UVs are otherwise identical from the viewpoint of dynamic constraints on their motion and hence, the cost of traveling from a target A to a target B is the same for all vehicles. We will assume that triangle inequality is satisfied by the cost associated with travel, i.e., it is cheaper to travel from a target A to a target B directly than to go via an intermediate target C. The UVs may possibly start from different locations (referred to as depots) and are not required to return to the depot. While there are different objectives that can be considered for this problem, we consider the total cost of travel of all the UVs as an objective to be minimized. The problem considered in this article is a generalized version of single depot-terminal Hamiltonian Path Problem and is NP-hard.

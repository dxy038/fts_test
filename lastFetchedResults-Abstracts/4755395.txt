In this paper, we present a new distance and velocity assisted handoff decision algorithm (DVAH). By sampling the received power from base station (BS) continually and with the beforehand downloaded base station coverage radius and some propagation parameters, the mobile terminal (MT) can estimate the distance and the leaving velocity from surrounding BSs. By the assistance of the estimated distance and leaving velocity to all the concerned BSs, MT decides the best objective BS and the best moment to trigger a vertical handoff. The simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance of DVAH compared with the traditional power-based decision algorithms in strict checkout conditions. In addition, this handoff decision algorithm is completely implemented by MT alone, no needing any assistance from BS, and can be adopted by horizontal handoff also.

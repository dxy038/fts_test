Users´ competition in a multicell OFDMA network has been modeled as auction game. A combinatorial auction, which takes into account the interference from adjacent cells is presented. Users´ valuation for a set of subcarriers is sent to the base station, which acts as an auctioneer and makes the decisions on the allocation. Auction objective is to minimize the interference, while power of users is limited. Our proposed valuation function will enforce truth-telling of the users. Due to the complexity of original problem, we apply a heuristic approach, which orders the bids based on the linear programming approximation of combinatorial auction, and then makes local improvements in the order of bids. Our iterative approach along with the proposed load control scheme provides fair distribution of resources to the users, regardless of their position in the cell. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of our proposed method.

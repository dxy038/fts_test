Background and Objective: Trichomonas vaginalis is a pathogenic agent known worldwide and affects about 180 million annually. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis in diabetic patients referred to diabetic research center.
Material and Methods: In this descriptive-analytic study, 215 women referring to the Diabetic Center in Kermanshah Province were investigated for Trichomonas vaginalis. After collecting the data by a questionnaire, the samples were obtained from posterior fornix by sterile swabs and sent for assessing by direct microscopy and Dorset medium.  
Results: Totally, 1.3 percent of the women were confirmed to be infected with T. vaginalis.
Conclusion: The range of blood sugar cannot remarkably affect the prevalence of T. vaginalis.  Given the limitations of this study and low prevalence compared to similar studies, we recommend further comprehensive research for better understanding.

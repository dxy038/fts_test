This paper adapts some literature results on stabilizing discrete time-varying input delay systems to the case of having a predictor-based controller. The objective of the paper is showing that the incorporation of predictors to the referred results is relatively simple and, by means of such predictors, robustness against delay mismatch in the input channel may be improved. In this way, larger delay variation margins are proved with predictors when compared to standard memoryless state feedback, as intuitively expected, due to the extra past information available.

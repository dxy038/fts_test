In this paper we present the idea that by using AI planning in concert with formal task modeling, the overhead associated with plan creation for complex tasks can be reduced. The proposed approach uses a SysML taxonomy to model the system capabilities and the process specification, and the PDDL planning language to determine acceptable objective solutions. This idea is applied to the manufacturing domain, and examples are shown modeling a multi-robot system in an automobile manufacturing environment. A discussion is given regarding the merits of the demonstrated approach.

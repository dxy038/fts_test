In general, reactive power management emphasizes on a single objective, which cannot satisfy the ISOÂ´s expectation of the optimisation on several points simultaneously. Therefore in this paper, a multiple-objective optimal reactive power flow (ORPF) is proposed to minimize both losses and payment for the provision of reactive power service on the framework of the UK balancing market. In the optimisation procedure, a compromise programming is used to solve the multiple objectives. Case study for a 6-bus test system is carried out to illustrate the application of the proposed modelling framework.

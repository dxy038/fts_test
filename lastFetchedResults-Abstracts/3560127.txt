A complete coherent multichannel system, designed for application in the local loop, is presented. The concept of a uni- and bidirectional system and its technical realization in a laboratory demonstrator are described. The network control, including frequency management of the bidirectional channels, and network security are discussed. Attention is paid to the scenario for evolution from a narrowband to a complete broadband system. All aspects are integrated in a demonstrator, which is capable of supporting a large number of narrowband and broadband distributive and communicative services. Novel technical solutions for frequency management, data induced polarization switching (DIPS), high-speed encryption, and network signaling are presented

Reconfigurable antenna implementation can be separated into three main processes: Antenna design, simulation, and optimization. The objective of this paper is to provide insight into the selections that must be made to implement a reconfigurable antenna, serving as a guideline for future reconfigurable antenna designers as to what needs to be done before a model is constructed, such as choosing a suitable antenna structure and reconfiguration technology, a proper simulation environment, and an adequate optimization algorithm that will allow smooth transitions between reconfigurable states. These selections are directly dependent on the given project requirements. Several options are presented for each case, and particular selections are made based on desired characteristics.

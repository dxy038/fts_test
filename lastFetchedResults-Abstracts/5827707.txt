The objective of this paper was to develop a real time hardware image processing system which is based on field programmable gate array (FPGA). The chosen image processing algorithms implemented was edge detection. This work utilizes Altera DE2 development board powered by Cyclone II FGPA pair with 1.3 Mega pixel CMOS camera from Terasic Technologies. Verilog HDL was used as the hardware programming language for a real-time edge detection system. The resulting edge detection images showed that a simple edge detection algorithm was implemented on Cyclone II FPGA for real-time image processing.

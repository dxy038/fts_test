The objective of this study is quantitative evaluation of the sensitivity of overhead line parameters algorithms to the harmonics constituents in the line current and voltage instantaneous values. For this purpose harmonic constituents of different orders are added to current and voltage instantaneous values. Their phase shifts and amplitude values are varied and line parameters are calculated by the developed algorithms. The results are presented in tables and diagrams.

The objective of the EU-Commission for efficient use of energy concerning the growing dependence of the member states from external resources and primary energy carrier and the increasing decentralisation of the federal supply systems especially for electricity on the basis of rising amount of feed in by renewable or decentralized sources requires new concepts for coordination between supply and demand. This paper describes a concept for a market-oriented efficiency optimisation and service platform for electricity systems by using a consistent communication infrastructure to exchange necessary data, the project integral resource optimisation network (IRON). The future needed, higher requirements for communication will be covered by the new infrastructure and the basis for utilisation of the unused, potential and virtual energy storages will be created. Without influencing the behaviour of the user directly and promoted by economic incentives, the energy consumption will be adapted to the existing resources of supply by using the available, virtual energy storages via a market platform. Occurring, expensive spikes of consumption can be reduced, and the partner of the IRON market concept can share the thereby resulting economisation of costs. In this way the market platform leads to a more efficient use and contributes to reliability and stability of the electricity system.

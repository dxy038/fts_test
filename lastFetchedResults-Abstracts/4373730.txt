A class of DEDS that its dynamic performance can be described with serial stream line, under the "process perturbation", attained of its state and tracing of controlled objection, can be implemented by a class of linear state feedback controller in the sense of parameter Dioid. Whether or not the "process perturbation" exists, it can "cancel" either by the substantial buffer capacity unsuitable matching of controlled objective or by the jobs-flow blocking activity of system without buffer, such that system finished rapidly transient process and went into uniform periodicity stable-state operation

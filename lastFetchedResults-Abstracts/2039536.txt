Background & Objective: The present study presents a model of effective factors in the intention to use information technology (IT) in teaching and learning among students of Payame Noor University and Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Iran.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study performed using Krejcie and Morgan ' s (1970) formula and by considering unreturned questionnaires and eliminating incomplete questionnaires. The 120 questionnaires from students of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and 317 questionnaires from Payame Noor University of Fars province were analyzed using path analysis and AMOS software.
Results: The results show that the impact of perceived ease of use on students' intention to use IT is higher in Payame Noor University students (0.338) than Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (0.204). The impact of perceived usefulness on intention to use IT was higher among Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (0.280) than Payame Noor University students (0.218). Moreover, the impact of goal achievement on perceived ease of IT use was higher in Payame Noor University students (0.356) than Shiraz University of Medical Sciences students (0.255). No significant differences were observed between the students of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and Payame Noor University in other paths.

This paper presents an optimal placement of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the radial distribution network. The main objective of this paper is to minimize the total power losses and improve the voltage profile of the system. The Particle Swarm Optimization with Constriction Factor Approach (PSO-CFA) technique has been used for optimal placement of EVs on IEEE-33 radial distribution test system. The 24 hours load data across each node is considered in this paper. The charging and discharging of EVs during 24 hours are also discussed. The impact on power losses and voltage profile with and without EVs are also mentioned in this paper.

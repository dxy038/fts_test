The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of antioxidants to prevent discoloration in pork rib bones. Pork rib bones were removed from carcasses, frozen (−20 °C, 24 h), split lengthwise, exposed to antioxidant solutions (ascorbic acid, citric acid, propyl gallate or ascorbic/EDTA mix), packaged (modified atmosphere [80% O2 and 20% CO2] or air), then displayed in a retail case at 4 °C for 8 days. Dark pigment formation was visually evaluated during the display period. Instrumental color was determined at the end of the 8-day display period. Visual bone discoloration increased over time for all treatments. After 2 days of display, samples treated with propyl gallate were visually redder, less discolored and less green/black than samples treated with other antioxidants. After 8 days of display, propyl gallate-treated samples had higher a* and b* values, as well as chroma (intensity). However, this difference was no longer large enough to be visually detected.

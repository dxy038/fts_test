The oil-field power system and provincial power system belong to the different power system, which purchases the maximal economic benefit respectively. Therefore, under the security restraint, how to cooperate each source output to meet the need of economic operation of the oil-field power system adaptively becomes a very important problem. The mathematical model of oil-field power system output optimization is set up under the market condition, which takes the minimal power cost as the objective function, whose constraints include power supply balance, power station output, line security. At the same time, considering the influence on the actual power price of the net losses generated by the difference of the geographical different sources the modified power price is introduced. Furthermore, the improved genetic algorithm using the chaotic searching method is proposed and applied to the optimization for the oil-field power system. Results show that the improved algorithm can reduce the power costs of the oil-field power system.

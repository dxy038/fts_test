Recognition of the Revelation occasions of the verses of the Holy Qur’?n is highly effective in understanding them. However, sometimes several occasions are mentioned under a verse and the researcher does not know which one to trust. In addition, the fabricated traditions having found their way into the traditions of Revelation occasions and their plunging into the maelstrom of paraphrasing has caused the traditions to be afflicted with being distorted, besides being the narrator’s individual inference rather than the report of an objective unbiased observer. Verses 113 and 114 of S?rat al-Tawba are among the verses, for which the interpreters have mentioned various Revelation occasions. This research seeks to answer the major question as to which one the researcher should trust when encountering these Revelation occasions, since the analytical study of these traditions will definitely help us better understand the purpose of the verses so that we may exploit them more usefully. Thus, by examining the context of the traditions and the ?ad?th and rij?l? resources, the viewpoint of the Sunn? scholars who regard the Revelation occasion to be related to the Prophet’s (S.A.W.) uncle, Ab? T?lib, or his mother, ?mina, is rejected and only the tradition from Imam ‘Al? (A.S.) concerning a person’s istighf?r (asking for God’s pardon) for his parents who had died as polytheists is accepted.

Number of users, now a days tries to access the data in different type of online services like shopping, gaming, learning etc., which tends to increase the computing as well as storing/fetching load if we use single server. Increase of load on a server results in reduction of throughput and it leads to a strong need of developing and maintaining an efficient system with an appropriate load balancing algorithm that will be used to retrieve the important information with a reasonable response time. The main objective of our study is to propose an new approach for load balancing which can balance the incoming requests from global users which reside in different geographical locations to retrieve the information from a distributed data sources using effective scheduling and virtualization techniques. We are utilizing the combination of Batch Mode Heuristic Priority and Round Robin Scheduling for reducing the load on server. This paper provide good results as we compare Batch mode and Online Mode priority, and conclude with suggestion to use Batch Mode in place of Online mode for better load balancing.

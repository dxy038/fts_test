The EMG-force relationships of electrically stimulated muscle under a wide range of firing rate and recruitment control strategies were studied in a predominantly slow (soleus) and fast (m. gas-trocnemius) twitch muscles with the objective of applying the results in rehabilitative systems where the EMG serves as a force feedback parameter.

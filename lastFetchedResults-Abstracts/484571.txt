Background and Objective: Postraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is very common. Various investigations prove the biological basis of PTSD. However, the hemispheric asymmetry has not been studied in these patients. The aim of this study was to find out the probability of hemispheric asymmetry in PTSD patient through EEG. 

Materials & Methods: This is a descriptive-comparative study in which 15 veterans with PTSD from among neurological clinic clients were selected and studied. The artifact free EEG epoch was analyzed by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and Power values of particular frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta) were observed on the Frontal, Central and Occipital Regions. The results were analyzed for Descriptive Statistics and Paired Sample T-Test was performed.

Results: The results of investigation indicated, that PTSD patients have hemispheric asymmetry in delta activity of Frontal, Central and Occipital regions as well as Alpha and Beta asymmetry in occipital region(P<0/001).

Conclusion: It appears that the Alpha and Beta activity in Occipital region and Delta activity in Frontal, Central and Occipital regions are related to PTSD.

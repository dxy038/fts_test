The absorption of a gaseous species by a slurry droplet containing reactive and sparingly soluble microparticles is numerically simulated. The problem studied is relevant to spray flue gas desulfurization systems and the objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of the reactive solid particles on the parameters that determine the mass transfer processes. Spherical droplets with internal circulation similar to Hillâ€™s vortex flow were considered. Quasi-steady conservation equations representing the absorbed and dissolved reactant species and equations representing the dissolution of particles were numerically solved using the droplet internal circulation streamline as a coordinate. Second-order and instantaneous chemical reactions were both addressed. The results show that the reactant microparticles enhance the absorption rate by increasing the gradient of the absorbed species beneath the droplet surface. The relative effect of solid particles depends strongly on the droplet internal circulation and diminishes as stronger recirculation occurs.

Background Assessing and addressing child abuse histories
are one of the grand challenges in psychiatric rehabilitation.
Archival information, e.g., comprehensive psychosocial
evaluations, objective testing, court documents, and medical
chart information can provide useful and objective historical
accounts. It is essential to develop a reliable and valid child
abuse rating system for archival information.
Purpose and methods This study aimed to examine the
reliability and predictive validity of a highly structured and
specific child abuse rating system used to code archival
information for 150 psychiatric inpatients with severe
mental illness (SMI).
Results The child abuse rating system produced reliable
ratings across raters and subtypes of child abuse were
highly inter-related. More than half (56.5%) of the sample
with SMI was identified to have one or more types of child
abuse history; specifically, child sexual abuse (CSA, 36%),
child physical abuse (CPA, 27.3%), emotional maltreatment
(EM, 36%), failure to provide (FTP, 10.7%), and lack
of supervision (LOS, 32%). Female participants (50%)
with SMI had higher rates of CSA than male participants
(20.8%). Subtypes of child abuse history were related to
poorer premorbid functioning, but the relationships varied
across different types of child abuse. In addition, CSA and
EM were related to greater suspiciousness/hostility.
Conclusion The child abuse rating system for archival data
fills an important gap in existing methodology and, in conjunction
with a self-report measure, is expected to improve
the assessment and understanding of the prevalence of child
abuse among adults with SMI. Potential limitations and
recommendations for future research are discussed

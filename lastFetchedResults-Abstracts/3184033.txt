In recent years, fossil fuel serves as major resource for generating electricity. Solar power is pollution free and available at any place on the earth. Wind energy is basically harnessing of wind power to produce electricity. A conventional grid connected hybrid photovoltaic system with windmill system extracts solar and wind power with high boosting capability and galvanic isolation. In conventional system the buck boost converter was used which has the drawback that the input current has some ripples. The inverter used here is single level inverter, which do not eliminate harmonics. The proposed method is a hybrid solar and windmill system which makes use of a DC/DC (SEPIC) converter for each of the two sources, with a common converter stage. ItÂ´s advantageous that input current have fewer ripples. Here multilevel (5-level) inverter is used to make total harmonic reduction. The DC/AC inverter is capable of bidirectional power transfer. The LC filter is used in series with the multilevel inverter for filtering the harmonics. The fuzzy controller is implemented in closed loop with the multilevel inverter for the better results. The simulation results are shown in this paper. Using fuzzy logic controller in closed loop with the multilevel inverter, the harmonics is reduced to low value. A system using a combination of these different sources has the advantage of balance and stability that offers the strengths of each type of sources that complement one another. Hybrid energy system is an excellent solution for electrification of remote rural areas where the grid extension is difficult and not economical.

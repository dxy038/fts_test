Light-emitting diode (LED)-based visible light communication (VLC), combining illumination and communication, is a promising technique for providing high-speed, low-cost indoor wireless services. In indoor environments, multiple LEDs routinely used as lighting sources may also be concomitantly invoked to support wireless services for multiple users, thus forming a multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Since the user terminals detect all the light rays impinging from multiple LEDs, inter-user interference may severely degrade the attainable system performance. Hence, we conceive a transceiver design for indoor VLC MU-MISO systems to suppress the multiuser interference (MUI). In contrast to classic radio-frequency (RF) communication, in VLC, the signals transmitted from the LEDs are restricted by optical constraints, such as the real-valued nonnegativity of the optical signal, the maximum permissible optical intensity, and the constant brightness requirements of the LEDs. Given these practical constraints, we design the optimal transceiver relying on the objective function of minimizing the maximum mean square error (MMSE) between the legitimate transmitted and received signals of the users and show that it can be readily found by solving a convex second-order cone program. Then, we also propose a simplified transceiver design by incorporating zero-forcing (ZF) transmit precoding (TPC) and show that the TPC coefficients can be efficiently found by solving a linear program. The performance of both the optimal and the simplified transceiver is characterized by comprehensive numerical results under diverse practical VLC system setups.

Objective
esence of teratoma in the primary orchiectomy specimen creates controversies for subsequent management. Although predominant teratoma is less likely to metastasize, teratoma in the retroperitoneum may be less amenable to chemotherapy. In order to elucidate the issues about teratoma in the primary tumor, we reviewed differences between primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (P-RPLND) vs. post-chemotherapy RPLND (PC-RPLND) in patients with teratoma at orchiectomy.
als and methods
ts who had undergone RPLND at our institution from 2001 to 2008 were identified, and clinical charts reviewed. Eighty-three patients with teratoma at orchiectomy were identified and perioperative data were obtained.
s
 83 patients with teratoma at orchiectomy who underwent RPLND, 44 (53%) and 39 (47%) underwent primary and PC-RPLND, respectively. Median follow-up was 1.4 years. Of the 83 patients with primary teratoma at orchiectomy, there were 7 (8%) patients with pure teratoma and 76 (92%) patients with mixed histology. Of the patients with mixed histology, 72 (87%) patients had embryonal carcinoma and 36 (43%) had LVI. There were 19 (43%) positive lymph nodes for P-RPLND, of which 13 (30%) contained teratoma. For the PC-RPLND group, 30 (77%) of lymph nodes were positive, of which 28 (72%) contained teratoma. There were 3 (4%) recurrences overall, all of which recurred in the PC-RPLND group. There were 11 (13%) perioperative complications total. There were no deaths in either group.
sions
ts with teratoma at orchiectomy were associated with other high risk features and are at significant risk for metastatic disease. Patients with post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal findings are at significant risk for viable GCT and/or teratoma and should undergo PC-RPLND.

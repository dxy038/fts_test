This keynotes address covers methods employed to design highly reliable microsystems dedicated to build smart medical devices such as sensors and microstimulateurs. Advanced circuit techniques are used to make low-power low-voltage high reliability interfaces dedicated to wirelessly power up and bidirectionnely exchange various types of data with implantable devices. Special attention will be paid to power management, inductive power links, bidirectional data links, recording of ENGs, and remote measurement of electrodes-tissues interfaces. A global view of typical micro-devices will be given and a case study related to intracortical microstimulation to create adequate vision for the blind will be presented.

The objective is to discuss on influences of long-term winter swimming on hemorheology of Males (70-80 years old), which it can provide an experimental basis for scientific fitness of the elders in China by consulting health examination archives of subjects since 1998, and then comparison and analysis of all lipid and hemorheology indexes were made. The whole-blood viscosity at low, medium and high shear of winter swimming group, the reduced viscosity of whole blood is lower than that of control group, viscosity of whole blood is higher than that of control group; There was no significance difference. Two groups of hematocrit means are equal. The plasma viscosity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of winter swimming group was obviously lower than those of the control group, thereÂ´s obvious difference (P &lt;0.01). A long term winter swimming can reduce the blood plasma viscosity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of the male (45-55 year old), improve hemorheology characteristics.

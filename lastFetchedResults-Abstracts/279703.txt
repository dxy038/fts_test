The objective of this article is to present a new method of preoperative localization of nonpalpable breast lesions by means of an adhesive marker plate that makes an anteroposterior approach to the thoracic wall possible. Between January 2000 and September 2002, 41 consecutive mammographic localizations were performed with the adhesive marker plate. In most cases (n=34) the lesions were microcalcifications. The mean age of the patients was 54.7 years. The device used consists of a square plate made of highly flexible plastic with an adhesive film on the back for firm attachment to the area of the breast surface corresponding to the approximate location of the lesion. This plate contains a network of holes and a system of radiopaque coordinates. The technique for its use is described step by step. All 41 lesions were localized: to within 5 mm or by transfixation of the lesion in 95.1% of cases (39/41) and to within 1 cm in the remaining 2 cases. Surgical excision of the breast lesions was carried out successfully in all cases, and in 56% (23/41) it was possible to use a periareolar incision. Histological findings revealed 24 benign and 17 malignant lesions. This new technique permits the localization of nonpalpable breast lesions accurately, simply, and with very little discomfort to the patient. The anteroposterior approach simplifies the surgeon's task in the management of these lesions.

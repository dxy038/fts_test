In this paper, the mover speed control of a linear induction motor considering the end-effects compensation is proposed. Firstly, the indirect field oriented control LIM is derived taking into account the end effects. Then, speed control design with end-effects compensation using rotor-time constant estimation is investigated in order to estimate end-effects variation and to achieve a speed and flux tracking objective under load thrust force disturbance. The numerical simulation results of the proposed scheme have presented good performances as compared to the classical scheme control without end-effects compensation.

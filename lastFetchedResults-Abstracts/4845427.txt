In this work we applied the direct directed transfer function (dDTF) to fMRI simultaneously recorded with EEG. The objective of the current study is to explore the functional brain network formed by the regions involved in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response related to interictal spikes in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Since fMRI response have been often observed in extratemporal regions, we used a dDTF analysis to study the directionality of the interactions. We demonstrated that this data-driven method of effective connectivity is able to uncovering the information flow between the brain areas involved in the generation of spikes in TLE.

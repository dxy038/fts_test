This paper investigates synchronization of coupled chaotic systems by means of modified impulsive controller. The modified impulsive controller is an addition of an integral term of the errors, which is different from the normal impulsive one. Some novel criteria on synchronization of such chaotic systems are derived by utilizing the stability analysis of impulsive differential equations and differential inequalities.

In this paper, a normalized color-ratio model for color filter array (CFA) interpolation schemes is presented. Using the linear scale shift of the input color components the proposed normalized model enforces the underlying modelling assumption in both smooth and high-frequency image regions. Thus, the utilization of the proposed model, which represents a generalization of the conventional color-ratio model, can significantly boost the performance of most well-known CFA interpolators, in terms of both objective and subjective image quality measures.

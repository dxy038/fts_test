This paper considered the complexity of foundation pit and many unforeseen factors during the construction, and the combined effects of polar coordinate measurement errors and control points position errors, and put forward firstly Smart Station polar-coordinate observation method which uses Smart Station to observe horizontal displacement: firstly, measuring the distance and angle of the central points of the reflector by high-precision non-prism Smart Station, to obtain coordinates of the center point exactly; the next step is to make comparison between monitoring data and predictive value, figure out the horizontal displacement of observation points on the spot by the software in the Smart Station, to judge whether the construction parameters and technology are in line with expectations. When the error is over the limit values, the automatic alarm function will be set up, which provides a basis and feasibility for the most rapid design and construction programs to adjust construction scheme and control soil deformation. According to different error sources, choosing three kinds of common methods after integrating subjective and objective aspects, and compared Smart Station polar coordinate method with the traditional polar coordinate and at last demonstrated the superiority of the method of Smart Station polar coordinates. This study made super station used in polar plane displacement monitoring to improve the accuracy of the plane displacement monitoring and speed up the efficiency of the monitoring, at the same time which will make monitoring of plane displacement more reliable.

The goal of this paper is to develop equalizers which can provide soft information to channel decoders for use in the single or the initial stage of iteration, of equalization and decoding architectures, especially for difficult channel to equalize. We propose an equalization structure by combining noncausality, bidirectionality and soft processing, and then we apply the soft noncausal and bidirectional DFE for North American HDTV terrestrial broadcast and EDGE cellular standard to examine its performance.

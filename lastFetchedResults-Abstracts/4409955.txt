In-band multi bidirectional passive optical network (MPON) based on optical code division multiple access technique was implemented. Up/downstream data carried by wavelengths in C-band with channel spacing 25/50GHz and all the data encoded by modified quadratic congruence code (MQC). The MPON network has been implemented to increase the system capacity by using the same code and same prime number. This indicates that, the multi premises are directly proportional with the prime number. Although the receiver sensitivity is affected by the multi premises system, the bit error rate value is still sufficient for good system performance.

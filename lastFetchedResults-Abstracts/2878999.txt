In road networks, the most common metrics to determine the optimal route relaying two points are either the path length or the travel time. However, as autonomous smart cars are expected to emerge in future smart cities and lead to an unprecedented growth of mobile applications spectrum for both drivers and passengers, we argue that other metrics can be also considered for route selection. Therefore, the best route for a driver will be also determined by specific in-vehicle users´ requirements such as, ensuring sufficient quality for wireless connection with minimum cost, and selecting preferred access networks, etc. To this end, we propose an original algorithm that enables route selection based on maximum expected signal quality with respect to the drivers´ maximum tolerated prolongation of journey. Our ultimate objective is to select the route that ensures sufficient signal quality for users on board by maximizing the usage of VANETs resources, through RSUs, while minimizing the usage of the costly LTE-A resources. The obtained simulation results, under several scenarios, have proven the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

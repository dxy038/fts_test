Economic load dispatch is an important problem to be considered in the generation side where the power demand plays the vital role for the economic operation of thermal power plants. The Economic dispatch problem is formulated by a smooth differentiable or piecewise quadratic objective function, which is the same approach used by classical optimization methods. Even though, due to the valve-point effects, the real input output characteristics becomes a higher order nonlinear and discontinuous one which results in a non-convex, non-smooth fuel cost function. Even the most popular PSO technique also presents decade to have a more optimized value in certain applications. Power system is one such application where the naturally inspired algorithms are giving better results than the conventional methods like lambda iteration method , gradient method etc. In this paper, particle swarm optimization which solves economic and practical economic load dispatch problem (with valve point effect) with better optimized results in a little fraction of seconds is explained. In this case, 3 generator system, 13 generator system and 20 generator systems are considered and the optimal values of power of each generator which gives optimal cost was found by this time effective particle swarm intelligence is proposed in this paper.

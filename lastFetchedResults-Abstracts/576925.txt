Introduction & Objective: One of the most and important problems of hemodialysis Patients is electrolytes disorders. Most of patients have not suitable knowledge about their diet's restrictions. Education is a powerful method to help patients for modification of their behaviors and improve their abilities and knowledge for good performance. Small group education is a kind of group education.
Materials & Methods: This is a quasi-experimental study that data were collected from 42 Hemodialysis patients. Before education serum's electrolytes measured. Then small group education performed in 4 sessions. One week and month after education this variables measured again.
Results: The means of serum's sodium before, one week and one month after education was 137.21, 135.81 and 134.95 meq/l respectively; which was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The means of serum's potassium before, one week and one month after education were 5.16, 4.96 and 4.99 meq/l respectively; differences between before education and one week after education was statistically significant(P < 0.05), but differences between before education and one month after education was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The means of serum's calcium before, one week and one month after education were 8.76, 9.25 and 9.58 mg/dl respectively; which was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The means of serum's phosphor before, one week and one month after education was 5.15, 4.45 and 4.60 mg/dl respectively; which was statistically significant (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Small group education is effective to modifying the disorders of serum's potassium, calcium and phosphor in hemodialysis' patients.

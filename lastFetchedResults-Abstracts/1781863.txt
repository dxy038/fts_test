AbstractBackground
iological studies on anthropometric features and cutaneous melanoma risk in women yielded inconsistent results, with few analyses involving prospective cohort data. Our objective was to explore several anthropometric characteristics in relation to the risk of melanoma in women.
s
spectively analysed data from E3N, a French cohort involving 98,995 women born in 1925–1950. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires sent biennially over 1990–2008. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for age, number of naevi, freckling, skin and hair colour, skin sensitivity to sun exposure, residential sun exposure, and physical activity.
s
 was positively associated with melanoma in age-adjusted models only (RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.05–1.55 for ≥164 cm vs. &lt;160 cm; P for trend = 0.02). After full adjustment, there was a significantly positive relationship between sitting-to-standing height ratio and melanoma risk (RR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.06–1.86 for ≥0.533 vs. &lt;0.518; P for trend = 0.02). A large body shape at menarche was inversely associated with the risk of melanoma (RR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.62–0.98; compared with lean). However, weight, body mass index, body surface area, waist or hip circumference, sitting height or leg length were not significantly associated with risk.
sion
results suggest that height, sitting-to-standing height ratio and body shape at menarche may be associated with melanoma risk. Further research is required to confirm these relationships and better understand the underlying mechanisms.

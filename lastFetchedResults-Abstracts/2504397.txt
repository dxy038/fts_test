Background: Infertility is defined as one year unprotected intercourse without
pregnancy. It greatly affects couples' quality of life, and has great impact on their
careers, everyday activities, sexual and non-sexual relationships.
Objective: To study the prevalence of both primary and secondary infertility and
demographic characteristics of it in Yazd province.
Materials and Methods: We studied 5200 married defined couples in 260 randomized
clusters. These couples were interviewed based on using a structured questionnaire.
Then, for etiological evaluation, infertile couples were referred to the Research and
Clinical Center for Infertility.
Results: Among these couples, 277 cases of infertility were encountered and the overall
prevalence of infertility was 5.52% (95% CI from 4.9% to 6.1%). In total 170 couples
(3.48%) had primary and 107 (2.04%) had secondary infertility. The prevalence of
infertility in rural and urban areas was 5.3% and 6.8% respectively. Female factors were
more common (57.5%) in etiologic assessment of infertility.
Conclusion: Our data showed a lower total prevalence of infertility in our people
compared to the other countries. Furthermore, there was significant difference in
infertility prevalence between geographic parts of the province. Female factors and
among them ovarian disorders were the main cause of infertility in central part of Iran.

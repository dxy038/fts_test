Diversity of a classifier ensemble has been shown to benefit overall classification performance. But most conventional methods of training ensembles offer no control on the extent of diversity and are meta-learners. We present a method for creating an ensemble of diverse maximum entropy (&#8706;MaxEnt) models, which are popular in speech and language processing. We modify the objective function for conventional training of a MaxEnt model such that its output posterior distribution is diverse with respect to a reference model. Two diversity scores are explored - KL divergence and posterior cross-correlation. Experiments on the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition task and the IEMOCAP emotion recognition database show the benefits of a &#8706;MaxEnt ensemble.

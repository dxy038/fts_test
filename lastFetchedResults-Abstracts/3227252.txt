The worldÂ´s energy requirement has been dominated by petroleum oil for centuries in many areas, including transportation, household, and electricity. Mineral oil application in power system equipment can be potentially hazardous to the environment especially when there are any incidents during operational time like transformer explosion which may cause a spill of oil to the soil or water stream. The first objective of our project deals with best practices of regeneration of the mineral oil used in transformers which is environment friendly and cost effective. In this document, we propose activated carbon obtained from agricultural waste used as the absorbent of impurities in used transformer oil. Critical characteristics such as breakdown voltage (BDV), viscosity, flash point, fire point are measured. The characteristics are enhanced by the regeneration process. The second objective of our project is to use different bio fuels depending on the diversity of the land forms. Soya bean and Corn are being profusely grown in the southern states of India would provide sufficient raw material for coolant in transformer. Critical characteristics of transformer oil will be examined by adding antioxidant with oil obtained from soya bean and corn.

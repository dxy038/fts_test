Two omni directional antennas were used to receive the DTV signals. Antennas were mounted on an X-Y table, which was programmed to move along the X-Y directions with the required spacing. This table is interfaced to the diversity kit using a lab-view program. Three experiments were designed in different indoor environments. All these experiments were carried out along the direction radial to the transmitter. The main objective of the experimental campaign is to find out the minimum spacing required for the diversity antenna separation to achieve maximum diversity gain. Data was analyzed for different spacings to evaluate the diversity gain. It was observed that on the 6th floor, which has line-of-sight with the transmitter, the diversity gain varies as a function of odd multiples of &#955;/2 {(2n+1)&#955;/2} within 2&#955;. On the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor, for an obstructed path, within 2&#955; antenna separation the maximum gain was observed to vary as a function of even multiples of &#955;.

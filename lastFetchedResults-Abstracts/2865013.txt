In this paper, we investigate the subcarrier grouping based resource allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access cognitive radio networks. The objective is to maximize the secondary userÂ´s minimal transmission rate, while taking into account the subcarrier grouping constraint, subcarrier allocation constraint, power allocation constraint, and the interference power constraint. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. It can be solved by the exhaustive searching method, which has an exponential complexity. In order to decrease the computation complexity, a suboptimal fast algorithm will be developed. The suboptimal algorithm solves the subcarrier allocation and power allocation separately. By exploiting the structure of the problem, a fast power allocation algorithm based on the barrier method is proposed. Simulations have been done to verity the performance of the proposed algorithm.

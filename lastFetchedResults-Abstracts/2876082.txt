Independent mobility (freedom to explore the environment without any accompaniment) reduces the dependence on caregivers. Disable people always find themselves challenging to go out independently because of their physical deficiency or inability to move in a normal fashion. A wheelchair is a mechanical device which improves the lifestyle and increase the mobility of disable people, allowing them to explore their surroundings. In this paper, we propose a new technique to control the powered/motorized wheelchair using Infrared Radiation (IR). An attempt has been provided to transmit low intensity infrared rays on eyes. The analog voltage level varies in infrared receiver based on eye lid movement. These techniques grant the user to navigate automatically to desired goal point with the possibility of avoiding collisions and holes in all directions, so that the user can robustly interact with the wheelchair. Main aim of this project is to reduce the human efforts in driving a wheelchair. The user with any extent of disability can operate the wheelchair to attain self-independence at least in daily life activities. The objective of this paper is to provide our services to the disable society by increasing their range of mobility.

This work describes an ongoing project, aiming at the development of a complete simulation study of the Brazilian Data Collecting System based on Satellites (SBCD). The SBCD system comprehends a spatial and a ground segment and it was built for automatic acquisition of data of meteorological and hydrological nature for use in environmental and business applications. The main objective of the project is to build a simulator for conducting a thorough analysis of the system, in order to assess its performance, to determine its best configuration and boundary conditions, and to optimize its operational cost and efficiency, in regard to different configurations and operating scenarios.

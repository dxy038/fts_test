The objective of this paper is to present a mixed test structure designed to characterize yield losses due to hard defect and back-end process variation (PV) at die and wafer level. A brief overview of the structure, designed in a ST-Microelectronics´ 130 nm technology, is given. This structure is based on a SRAM memory array for detecting hard defects. Moreover each memory cell can be configured in the ring oscillator (RO) mode for back-end PV´s characterization. The structure is tested in both modes (SRAM, RO) using a single test flow. Experimental results are given and confirm the ability of the structure to monitor PV and defect density.

In the processing of information aggregation, some data can only be expressed with linguistic value in a qualitatively way in that the objective things have their fuzziness and people have vague knowledge about the objective things. Aggregation operators are very important to the people when they process the linguistic value. The Ordered Weighted Aggregation (OWA) operator is the most common operator to aggregate the arguments that are the exact numerical values. However, the OWA operator has disadvantages of overlooking the importance of given argument itself and aggregating linguistic values directly. Inspired by OWA operators, scholars at home and abroad proposed some linguistic aggregation operator. The aim of this paper is to develop a new methodology for solving multiple attribute decision making problems in which the decision information is the fuzzy linguistic value. The methodology is based on the EWOA and LHA operators, and is straightforward without loss of information. At last, an illustrative example is given to prove the methodology is rationality&#8229;

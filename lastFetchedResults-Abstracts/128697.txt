Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common among patients undergoing hemodialysis, and chronic liver disease is an important cause of mortality in this population. Objective: This study was conducted in 2000 to investigate the prevalence of HCV infection and associated risk factors among patients on hemodialysis in Qazvin.
Methods: In this case series study 68 patients on hemodialysis in Qazvin were selected randomly and all were checked for anti-HCV antibodies, using ELISA 2' d and confirmed using RIBA 2"d
Findings: 16 patients (23.9 %) were infected. Patients' sex, educational level, history of upper GI endoscopy and previous renal transplantation had no impact on HCV infection rate, but blood transfusion was an important risk factor for HCV infection (P=0.02). The more units transfused, the greater rate of HCV infection was reported (P=0.003). Moreover,the mean time of hemodialysis was significantly longer in HCV Ab positive cases (P=0.007).
Conclusion: It seems that early transplantation and avoidance of blood transfusion as much as possible- for example by using erithropoietin- are the two most important practical interventions to reduce HCV exposure rate in patients on hemodialysis.

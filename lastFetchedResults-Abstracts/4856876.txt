This paper introduces a new computer recognition algorithm for image texture recognition. Using this algorithm, the texture characteristic of image is extracted exactly for analysis. 2-d bidirectional median filtering is proposed to make image de-noising an ideal state. An image correction algorithm with Hough transfer on local computation is presented to obtain an image with better position state. An approach based on local extreme value is proposed to search for feature points of image texture to further recognize each parameter of image texture. At last, this paper takes example for fabric density recognition, and gives the result and discusses detail process. The result shows that this approach is correct and efficient, and has extensive application.

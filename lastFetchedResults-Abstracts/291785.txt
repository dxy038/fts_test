A systematic approach to the determination of disability in persons with chronic widespread pain is based on a careful history, examination for tender points, and special investigations to establish a firm diagnosis. Further assessment requires determination of subjective and objective measures of impairment. The causes of fibromyalgia are multifactorial and understanding them requires an appreciation of the role of physical or psychological trauma, and associated medical and psychosocial factors. Despite the presence of disability risk factors, most patients with fibromyalgia maintain a good range of normal daily activities and continue working.

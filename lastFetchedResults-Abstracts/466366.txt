Objective: Our purpose was to examine the efficacy of a topical long-term treatment with boric acid versus an oral long-term treatment (itraconazole) in the cure and prevention of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. Study Design: A prospective, nonrandomized study of patients affected by recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis was undertaken. In 3 years we recruited 22 consecutive patients who underwent therapy with itraconazole (group 1) or boric acid (group 2). Women were followed up for 1 year, with clinic and microbiologic controls after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the first visit. Results: During the treatment, the positive culture results (15.1% vs 12.1%) and the signs and symptoms (33.3% vs 24.2%) were similar within the 2 groups, with no significant statistical difference. With the withdrawal, after 6 months relapses were common in the 2 groups (54.5%). Conclusions: Boric acid seems to be a valid and promising therapy both in the cure of the vaginal infection and in the prevention of relapses of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, but its efficacy ends with the suspension of the therapy.

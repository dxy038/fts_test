This paper deals with the design problem of reliable H<sub>&#8734;</sub> switching fuzzy controllers for continuous-time nonlinear systems with different actuator fault mode. The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to represent a nonlinear system. A class of faulty switched system is constructed to model various faulty nonlinear systems. The objective is to design a state-feedback switching controller such that the switched system is asymptotically stable with H<sub>&#8734;</sub> disturbance attenuation for arbitrary switching laws. Based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, switching Lyapunov function method is adopted to establish sufficient conditions of existence and design method of reliable H<sub>&#8734;</sub> switching fuzzy controller, which reduces the conservatism of the design. Finally, the validity and applicability of the proposed approaches are demonstrated by examples.

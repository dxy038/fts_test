In recent years, a number of countries have introduced plans for national electronic patient record (EPR) systems. It´s been argued that EPR-based applications, that allow healthcare stakeholders remote access to patients´ medical information, will constitute a significant portion of networks traffic loads in the near future. Therefore, the main objective of this present research is to improve the information technology (IT) effectiveness and productivity in the healthcare sector, by measuring actual end-user needs, and managing their applications, systems, and networks.

Objective Based on the National Epidemiological Survey
of Psychiatric Disorders in South Korea conducted in 2006,
we examined the prevalence, clinical correlations, comorbidities,
and suicidal tendencies of pathological gamblers
in the community.
Method Of the 6,510 participants who completed the
Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (K-CIDI) administered by trained lay interviewers,
5,333 subjects fully completed the Diagnostic
Interview Schedule (DIS) exploring pathological gambling.
The DIS has 13 items mapping to 10 criteria. Endorsement
of five DSM-IV criteria was considered to reflect pathological
gambling, and we considered endorsement of one to
four criteria to indicate problem gambling. The frequencies
of psychiatric disorders and suicidal tendency were analyzed
among pathological/problem gamblers in comparison
with controls; both odds ratios and significance levels were
calculated.
Results The lifetime prevalence rates of pathological
gambling and problem gambling were 0.8% and 3.0%,
respectively. Of pathological gamblers, 79.1% had at
least one psychiatric illness in comparison to the control
level of 28.1%, and 62.0% of problem gamblers also
had psychiatric conditions. Associations between pathological/
problem gambling and alcohol use disorder, nicotine
dependence, mood disorder, anxiety disorder,
and suicidality were overwhelmingly positive and significant
(p\0.05), even after controlling for age and
gender. Male gender, divorced/separated/widowed marital
status, and urban living were all associated with
increased risks of pathological and problem gambling
(p\0.05).
Conclusion Pathological/problem gambling is highly
associated with substance abuse, mood and anxiety disorders,
and suicidality, suggesting that clinicians should
carefully evaluate and treat such psychiatric disorders in
gamblers.

Reducing the amount of lost and damaged perishable goods (food and medicines) during transportation and storage represents a substantial global challenge, which imply the implementation of cold chain monitoring at all levels of the supply chains. The main objective of this work is to develop an IoT enabled infrastructure, which supports the development of smart transportation specific applications. The proposed infrastructure contains an emulator, which can be used for emulating the conditions inside a truck during the transportation process and some CEP based tools for processing the data generated by the sensors.

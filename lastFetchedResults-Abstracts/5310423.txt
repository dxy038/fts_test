In this paper we propose a model to represent and manage affective/emotional feedback. This model represents a set of emotions which is assumed to play a major role for learning processes. The emotions are to be identified during the learning phase. To achieve these objectives, we have considered primarily: i) Methods and techniques to assess and identify affectivity/emotivity in ITS (Intelligent Tutoring System), ii) Feedback management derived by the detection ofuser´s affective states in ITS. Our objective is to establish a methodology through the steps that lead us to ´identification and quantification of the emotional state of a learner.

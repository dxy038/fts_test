Due to its wide application in many industries, discrete optimization via simulation (DOvS) has recently attracted more research interests. As industry systems become more complex, advanced search algorithms for DOvS are desired with higher expectation towards efficiency. In this research work, we combine the ideas of single-objective Convergent Optimization via Most-Promising-Area Stochastic Search (COMPASS) with the concept of Pareto optimality to propose multi-objective (MO) MO-COMPASS for solving DOvS problems with two or more objectives. Numerical experiments are illustrated to show its ability to achieve high efficiency.

This paper describes the novel design and optimization of an axial flux motor for blood pump application. With the design objective of maximizing the motor efficiency, different topologies of AFPM machine has been examined. Halbach arrangement of rotor magnets and use of Soft Magnetic Composite (SMC) material for the stator core adds further advantages to the optimal motor design. The results of the 3D Finite element analysis for the novel motor have been shown.

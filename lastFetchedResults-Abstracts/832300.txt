The shape of an acoustic horn is optimized with respect to its ability to provide impedance matching to the surrounding air. The resulting minimization problem is solved using a BFGS quasi-Newton algorithm. The wave propagation is modeled by a finite-element approximation of the Helmholtz equation, and the necessary objective-function gradient is calculated from the solution of the associated adjoint equation. Local solutions to the optimization problem, corresponding to irregular horn contours, are avoided by using a filtering technique that applies smoothing to the design updates and the gradient. The method converges fast to a smooth solution, and the resulting horn has good impedance properties throughout the entire frequency band of interest.

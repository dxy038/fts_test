Background and Objective: Temporary restorations should be able to seal the access cavity and prevent bacterial leakage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the amount of dye penetration through temporary restorations, namely Zonalin, Zamharir, IRM and Coltosol, into the root canal.
Subjects and Methods: In this experimental study, 120 sound human premolar teeth were selected. After access cavity preparation, cleaning and shaping were accomplished using step-back technique and obturated by lateral condensation technique using gutta-percha and AH-26 sealer. 
The teeth were divided into six groups (n=20). In the first to fourth group, the crown was restored with zonalin, zamharir, IRM and coltozol. Group five and six were considered as positive and negative control. 
After keeping these teeth in 37Â°C and 100% humidity for 48 hours, samples were immersed in 10% Indian ink for 72 hours. After sectioning the crowns longitudinally the amounts of dye penetration in the two halves of teeth were assessed using stereomicroscope (xlO). Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA test.
Results: Zonalin had minimum and Coltosol had maximum amount of dye penetration. There were not any significant differences between the Zonalin-Zamharir groups and between the IRM- Coltosol groups (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: Regarding different materials with ZOE base used in this study to treat tooth root, zonal in is the best as a temporary restorative material. However more comprehensive studies need to be performed about Zamharir.

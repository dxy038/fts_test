A new series of antituberculosis agents 6â€“9 was designed, synthesized and evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and clinical isolates in an agar dilution method. Compound 9h showed comparable in vitro activity (MIC) to isoniazid against M. tuberculosis H37Rv and clinical isolates (sensitive strains) and superior activity against resistant strains of M. tuberculosis.

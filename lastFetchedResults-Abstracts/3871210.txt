The main objective of predictive reliability analysis is to quantify, predict and compare reliability indexes for various reliability improvement initiatives. This information helps engineers and managers at electric utility organizations decide how to spend reliability improvement dollars by identifying the most effective actions for improving reliability of distribution feeders. There are many types of system design and maintenance tasks that fall under the reliability improvement umbrella. The type of distribution reliability improvement software discussed here focuses on improvement initiatives that are both practical and economical to implement. Results can be implemented without altering the fundamental system design or philosophies currently in place. In other words, these are not radical departures from the current mode of business, but rather a fine-tuning of systems already in place to achieve a higher level of reliability

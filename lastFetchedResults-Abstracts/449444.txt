Objective
To report a cae of Langerhan cell hitiocytoi preenting a periorbital celluliti.
Deign
Interventional cae report.
Method
A 3-year-old girl preented with periorbital welling of the right upper lid laterally of two dayâ€™ duration. A hitory of recent eye trauma wa reported.
Reult
Computed tomography howed a oft tiue ma that eroded the frontozygomatic uture. The leion wa debulked through a lateral orbitotomy. Electron microcopy dicloed Birbeck granule. Immunohitochemitry tained poitively for CD68 and CD1a antigenic determinant.
Concluion
Although rare, Langerhan cell hitiocytoi can caue acute periorbital celluliti in children. Trauma can induce an inflammatory repone, allowing for earlier diagnoi of the orbital leion.

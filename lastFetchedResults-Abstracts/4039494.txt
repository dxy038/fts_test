The bonding of electrical equipment plays a crucial role in maintaining the same potential between conductive parts likely to be energized and conductive parts liable to introduce a &#8220;zero&#8221; potential into the premises. Voltage rises between such parts are unsafe, as they may induce harmful currents through the human body, the magnitude of which may vary depending on a number of factors. This paper seeks to clarify the bonding requirements in low-voltage electrical systems, by using the concepts of exposed conductive parts and extraneous conductive parts, present in the International Electrotechnical Commission standards, applied to a proposed electric shock model of the human being. With the purpose of reducing the consequences of electric contacts, the authors propose objective criteria to decide whether conductive &#8220;dead&#8221; objects and enclosures of electrical equipment must be bonded or not.

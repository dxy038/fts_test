In this paper, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is implemented to unveil trade-off margins of the CMOS two-stage op-amp. Power, area, slew rate, unity gain frequency (UGF) were used as objectives. Width and length of the gate of MOSFETs are free parameters. Simulation results reveal the design trade-off margins of the two-stage op-amp as expected theoretically.

Introduction & Objective: According to some study, wnt signaling pathway is among those
molecular pathways that involve in cellular proliferation and bone differentiation. On the
other hand, investigations have indicated that 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxim (BIO) is able to
activate this pathway. In the present study, effect of BIO on in vitro proliferation and bone
differentiation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) was considered.
Materials & Metbods: In this experimental study, rat marrow-derived MSCs was used. Initially,
a range of BIO concentration was examined in terms of their effect on MSC viability using
MTT assay. The concentrations with no toxic effect on cell viability including 0.01, 0.1, I and
1.5 flM were then selected and added into either MSC proliferation or bone differentiation
culture medium. To determine the BIO effect on MSC proliferation, population doubling
number (PDN) was calculated and to quantify the BIO effect on MSC bone differentiation,
expression level of the bone specific genes and the amount of culture mineralization was
measured. In these experiments, culture without BIO was considered as control.
Results: PDN results indicated that the cell population at cultures with 0.1 and 1 flM BIO was
doubled in number significantly more than the other cultures (P<0.05). Differentiation
experiment indicated the negative effect of BIO on MSC bone differentiation. At all BI0treated
cultures, the expression level of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase genes as well as
the amount of culture mineralization appeared to be significantly lower than those in control
cultures (P<0.05).
Conclusion: It seems that BI0 enhances MSC proliferation in culture while inhibits the in vitro
bone differentiation.

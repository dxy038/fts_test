In this paper we propose a solution that improves the synchronization and effectiveness of sending and receiving of goods and merchandise by transport companies. We use a service-oriented architecture for the exchange of information related to the reception of products, such as the predicted time when the delivery should take place or the delay in the arrival. Our solution is based on fleet management systems widely used in the transport companies. The main objective of this paper is to improve the interoperability between providers and consumers, thereby creating a communication environment versed in delivery plans. Another feature revised here is the analysis of vehicle tracking information to obtain accurate knowledge of the movement pattern followed by drivers and usefulness for the companies.

Educational climate is a representative of curriculum, dominant spirit on schools, and educational programs. Learning environment is a determining factor and is an indication of students' perception of their embedded learning circumstance. This study aimed to investigate the views of the students about their learning environment based on DREEM model.
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive analytical study was conducted in 2011 on 148 medical and paramedical students using cluster sampling method. Data was gathered by DREEM questionnaire consisting of learning, teachers, and studentsâ€™ perception of academic ability, educational climate, and social environment domains. The questionnaire total score was categorized in five groups; undesirable (0-50), semi desirable (51-100), somewhat desirable (101-150), good (151-200), and very good (201-250). Data was analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics with p < 0.05.
Results: 3.4 percent of the students perceived educational climate as very satisfactory, 67.6 percent as favorable, 28.4 percent somewhat favorable, and 0.7 percent as low. There was a significant relationship between gender and educational climate(p < 0.05).

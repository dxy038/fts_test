Given the importance of children’s development and the role of psychological status of mothers in this regard, this study investigated the relationship of mothers’ psychological status (stress, anxiety and depression) with the development of children aged 36-60 months.

Materials & Methods

This descriptive study was performed on 1036 mothers and their children, aged 36 to 60 months, in different kindergartens in Tehran City, Iran, in 2014-2015.

Participants were selected through multi-stage random sampling. The following instruments were used in this study: A demographic and obstetric specification questionnaire, children specification questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, Spiel Berger Test, Perceived stress questionnaire and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire to determine the status of the children’s development.

Data were analyzed using SPSS20 software, Mann-Whitney; independent t-test and logistic-Regression model were used.

Results

The prevalence of developmental delay in children aged 36-60 months was 16.2%. The independent t-test showed a relationship between maternal stress and developmental delay in children. The Mann-Whitney test revealed a significant relation between mothers’ depression level and developmental delay in their children. There was a significant relation between trait anxiety and developmental delay in children. Moreover, a significant relation was found between maternal stress and developmental delay in fine motor skills.

The logistic regression model showed a significant relationship of child gender, economic and social states with developmental delay.

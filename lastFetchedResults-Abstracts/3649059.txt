Overhead distribution systems used in oil pumping and secondary recovery installations present a challenge to the engineer in obtaining protective device coordination between sectionalizing fuses, line reclosers, and feeder breakers. Ways of obtaining solutions to these problems, especially as related to upgrading existing substation and feeder line protection on medium voltage systems, are proposed. It is noted that a coordination analysis of an oil-patch distribution system involves application of engineering principles, manufacturing data, standards and/or codes, and knowledge of production practices. The objective of the analysis always is to see what can be done to protect equipment, maximize production (minimize outages and downtime), and maintain ease of operation, all at a minimum overall cost. The authors recommend that a PCIC/IEEE working group be formed for the purpose of reviewing oil patch distribution systems specific requirements. The ultimate objective would be to develop appropriate electrical standards and recommended practices for the production industry

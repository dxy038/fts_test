Logistic model is one of the classic models for predicting the number of literatures in a special field. This paper studies the logistic model that is used to describe literatures´ increasing trend, analyzes the shortcoming of improvement algorithms of logistic model at present, and proposes a new algorithm, named DGA-logistic algorithm that is based on multiple objective genetic algorithm. For validating the new algorithm, this paper chooses Chinese digital library´s literatures, which are published in recent years, as dataset. The numerical experiment showed that DGA-logistic has better forecasting result than improvement algorithms of logistic model at present.

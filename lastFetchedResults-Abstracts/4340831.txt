Off-line point to point navigation to calculate feasible paths and optimize them for different objectives is computationally difficult. Path planning problem is truly a multi-objective problem, as reaching the goal point in short time is desirable for an autonomous vehicle while ability to generate safe paths in crucial for vehicle viability. Path representation methodologies using piecewise polynomial and B-splines have been used to ensure smooth paths. Multi-objective path planning studies using NSGA-II algorithm to optimize path length and safety measures computed using one of the three metrics (i) an artificial potential field, (ii) extent of obstacle hindrance and (iii) a measure of visibility are implemented. Multiple tradeoff solutions are obtained on complex scenarios. The results indicate the usefulness of treating path planning as a multi-objective problem.

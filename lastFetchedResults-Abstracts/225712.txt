This paper presents a new genetic algorithm
(GA)–based approach for the simultaneous power quality
improvement and optimal placement and sizing of fixed capacitor
banks in radial distribution networks in the presence of voltage
and current harmonics. The objective function includes the cost
of power losses, energy losses and that of the capacitor banks.
Constraints include voltage limits, number/size and locations of
installed capacitors (at each bus and the entire feeder) and the
power quality limits of standard IEEE-519. Candidate buses for
capacitor placement are selected based on an initial generation of
chromosomes. Using a proposed fitness function, a suitable combination
of objective and constraints is defined as a criterion to
select (among the candidates) the most suitable buses for capacitor
placement. A genetic algorithm computes improved generations of
chromosomes and candidate buses until the solution is obtained.
Simulation results for two IEEE distorted networks are presented
and solutions of the genetic algorithm are compared with those
of the maximum-sensitivities-selection (MSS), the maximum
sensitivities selection-local variations (MSS-LV), and the fuzzy set
algorithms. The main contribution of this paper is the computation
of the near global solution, with weak dependency on initial
conditions.

Reactive power optimization is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem where metaheuristics techniques have proven suitable for providing optimal solutions. Optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) is a key instrument to achieve secure and economic operation of power systems. Due to complex characteristics of ORPD, heuristic optimization has become an effective solver. In this paper, swarm and evolutionary algorithm have been applied for reactive power optimization. A two-phase hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used to solve optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) problem has been presented in this paper. In this hybrid approach, PSO is used to explore the optimal region and direct search is used as local optimization technique for finer convergence. This paper also presents a particle swarm optimization for reactive power and voltage control considering voltage stability. The proposed method determines a control strategy with continuous and discrete control variables such as AVR operating values, OLTC tap positions, and the amount of reactive power compensation equipment. A novel heuristic optimization algorithm namely the Mean-Variance Mapping Optimization (MVMO) is proposed to handle the ORPD problem. The objective of the proposed PSO is to minimize the total support cost from generators and reactive compensators. It is achieved by maintaining the whole system power loss as minimum thereby reducing cost allocation.

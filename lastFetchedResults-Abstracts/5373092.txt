In multi-objective optimization not only fast convergence is important, but it is also necessary to keep enough diversity so that the whole Pareto-optimal front can be found. In this work four variants of differential evolution are examined that differ in the selection scheme and in the assignment of crowding distance. The assumption is checked that the variants differ in convergence speed and amount of diversity. The performance is shown for 1000 consecutive generations, so that different behavior over time can be detected

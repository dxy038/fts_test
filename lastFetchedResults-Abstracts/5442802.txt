Handling many-objective problems is one of the primary concerns to EMO researchers. In this paper, we discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential EMO algorithm for many-objective optimization problems. Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point based many-objective NSGA-II (or MO-NSGA-II) that emphasizes population members which are non-dominated yet close to a set of well-distributed reference points. The proposed MO-NSGA-II is applied to a number of many-objective test problems having three to 10 objectives (constrained and unconstrained) and compared with a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D). The results reveal difficulties of MOEA/D in solving large-sized and differently-scaled problems, whereas MO-NSGA-II is reported to show a desirable performance on all test-problems used in this study. Further investigations are needed to test MO-NSGA-IIÂ´s full potential.

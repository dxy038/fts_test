This paper outlines the clinical considerations for the transition to expand our glutamate sensor technology for human application. This work will lay the groundwork for the application of neurochemical sensor technology for intraoperative decision-making as well as for long term monitoring of stimulating devices and pathological processes. More specifically, we will focus on the application and validation of our glutamate sensor technology within the clinical setting of the operating room. We wish to establish a standard of clinical protocol for the detection and quantitative measurement of glutamate in the human brain. As this technology has not yet been applied to human use, our primary objective is to ensure patient safety and to develop standardized protocols for the routine, real-time monitoring of neurotransmitters. To accomplish this goal we have designed a set of experiments that will progressively evaluate the performance of our neurochemical sensors through the transition into clinical use.

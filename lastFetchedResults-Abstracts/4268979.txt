Network coding considers as a major ability to achieve higher throughput. Toward that goal, this article investigates and analyzes soft decision scheme of network coding (SDS-NC) at relay node to exchange encoding BPSK packets between two nodes with help of the relay over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel by considering the maximum-likelihood (ML) detection metric at the relay. We also consider the Soft Bit Forward (SBF) in order to a sure that the soft schemes perform well. The objective of soft scheme is to achieve better normalized throughput with reliability of information transmission and to solve the complexity. The numerical results of a Soft scheme show that the results obtained are reasonable.

Background and Objective: Evaluation of the importance and the effects of plant derived drugs on fertility
of laboratory animals have long been recognized. In this research the effects of administration of aqueous
extract of Boswellia thurifera on fertility indices, body weight and reproductive organs weight was evaluated
in male rats.
Materials and Methods: Eighteen rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, control, group A and group B.
Each group comprises of six rats. Animals in control group received I ml of distilled water (vehicle) and
test groups (A and B) received graded doses of 200 and 400 mglkg body weight of aqueous extract of
Boswellia thurifera respectively on daily basis for 60 days. At the end of 60 days of treatment period,
fertility indices such as body weight, reproductive organs weight, sperm motility and count, fertility rate,
epididymal sperm reserve (ESR), daily sperm production (DSP) and blood testosterone concentration were
measured.
Results: There was a significant increase in the reproductive organs and body weight, sperm motility and
count, ESR, DSP, blood testosterone concentration and fertility rate especially in the group which received
the higher doses ofaqueous extract of Boswellia thurifera.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that aqueous extract of Boswellia thurifera could increase
fertility rate in male rats.

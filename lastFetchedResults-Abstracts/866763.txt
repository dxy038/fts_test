It is discussed how to route transfer crane during loading operation of export containers in port container terminal. We determine the number of containers which transfer crane picks up at each yard-bay as well as the sequence of yard-bays which transfer crane visits during the tour. The objective is to minimize the total container handling time of the transfer crane including the set-up time at each yard-bay and the travel time between consecutive yard-bays. This routing problem is formulated as an integer programming. An efficient optimizing algorithm is also developed for the crane routing problem.

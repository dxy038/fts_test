In this paper, a new bilevel model with multiple decision-makers is proposed for a project scheduling problem (PSP) which considers the interests of both the project owner and contractor. In this model, the project owner is considered to be the leader and the contractor, the follower. The project owner has two objectives: 1) to maximize profit and 2) minimize makespan, while the contractor&#8217;s objective is to minimize cost only. A fuzzy random simulation-based bilevel global-local-neighbor particle swarm optimization technique is proposed to solve the multiple decision-maker PSP (MDPSP). A case study based on the Wanjiakouzi Hydropower Station is used to demonstrate an application of the developed model and illustrate the scope of the MDPSP.

Due to the focus on clean and green environment, the interest on electrification of existing transportation system is increasing. In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), the "idle-stop" and hence fuel economy is achieved by using integrated starter generator (ISG). This paper discusses the comparative evaluation of active bidirectional converter based ISG and passive quasi-Z source inverter (qZSI) based ISG. The comparison is based on the principle of operation, ease of control, device stress and the efficiency. Simulation based on MATLAB/SIMULINK platform is carried out. The simulation results of induction motor based ISG driven by bi-directional converter and qZSI are presented.

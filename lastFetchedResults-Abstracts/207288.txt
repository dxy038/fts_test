Background: The need for a rapid, noninvasive method for unwanted hair removal has led to the development of various light sources for this purpose.
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of Intense Pulsed Light Source (IPLS) on unwanted hairs.
Patients & Methods: In this open, uncontrolled clinical trial, 77 different anatomical areas in 34 referred patients to "Novin Didegan Clinic" in Tehran in 1380-1381, were treated by IPLS at fluences ranging from 22 to 34 j/cm2 after their demographic data and the number of hairs were recorded. The 3 to 7 treatment sessions were accomplished 4 to 6 weeks apart. All of the patients were followed 6 months after the last therapy. The quantitative data were
analyzed by paired t test.
Results: Six months after the last therapy, more than 50% reduction in number of hairs were noted in 80% of the treated areas; with mean reduction of 72Â±23 percent. Side effects were mild and reversible and occured in ten patients.
Conclusion: The IPLS appears to provide an effective and safe method for long term excess hair removal in various skin types.

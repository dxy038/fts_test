Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology has caught peopleÂ´s attention. Applications of V2G in general Power Grid face some challenges. It is complicated to control, in need of large amounts of EVs and hard to realize in the short term. In this paper V2G is applied to micro-grid and V2G system is constructed based on a parking lot. The structure is proposed in which bidirectional AC/DC and bidirectional DC/DC converters share one common DC bus, and also the coordination control strategy is given. Meanwhile this paper presents a general micro-source model as well as a V2G model. Simulation of voltage regulation and renewable energy support is conducted and results prove the availability of proposed structure and control strategy. The work is meaningful to the control and operation for micro-grid and V2G.

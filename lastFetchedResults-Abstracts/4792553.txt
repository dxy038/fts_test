In this paper, a fuzzy logic controlled three-phase neutral-point clamped power factor correction (PFC) bidirectional rectifier is proposed. The fuzzy logic control is based on the linguistic description and does not require a mathematical model of the system. The outer loop PI voltage controller and the inner loop PI current controllers are replaced respectively by the fuzzy PI voltage controller and fuzzy PI current controllers. The performance of the fuzzy logic controller based converter is compared with the conventional PI controller based converter. The fuzzy controller based converter is relatively more robust than the conventional PI controller and gives better dynamic response of the converter. The MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Toolbox is used for implementing the fuzzy logic control scheme. Various simulation results are presented under steady-state and transient conditions to validate the utility of fuzzy logic controllers.

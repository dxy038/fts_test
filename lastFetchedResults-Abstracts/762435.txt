Background & Objective: Evaluation of prescriptions of doctors and particularly medical interns is an essential method for obtaining information about prescribing patterns and drug consumption. The present study aimed to assess the ability of prescription writing of medical interns and young doctors for common illnesses.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the ability of prescription writing of medical interns and recently graduated doctors was evaluated via objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) on ten common diseases in Sanandaj Medical School, Iran, in 2010.
Results: The average number of medicine for each prescription was 2.1 and the average score of participants in all stations was 62%. From the correct prescriptions 81.5% had appropriate medicine and 34.4% accurate dosage, and 21.3% with precise course of treatment. 24.1% had administered wrong drugs for patients. Half of the cases determined the correct treatment period. In terms of related factors the score of girls was better than boys (P = 0.03). However, there was no relationship between their ability and age, marital status, average mark of interns, or their medical exam score in pre-internship examination (r = 0.1).
Conclusion: Prescription writing ability of participants was relatively acceptable, but important issues such as drug dosage, frequency of consumption and course of treatment, which are essential in disease treatment, should be improved. Therefore, it is necessary to review medical education programs and curriculums.

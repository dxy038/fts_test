Using a computer has its advantages as well as disadvantages. The number of people who use the Internet in Malaysia has increased gradually, at the same time the number of threats that detected by various organizations also increased. [10] One of the threats to youth generations is pornography that spreads very fast via cyberspace or internet. The Southeast Asian countries have had a vigorous debate over pornography in recent years, exposing deep divisions with the Muslim-majority nation [1]. Another threat to Malaysian especially to the Muslim community is in the form of website contains seditious and harassment for the Muslim people. It is imperative that these problems be tackled and measured quickly. These issues have become important to resolve for the purpose of future generations. Many countries try to control these kinds of problems, but the measure has not been too effective. In this study, we proposed a collaborative system model among Malaysia Communication and Multimedia Communication (MCMC) as a regulator and law enforcer, Cyber Security Malaysia and Malaysia Department of Islamic Development (JAKIM) as the content advisor. The collaboration system model that we are trying to propose is to make the system for filtering content in Internet more efficient and faster in order to mitigate the spread of negative content. Our objective is to secure the youth generation especially Muslim community by filtering websites which contain pornography and seditious elements. However, it is not easy to collaborate with all these organizations and we might face the challenges.

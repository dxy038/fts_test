Practical optimization problems often require the evaluation of solutions through experimentation, stochastic simulation, sampling, or even interaction with the user. Thus, most practical problems involve noise. We address the robustness of population-based versus point-based optimization on a range of parameter optimization problems when noise is added to the deterministic objective function values. Population-based optimization is realized by a genetic algorithm and an evolution strategy. Point-based optimization is implemented as the classical Hooke-Jeeves pattern search strategy and threshold accepting as a modern local search technique. We investigate the performance of these optimization methods for varying levels of additive normally distributed fitness-independent noise and different sample sizes for evaluating individual solutions. Our results strongly favour population-based optimization, and the evolution strategy in particular

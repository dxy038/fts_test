Enhanced index tracking is a popular strategy in portfolio management that focuses on adding reliable value relative to the index on the basis of mimicking the behavior of the benchmark index. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization scheme for the enhanced index tracking problem, which provides the framework of defining the objectives as both maximizing the degree of beating the benchmark index and minimizing the accumulated error of underperforming the benchmark. Transaction costs are limited in the constraints. An immunity-based multi-objective optimization algorithm is presented to search for the solution of the enhanced index tracking problem. Treatment of infeasibility and solution selection are also presented. Our proposed approach is implemented to five data sets drawn from major world markets. The computational results compared with other published results show that our method has superior performance.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The variation of SPO2 and HR is a complication that threatens patients under operation and general anesthesia. Continuous monitoring of SPO2 and HR in all stages of anesthesia, especially induction and recovery stages due to early diagnosis of hypoxia. Fasciculation and shivering are also two common complications of general anesthesia. The aim of this study was to determine SPO2 and HR variations during fasciculation and shivering in general anesthesia.
METHODS: In this study, 100 patients in ASA class I and II aged between 15 to 60 were selected for rapid induction of general anesthesia by using succinycholine as a muscle relaxant. Premedication and induction of anesthesia were the same according to their weight. In the maintenance of anesthesia, halothan (0.5-1%), 02 (50%) and N20 (50%) were used. SPO2 and HR of patients were measured and recorded at I st and 3rd minutes after fasciculation and at 1st, 5th and 10th minutes after shivering and then data were compared.
FINDINGS: There were some changes in SPO2 and HR in both process that the most changes related to 1st and 3rd minutes after fasciculation and 1st and 5th minutes after shivering. Also, these changes during shivering were more severe that was statistically significant (1)-0.000). CONCLUSION: Results showed that the most decrease in SPO2 and increase in HR were related to the first stage after fasciculation and shivering that these changes can make some problems for patients with heart or pulmonary diseases. So, it is recommended that anesthesiologists should decrease the probable complications in patients under general anesthesia by continuous monitoring of SPO2, HR and necessary treatment.

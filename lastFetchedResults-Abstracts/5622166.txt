To increase the flexibility and responsiveness of the job shop problem (JSP) in the more competitive market, an integrated model of process planning and scheduling is formulated. A discrete particle swam algorithm has been developed to facilitate the integration and optimization based on the objective of minimizing production makespan. Each job is provided with multiple process plans. Their optimal process plan and scheduling are achieved simultaneously. The application of the procedure is demonstrated with an instance problem of 10 kinds of parts for 10 sets of machines.

An approach of tradeoff design for analog integrated circuits is presented. Different from only one specification is optimized in traditional approach, the weighted sum of several performance specifications are objective function of optimization in this approach. Each weight factor is defined according to the specificationÂ´s importance to a designer. Then the optimal solution will be the result of consideration for several performances. Analysis of weighted factors effect on optimized specifications is carried out. Hspice simulation result proves the optimization is accurate.

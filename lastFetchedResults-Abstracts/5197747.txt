The main objective is to present a method for distributing information regarding the trustworthiness of other nodes in the network. The process of managing incomplete trust in ad hoc networks is described. A protocol for distributing incomplete trust as rumors in an ad hoc network is described. The protocol is adapted to the CAM architecture, which is implemented in all network nodes. The CAM architecture provides the protocols and applications with an interface, through which they may store and retrieve values from a common database. The Rumor protocol thus uses this interface to retrieve trust values from the common database and broadcast them to the environment and to update trust values received from the environment.

Recently, terahertz (THz) technology has attracted a great deal of interest from academia and industry. This is due to a number of interesting features of THz waves, including the tens and hundreds of gigahertz bandwidths available, and the fact that this frequency band poses only a minor health threat. Also, as millimeter-wave communication systems mature, the focus of research is, naturally, moving to the THz range. According to Shannon theory, the broad bandwidth of the THz frequency bands can be used for terabit-per-second (Tb/s) wireless indoor communication systems (see "Terabit Versus Terahertz"). This enables several new applications, such as cordless phones with 360&#176; auto stereoscopic displays, optic-fiber replacement, and wireless Tb/s file transferring. All of these applications provide higher quality and a better user experience. Although THz technology could satisfy the demand for an extremely high data rate, a number of technical challenges need to be overcome or better understood before its development. This article provides an overview the state-of the-art in THz wireless communication and it is also a tutorial for an emerging application in Terabit radio systems. The objective is to construct robust, low-cost wireless systems for THz terabit communications.

Objective: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of two different concentrations
of
cryoprotectants
by
cryotopvitrification
on
survival,
developmental
capacity
and
Heat
shock protein 72 (Hsp72) expression of two-cell mouse embryos.   
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, transcript analysis of Hsp72 gene
was performed on non-vitrified and vitrified 2-cell mouse embryos via a nested quantitative

polymerase chain reaction (nqPCR) subsequent to normalization with Hprt1 as the
reference gene. The different cryoprotectant combinations were 15% (vit1
:7.5% of each
ethylene glycol (EG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 30% (vit2
:15% EG + 15% DMSO)
and control group with no cryoprotectants. Vitrified and fresh 2-cell embryos were cultured
to obtain cleavage and blastocyst formation rates. The results were analyzed via one-way
analysis of variance and the mean values were compared with least significant difference
(LSD) (p <  0.05).  
Results: The relative expression of Hsp72 in vit
2
 (30% v/v) was significantly higher than
vit1
 (15% v/v). Survival rates were the same for both vitrification treatments and significantly
lower
than
the
control
group.
Cleavage
and
blastocyst
rates
in
vit
1
 were significantly
higher than vit
2
 while those in two vitrified groups were significantly lower than the control
group. 
Conclusion: Our developmental data demonstrated that vit1
 treatment (7.5% EG and
7.5% DMSO) was more efficient than vit
2

 (15% EG and 15% DMSO) in mouse embryos.
The cryotopvitrification with two concentrations of cryoprotectants caused the relative
changes of Hsp72 transcript level, but the stability of the gene in vit1
was significantly
higher than vit2
 and closer to the fresh 2-cell embryos.

We have investigated 28 atherosclerotic plaques of human carotid arteries with a panel of 39 microsatellite markers for the presence of LOH. The objective of this research was to verify if LOH, described in association with tumorigenic process, could be involved also in benign fibroproliferative disease. Seventy percent of samples demonstrated allelic imbalance: 50% of cases showed LOH at a minimum of one locus, 3.5% at a minimum of two loci and 14.3% at three or more loci. The percentages of LOH ranged between 3.8 and 14.3% and the highest involved polymorphic marker is the NOS3 internal dinucleotide repeat. Our results indicate that, like tumorigenesis, the atherogenic process could also involve LOH mechanism. Furthermore, the finding regarding the NOS3 internal polymorphism suggests a possible role of the gene as cofactor in formation of the atheromas.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the meat quality and fatty acid (FA) profile of the muscle and subcutaneous fat of young bulls fed ground soybean grain (SB) or rumen protected fat (RPF) with (230 mg head− 1 day− 1) or without monensin. Forty animals with an initial weight of 359 kg were allotted in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. The use of monensin increased the arachidonic and α-linolenic acids in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle and subcutaneous fat, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). The meat from the animals receiving RPF had greater C18:1 content (P &lt; 0.01). The CLA and C18:2 contents were greater in the LD muscle of the animals fed SB (P &lt; 0.01). However, α-C18:3 was greater in the LD muscle of animals fed RPF (P &lt; 0.01). In the subcutaneous fat, SB reduced C12:0 and C14:0 contents (P &lt; 0.01) and increased C18:0 (P &lt; 0.05). The inclusion of RPF increased the C18:1 and CLA contents (P &lt; 0.01) in the subcutaneous fat. Soybean elevated PUFA contents and increased susceptibility of muscle and subcutaneous fat to lipid oxidation.

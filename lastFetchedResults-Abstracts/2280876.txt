As canola meal protein (CMP) has a lower arginine (Arg) content than soybean meal protein (SBMP), the main objective of this study was to investigate if replacing SBMP by CMP affected the incidence of pulmonary hypertension and ascites. Two hundred and seventy broiler chicks (Ross 308) were used to evaluate the effect of replacing CMP at proportionally 0, 0.5, and 1 for SBMP in a complete randomized block design, as mentioned in the Statistical analysis section (dietary treatments designated as CMP0, CMP0.5, and CMP1, respectively). The experiment was carried out on litter flooring from 6 to 42 days of age. The results indicate that broiler performance (body weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio) was significantly (P&lt;0.05) impaired in the CMP1 group at 6–21 days but not at 21–42 days. Inclusion of canola meal (CM) in the diet significantly increased ascites and total mortality (P&lt;0.05) and caused a decrease in the serum nitric oxide (NO) concentration with a concomitant increase (P&lt;0.05) in the right ventricular weight ratio (RV/TV). Haematocrit, circulatory triiodothyronine and thyroxine thyroid hormone concentrations and serum alkaline phosphatase activity were unaffected by dietary treatments. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that substitution of CMP for SBMP was associated with pulmonary hypertension (i.e., higher RV/TV) and ascites mortality in broiler chickens.

For the design of human resource management system, we proposed a multi-agent system. In this paper, we analyze the contemporaneity agent technology and discuss the method which is put in the design of human resource management information system to implement the management efficiency based on its characteristics of self management, reaction, cooperation, evolvement and communication. It deals with the multiagent-based human resource information system structure, constructs the corresponding system and discusses the design of the concrete functional module agent and the working process of the agent system. The structure of task agent and the whole system were described, and the process of system was discussed as well. The human resource management information system can communicate and researched by the objective, change with the environment actively and accomplish the given assignment of the human resource management. It provides a new model for the design of the human resource information system.

Summary form only given. Ring networks are widely regarded as the next step in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) telecommunications network evolution. An approximate analytical study is presented of idealized routing scenarios on practical ring-configured bus networks without wavelength conversion. The principal conclusion is that increasing the number of re-use wavelengths has greater impact on buses supporting mesh traffic, assuming a decrease in the number of wavelengths is the design objective.

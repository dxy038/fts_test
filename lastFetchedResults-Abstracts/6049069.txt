An optimization algorithm is developed to minimize the 2-norm of the transformed system matrix for a 2D state-space digital filter. The method is actually a two-loop Fletcher-Reeves-type method, where the line search is carried out using a combination of golden section ratio search and the method of false position. In general, the proposed method can be used to solve nonquadratic optimization problems where an analytic version of the objective function is not available

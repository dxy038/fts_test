In this contribution, a structural design concept, suitable for the application to passenger car tire development process is proposed. The focus is set on one hand on providing an appropriate multi-objective optimization approach, enabling the consideration of multiple requirements which a tire should satisfy during the operating life, and on the other hand on accounting for uncertainty within the design concept. Due to the fact, that some structural parameters, considered at design stage, are specified on the basis of vague, limited or imprecise information, it is required to model them as uncertain quantities. In this contribution, the uncertainty model fuzziness is utilized. The consideration of uncertainty in the design approach enables, beside the optimization of the objective functions, also robustness quantification and optimization. Numerical efficiency of the proposed methodology is increased through the substitution of the expensive FE tire analysis by a neural network based response surface approximation.

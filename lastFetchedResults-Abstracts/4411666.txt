The key-objective of the inspection process in Oil &amp; Gas offshore facilities is to assess the operational condition of all the equipment and infrastructure of the facilities on a continuous basis. It should also investigate the cause of accidents or failures, so that appropriate mitigation actions can be implemented. For the inspection of the submersed portion of the facilities, ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) are being widely used for visual and detailed inspections. ROVs represent a key component for the success of Oil &amp; Gas exploration in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. The Pre-Salt oilfields in Brazil present several challenges for exploration and production, as they occur under seawaters up to 2,400 m deep and are located around 300 km from the coast. Severe deep ocean conditions and complex logistics will enhance the requirements for advanced management of all production-related activities, which include technology, capabilities and management of the inspection processes.

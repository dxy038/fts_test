It follows an applied objective and the method for data collection is descriptive survey. Data are collected through library research; thus, questionnaires, interviews and documents were used. Data analysis was performed using T-test. The results suggest that there is the problem of multiplicity and lack of coordination among the policy-making agencies in developing policies for the nonformal skills training.

Sub-cluster statistics is a class different from the traditional statistical theory, witch is appropriate to statistics with two or more separate components for any independent system, has some physical meaning, and have been given practical application in chemical materials. Borehole strain data as an example, the theory is applied to the statistical time series analysis of seismic precursors, by quantitative simulation, access to the internal evolution in process of the earthquake in this paper. Through comparative analysis in normal and abnormal changes shows that the model can be integrated, quantitative and objective description for time series of earthquake precursory with dynamics, to highlight the possible anomaly information. This method has some versatility in the earthquake precursor data analysis, should be scalable and widely applicable, it is worth further research and exploration in earthquake precursory.

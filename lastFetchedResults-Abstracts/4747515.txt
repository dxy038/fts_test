The objective of this study is to investigate the near field coupling between a miniature loudspeaker and a nearby antenna. The analysis focuses on the loudspeaker voice coil radio frequency resonance characteristics and antenna radiation efficiency degradation due to the presence of the loudspeaker. Both measurement and simulation results are given to assess the impact of a loudspeaker when it is placed in close proximity with a monopole antenna mounted on a printed circuit board. This study leads to a better understanding to achieve optimum antenna-loudspeaker integrated module design for mobile devices.

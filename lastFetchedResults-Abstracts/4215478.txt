The free-space path loss is proportional to the square of the distance between a wireless transmitter and a receiver. The mathematical model of that can be used to determine the signal intensity of transmitted radio signal at a definite distance from the transmitting antenna. Nevertheless different environments present multipath effects and other active/ passive interferences that affect Received Signal Strength (RSS). Therefore pure mathematical models become less robust for object localization. The objective of this research was to conduct an empirical analysis based on received signal strength measurements in different environments using various wireless transmitters and receivers. Robust localization algorithm is developed by analyzing empirically obtained data sets. The system is tested for different terrains and frequencies with calibration.

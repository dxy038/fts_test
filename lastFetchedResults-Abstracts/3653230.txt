This article provides guidelines for the useful interpretation of AC/DC torque/current performance specifications, from a drive system\Â´s application perspective. The objective of this article is to bring those performance specifications that apply to torque/current regulation into technical focus and provide the reader with a basis for correctly interpreting them from a systems/application perspective. Future articles will address performance issues associated with "cascaded" and "parallel", position- and tension-regulation schemes. Speed-regulation issues are also addressed in this article.

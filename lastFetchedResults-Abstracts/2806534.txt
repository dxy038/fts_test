With an objective to improve the convergence characteristics of nonlinear active noise control (ANC) systems, this paper proposes a discrete cosine transform based adaptive algorithm for ANC. The performance of the new algorithm in terms of speed of convergence has been compared with that of the filtered-s least mean square algorithm. The improved convergence of the new algorithm is evident from the simulation experiments.

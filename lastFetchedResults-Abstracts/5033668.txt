The authors consider the problem of simultaneous placement and sizing of distributed piezoelectric actuators to achieve the control objective of damping vibrations in a uniform beam. For several closed-loop performance measures they obtain optimal placement and sizing of the actuators using a simple numerical search algorithm. These measures are applied to a specific example of a simply supported beam with piezoelectric actuators, and their relative effectiveness is discussed

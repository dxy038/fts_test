Background and Objectives: Disorders of height and weight growth are the most important health disorders affecting children younger than two in developing societies. Failure to treat these disorders can lead to the increased mortality and mental, emotional or physical disability. The objective of this study was to investigate the growth trends of children and the factors affecting it.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 2030 children younger than two in Khorramabad, Iran who were selected using stratified and cluster sampling. Based on household records, the weight growth trend was recorded as a four-level variable (decline, stagnation, slowness and desirable) and the the height growth trend was recorded as a three-level variable (stagnation, slowness and desirable); finally, the data were modeled using a longitudinal marginal model and the SAS software version 9.2.

Results: The incidence of at least one decline in the weight growth curve and one stagnation in the height growth curve was 14.2% and 10.4%, respectively. The child&rsquo;s age and the maternal educational level had a significant effect on the growth trends. However, the sex, parity and the exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months had no significant relationship with the growth trends.

Conclusion: Given the results and the relatively high prevalence of growth disorders among children, it seems that increasing the awareness of low literate women about feeding of the children is the most important approach to manage growth disorders. Additionally, health-care professionals should mostly focus on monitoring the growth of children older than 12 months.

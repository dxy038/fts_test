The objective of this paper is to explore the control of digital microfluidic system (DMS), capable of manipulate individual microdroplet on a cell-based electrode structure. Electro-wetting on dielectric (EWOD) has been developed to driving droplet, which plays an important role on Lab on a chip and BioMEMS. In this work, two kinds of electrode patterns are proposed to make mircodroplet moving on one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) chip. The controller, consisting of the driving circuit, direct current (DC) power supply, spring probes array and LabView software, was design to manipulate microdroplet.

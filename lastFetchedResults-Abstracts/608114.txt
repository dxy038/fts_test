    " The  Supernatural  Act "  is  one  of  the  certain  results  o f Endeavour  and  Gnostic mortification  and  concerning  to  and  focusing  on  Surrealistic  unconscious  mind;  that certainly  one  can  search  its  literature  in  lost  parts  of  human  history  ( Myths ). The effectiveness  on  Surrealism – in  theory  and  practice – with  a  viewpoint  of  Gnosticism, leads  to  appear  some  similarities  and  partnerships  between  these  two  schools ( regarding  basic  oppositeness's  and  distinctness's  within  Gnostic  and  Surrealistic Literature ), that  " The  Supernatural  Act "  is  objective  and  interesting  product  of  their relatively  common  programs.  Although  diversity  in  Supernatural  results  including Generosities, Discovery   and  Intuition, Objective  Events,  Witchcraft  and  Sorcery, Prediction  and  Divination  in  samples  of  Gnosticism  and  Surrealism  is  suitable  background  for  pretention  and  raving ;  in  the  other  hand  can  lead  to  the  Gnosticism's  philosophy  of  being  sequester  which  its roots  are in  the social  incidents  and  individual  reaction  of  Gnostic  literary  man;  and  in  second  place  in  Surrealist artist .

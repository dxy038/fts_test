This text presents a study in modeling a waiting list of liver transplantation, and the use of the resources that affects the system efficiency. The approach uses the graph theory to modeling the system as a workflow. The objective is to know how the system is, and how it will work after changing some parameters. The focus is the planning and the system management. The work encloses aspects of knowledge representation and optimization. An experiment is described and some conclusions are extracted

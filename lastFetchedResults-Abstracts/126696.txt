Background: One of the natural products in plants is essential oil. Their odor, components and properties are depended on factors such as genetics, climate, habitat and so on. In plant families, Apiaceae is rich in this biochemical group which has different effects in traditional and novel medicine.
Objective: Comparison of essential oil of two endemic plant of Iran from genus Zeravschania.
Method: Zeravschania membranacea (Boiss.) M. Pimenov was collected from Zanjan province in July 2003. The essential oil of powdered aerial parts of plant was prepared by hydro distillation which was about 0.1% (v/w) with yellow color and an intense odor. The essential oil was analyzed with GC/MS on DB-1 column.
Results: Thirty five out of forty eamponents, comprising 83.25% of total oil were identified. 44.64% were mono terpenes (15.19% oxygenated, 29.25% hydrocarbons), 7% sesquiterpenes, 7.8% phenyl propanoids and 22.81% nonterpenic compounds. The major components of the above fragments were alpha-Terpenyl acetate (6.6%), Carvacrol (5.95%), Thymol (4.76%), alpha-Ocimene Y (4.08%), beta-Bisabolen (3.24%), Trans-methyl iso Eugenol (7.74%), Thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether (16.7%).
Conclusion: Because of two different habitats and climates for growing Z. membranacea (sandy hill) and Z. pastinacifolia (rocky and scree steep slopes), there are some difference between content of essential oil in them.

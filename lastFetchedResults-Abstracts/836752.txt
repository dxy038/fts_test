The primary objective of this paper is to extend the results obtained by Habetler and Haddad [1] for the global asymptotic stability of a nonnegative equilibrium to a generalized Volterra-type system involving m species in n homogeneous patches and allowing diffusion between patches. The solution of the steady-state problem is shown to be equivalent to finding the solution to the Generalized Linear Complementarity Problem.

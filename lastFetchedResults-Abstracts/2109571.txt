 The present paper aims to compare Allameh Tabatabaei's view on the issue of secondary intelligibles with Suhrawardi's. For this purpose, after describing the views of Suhrawardi and Allameh Tabatabaei on the definition and classification of objective and subjective concepts, how these concepts exist outside and inside mind, the criterion of truth, comparison of the two concepts, manifestations of subjective concepts, etc., their views on the above issues are compared. The topics discussed in this paper reveal that both philosophers have achieved an understanding of subjective concepts and distinguish them from objective ones. However, Suhrawardi has not made any distinction between different kinds of subjective concepts and has mentioned philosophical and logical concepts on the same plane. As a result, he has founded logical convictions upon philosophical concepts; Allameh, however, makes division between secondary intelligibles and places philosophical and logical concepts in two separate groups; As such, he makes distinctions between their convictions.

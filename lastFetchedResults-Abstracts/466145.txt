Objective: This study was undertaken to compare the effects of single versus multiple courses of betamethasone therapy on the frequencies of neonatal outcomes and perinatal infectious morbidity among singleton pregnancies complicated by preterm delivery. Study Design: We performed a nonconcurrent prospective analysis of singleton pregnancies delivered between 24 and 34 weeks’ gestation after antenatal betamethasone exposure. Patients were categorized into two groups according to betamethasone exposure: (1) two 12-mg doses in a 24-hour interval on admission (single-course group) and (2) repeated dosing after the initial single course (multiple-course group). All patients received prophylactic antibiotics for group B streptococci. Any patients with ruptured membranes for >24 hours before delivery were excluded. Data were analyzed with the Student t test, the χ2 test, and the Fisher exact test. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the effect of each steroid dosing regimen on early-onset neonatal sepsis and neonatal death. P< .05 was considered significant for all 2-tailed tests. Results: A total of 453 patients were included, with 267 in the single-course group and 186 in the multiple-course group. The two groups were similar with respect to maternal demographic characteristics, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, birth weight, and maternal group B streptococcal colonization. Multiple courses were significantly associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis (odds ratio, 5.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-23.2), chorioamnionitis (odds ratio, 9.96; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-64.6), endometritis (odds ratio, 3.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-8.1), and neonatal death (odds ratio, 2.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.9). The frequencies of the other neonatal outcomes analyzed, including respiratory distress syndrome and grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage, were similar between the 2 groups. Multiple logistic regression analyses confirmed that multiple courses of antenatal betamethasone were independently associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.9) and neonatal death (odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.9). Conclusions: Multiple courses of antenatal betamethasone are associated with increased risks of perinatal infectious morbidity and neonatal death. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:810-4.)

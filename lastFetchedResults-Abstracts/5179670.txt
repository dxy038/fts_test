The results of a dynamic power conversion cycle selection process conducted as part of the Dynamic Isotope Power Subsystem (DIPS) program sponsored by the US Department of Energy (DOE) are presented. The objective of the DIPS program is to demonstrate the technology necessary to provide dynamic radioisotope space electrical power systems in the 1 to 10 kWe range to support evolving military and civilian missions in the early 1990s and beyond. Selecting the most appropriate DIPS power conversion cycle that would support this objective was an integral step in this process. The closed Brayton cycle was selected as the preferred power conversion cycle for the DIPS program based on an evaluation of several key areas of spacecraft power system performance: reliability, survivability, safety, scalability and growth, cost and schedule, and sensitivity to parameter variations

In the course of the More Electric Aircraft program frequently active three-phase rectifiers in the power range of several kilowatts are required. It is shown that the three-phase -switch rectifier (comprising three -connected bidirectional switches) is well suited for this application. The system is analyzed using space vector calculus and a novel PWM current controller modulation concept is presented, where all three phases are controlled simultaneously; the analysis shows that the proposed concept yields optimal switching sequences. Analytical relationships for calculating the power components average and rms current ratings are derived to facilitate the rectifier design. A laboratory prototype with an output power of 5 kW is built and measurements taken from this prototype confirm the operation of the proposed current controller. Finally, initial EMI-measurements of the system are also presented.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether urinary incontinence is more common in family members of women with incontinence compared with continent individuals. Study Design: Women who were examined at 2 different outpatient facilities over a 2-year period received a questionnaire that covered social, behavioral, and medical issues. They were also asked whether they had a family member who complained of urinary incontinence and, if so, the degree of the relationship. Subjects were excluded for the following reasons: not mentally competent, difficulty understanding the written English language, and a history of bladder cancer or of acquired or congenital neuropathy. Statistical analyses were conducted with chi-squared tests for differences between groups; a probability of <.05 was defined as significant. Results: A total of 833 women received the questionnaire; 667 women answered the question about urinary incontinence in family members. These 667 women were divided into 3 groups: group I, 441 incontinent women from the first facility; group II, 112 continent women from the first facility; and group III, 114 continent women from the second facility. Women with at least 1 relative with urinary incontinence were 34.9% in group I, 16.1% in group II, and 5.3% in group III. This difference was statistically significant. In a comparison of group I and group II, the odds that an incontinent woman had at least 1 relative with incontinence were 2.6 times higher (95% CI, 1.50-4.48); comparing group I and group III, the odds were 9.6 times higher (95% CI, 4.17-22.25). Conclusion: In our study population, women with urinary incontinence were more likely to have at least 1 family member also with incontinence when compared with women who were continent.

Electronic payment is widely use in all over the world, but it is not common yet in Iran. The objective of this research is to investigate customer adoption of electronic payments by empirically examining the adoption determinants that are specific for the electronic payment context. The study contributes to existing e-payment and adoption research by presenting a detailed description of factors that enhance and inhibit electronic payment adoption, and by giving propositions for future research of this emerging topic. For this aim, we are going to review some adoption theories and previous studies which have been done in adoption electronic payment area and extract the most significant factor and finally we are going to develop a appropriate model for electronic payment adoption for Iranian customers. The proposed conceptual model combines the TAM, diffusion of innovation and PCI models, adding the factors of security, cost, perceived risk, culture, trust, service quality and network externalities. Also the suitable methodology for doing this research will be explained.

The proposed general the problem of optimization for motion planning of articulated SCARA robotic structures, whose trajectories are subject to constraints, the stated objective is to obtain a sequence of collision-free positions that connect an initial configuration with end using search strategies based on heuristics working space, for which we use the space of the configurations. In order to evaluate the performance of this algorithm, we generated, simulated different work environments and the subsequent display of the planned collision-free paths, applied to articulated SCARA robot. To corroborate this work later this algorithm is implemented on an FPGA allowing varying some basic features of the robot.

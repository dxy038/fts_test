In this paper a particle swarm optimization algorithm based approach is presented for dwell time management of multiple multi function radars monitoring multiple sectors. Each radar can perform two functions, which are normal surveillance (NS) or search and track targets. Multiple radars are used to perform these functions for multiple sectors. A particle swarm optimization based algorithm evolves the optimal dwell time management. The dwell management affects the probability of detection of targets, as well as the surveillance coverage range. The first objective of the paper is to optimally allocate the dwell time of multiple radars to surveillance and track tasks to achieve the maximum coverage of the sector while achieving the required probability of detection for all the targets. In the second case, beams from multiple radars are used to track targets and improve the probability of detection. The objective is to optimize the coverage of each region as well maximize the probability of detection of different targets. The decisions of using radar resources, which are its dwell time and energy, have to be made in real time and arriving at optimal configuration is non trivial. The particle swarm optimization algorithm covers the targets by varying the range which each of the radar will cover in each sector. Particle swarm optimization is proposed to intelligently search and find the optimal time management. The ability of particle swarm to achieve and quickly converge to an optimal solution, which is a pattern of assigning functions to dwells and simultaneously setting the sectorÂ´s instrumented range for the multiple radars, is presented.

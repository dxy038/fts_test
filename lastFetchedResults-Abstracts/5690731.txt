Service composition constructs composite applications with different services to fulfill numerous service requirements. Different users have various QoS demands for composite services. In this paper, we present a service composition model considering not only multiple QoS constraints but also load balance factors. Moreover, a service selection algorithm based on niching technique and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for the service composition problem. It supports optimization problems with any kinds of constraints and objective functions. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient for service composition under any circumstances.

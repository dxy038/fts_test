the existence of a reliable routing is one of key and significant challenges in mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper, a
hierarchical routing protocol (HRP) is presented which is made of hybrid architecture combining reactive and proactive
protocols. The objective of the proposed protocol is to reduce the end to end delay and routing overhead. The presented protocol provides a hierarchical routing protocol using clustering mechanism and considering the CBRP protocol. Because of
reduction of the delay in responding to requests, gateways like cluster heads have a routing table. In evaluation of performance simulation results, it is shown that the proposed protocol has better efficiency than DSR and AODV routing protocols.

The perception-based approach of feature extraction methods for CBIR has been summarized. It has proposed an experimental analysis of mathematical modeling of textural contents for images, having a perceptual meaning and application such as coarseness, directionality, contrast, and busyness. An objective is to find an effective method to estimate perceptual features. So a cumulative use of computational intelligence to build a Knowledge Based Expert system for dental related diseases is proposed.

Substation expansion planning (SEP), as a major module of power system planning modules, is addressed in this paper. For long-term transmission SEP, a new approach based on a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization tool is proposed, in which by defining appropriate objective function and various constraints, new as well as expansion of existing substation requirements are determined. The proposed algorithm is successfully tested for the Iranian Power Grid in 2011.

Background
dial infarction has pronounced effects on an individual that demand changes in lifestyle. Health is influenced by whether the individual experiences the world as comprehensible, meaningful, and manageable, that is, has a sense of coherence (SOC). High SOC scores indicate that the individual probably manages the situation by understanding the context and connections: action and effect.
ive
udy objective was to identify the SOC, assess the quality of life (Short Form-12 Health Survey Questionnaire), assess the symptoms using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, and create health curves from a baseline for patients with a first myocardial infarction.
s
itudinal and predictive study of 100 participants in the heart care unit of a county hospital in southern Sweden was performed.
s
score lower on SOC than men. Persons with high SOC scores have fewer angina attacks, are more physically active, drink more alcohol, are more satisfied with their treatments, and have better disease perception.
sion
lowing SOC scores, a trend emerges that suggests it may be a useful tool for identifying those who will need extra support.

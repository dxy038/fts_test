This paper proposes a home network architecture integrated with WAP and SMS to support the connectivity between home and Internet/GSM networks. The home network architecture includes a HNG(home network gateway) and three subsystems. The main objective of the integrated system is to remotely monitor and control the devices in the Home Network via computer or GSM mobile terminal. In addition to responding to remote queries, the managed devices can actively send alerting messages to a mobile terminal when an abnormal state occurs. Through the HNG, the monitoring and control information is diffused to the Internet/GSM network. An implementation of the home network is described in this paper as an illustration of the feasibility of the proposed architecture.

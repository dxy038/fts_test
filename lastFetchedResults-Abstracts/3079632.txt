In real time applications of augmented reality, it is always matter of tracking; one of the most promising techniques in this sense is tracking based pattern. In this paper we describe a method based on the discrete Kalman filter for a real-time tracking of a 2D pattern for augmented reality. Objective being to make real-time tracking of a 2D pattern through a video stream on the simple personal computer; the process can be resumed as follow: in each frame we do an estimation by Kalman filter of predict corner location, after we proceed to correct this estimation by a measure around predict location, with Harris corner detection. the results obtains are very satisfactory, because all the process precede on real time and succeed to accurately track the pattern through video stream

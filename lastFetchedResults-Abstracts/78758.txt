A hybrid approach to the regularized inversion of highly parameterized environmental models is described. The method is based on constructing a highly parameterized base model, calculating base parameter sensitivities, and decomposing the base parameter normal matrix into eigenvectors representing principal orthogonal directions in parameter space. The decomposition is used to construct super parameters. Super parameters are factors by which principal eigenvectors of the base parameter normal matrix are multiplied in order to minimize a composite least squares objective function. These eigenvectors define orthogonal axes of a parameter subspace for which information is available from the calibration data. The coordinates of the solution are sought within this subspace. Super parameters are estimated using a regularized nonlinear GaussMarquardt-Levenberg scheme. Though super parameters are estimated, Tikhonov regularization constraints are imposed on base parameters. Tikhonov regularization mitigates over fitting and promotes the estimation of reasonable base parameters. Use of a large number of base parameters enables the inversion process to be receptive to the information content of the calibration data, including aspects pertaining to small-scale parameter variations. Because the number of super parameters sustainable by the calibration data may be far less than the number of base parameters used to define the original problem, the computational burden for solution of the inverse problem is reduced. The hybrid methodology is described and applied to a simple synthetic groundwater flow model. It is then applied to a real-world groundwater flow and contaminant transport model. The approach and programs described are applicable to a range of modeling disciplines.

This paper discusses the usability of web-based digital cameras in observing cow's behaviour in a barn with an automatic milking system (AMS). The objective was to establish the utility of new digital recording technology for observation of the milking process and to determine the reasons for deviations in AMS processes. Four web-based cameras were installed in an experimental barn with an AMS to follow the cleaning of the teats, the attachment of teat cups and the entire milking procedure. A total of 300 milkings were observed over a 3-day recording session. Digital recording equipment proved highly useful in allowing the stockperson to observe the cowsâ€™ visits to the automatic milking unit and to monitor their health status and the daily routines in the barn. While the AMS operation was good, the problem behaviour of few cows in the group had a marked impact on the milking process. To identify production risks, more attention has to be paid in adapting cows to the AMS as well as to observing deviations in the milking process. In addition, further development for automating the observation tools for detecting the deviations in the cow's behaviour and especially in the automatic milking process is needed.

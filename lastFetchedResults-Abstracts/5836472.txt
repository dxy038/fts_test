This paper presents a new architecture for flexible and secure networking in battlefields. Our architecture is based on the combination of optical (fiber) and wireless links. Our objective is to be able to carry on undeterred communication without the attack/eavesdropping nodes being able to detect the presence of any communications. We combine the advantages of optical links, such as high bandwidth, low delays, low error rates, good security, with the advantages of wireless links such as mobility and flexibility. From security point of view, we also assume presence of red zones, which are the ones controlled by the adversary or where the adversary can trace wireless activities. The advantage of fiber optical links was demonstrated in various military conflicts. On the other hand, in a dynamic environment, such as those of battlefields, it is expected that fiber cabling will be limited or difficult to be extended. Based on these assumptions we develop our hybrid wireless-optical protocol. The wireless communications are also optimized by searching the best tradeoff among coverage, energy use and security, which means that the wireless propagation should avoid overlapping with red areas, controlled by the adversary. In order to achieve the required optimization among the above mentioned factors, in our wireless protocols we change the transmission power (range) and the selection of retransmitting nodes.

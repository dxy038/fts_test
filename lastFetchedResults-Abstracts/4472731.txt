To support the new training aircraft being procured for the Air Force Primary Aircraft Training System (AFPATS), a suite of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) has been defined. As part of the Ground-Based Training System (GBTS) definition, it is necessary to identify the types of ATDs that are needed, to assign specific training objectives to each device, and to determine the number of devices required. The author discusses the methodology of using the results of the objectives and media analyses for identification of appropriate generic types of ATDs for each flight training objective. He addresses the use of Subject Matter Expert (SME) interview data and Training Effectiveness Ratios to establish the hours that must be provided by each training medium. For ground-based training, involving the acquisition of required knowledges, he presents the methodology for estimating training times, grouping objectives, and ensuring that the training can be accomplished within the program constraints. Following this, the method of using the training objectives to identify specific system component characteristics is presented

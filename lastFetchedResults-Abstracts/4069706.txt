The objective of this article is to develop a vehicle sideslip observer that takes the nonlinearities of the system into account, both in the theoretical analysis and the design. The design goals include reduction of the computational complexity compared to the EKF, to make the observer suitable for implementation in the embedded hardware, and a reduction in the number of tuning parameters compared to the EKF. Design is based on a standard sensor configuration, and is subjected to the extensive testing in the realist conditions.

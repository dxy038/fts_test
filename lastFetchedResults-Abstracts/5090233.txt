In this paper we revisit the problem of scheduling stabilizing control tasks on embedded processors. We start from the paradigm that a real-time scheduler should be regarded as a feedback controller that decides which task is executed at any given instant. This controller has for objective guaranteeing that software tasks meet their deadlines and that stabilizing control tasks asymptotically stabilize the plant. According to this feedback paradigm, the decision of executing control tasks should not be based on release times and deadlines but rather on the state of the plant. We investigate the feasibility of a simple state triggered scheduler based on the state norm and provide some schedulability results

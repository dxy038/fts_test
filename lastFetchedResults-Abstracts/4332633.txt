This paper proposes the network structure and services model to deliver new Traffic and Travel Information (TTI) value-added services over a hybrid-network of Terrestrial Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (T-DMB) and a bidirectional network. We have newly specified a POI (Point-Of-Interest) and a NWS (News Information) application services which are perfectly compatible with TPEG (Transport Protocol Expert Group) protocols, and implemented T-DMB based TTI systems including TPEG encoder/decoder and a return-channel server system through CDMA as a bidirectional network. We verified the proposed services and their related systems in the real-field environment and showed their excellent results in this paper<sup>1</sup>.

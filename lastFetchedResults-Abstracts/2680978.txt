 Background According to the Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM)
                            resources, myrtle (<i>Myrtus communis</i> L.) resolves
                            swelling, wounds and injuries; its wound exsiccation capability and
                            tissue enforcement properties may be helpful in the treatment of the
                            rhinosinusitis. Objectives The objective of the current trial was to
                            assess the effects of <i>Myrtus communis</i> aqueous extract
                            in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. Methods A total of 38
                            patients referring to the Masih Daneshvari Hospital (Tehran, Iran) for
                            the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis during the year 2016 were
                            recruited for a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial. They
                            were randomly allocated in 2 groups: 22 patients were in the treatment
                            group and 16 patients in the placebo group. Recruitment was based on the
                            European position paper on rhinosinusitis (EPOS). Patients’ data,
                            including demographic information, SNOT22 questionnaire scores, and
                            visual analog scale (VAS), were gathered and recorded by an
                            otolaryngologist. Patients were investigated with a CT scan of the
                            paranasal sinuses at the beginning of the study. Results A total of 13
                            patients (59.1%) in the treatment group were female and 7 in the placebo
                            group (43.7%). The median age of patients in the treatment group was
                            38.86 (18 - 68) and in the placebo group 39.93 (22 - 75) years. Data
                            analysis revealed that symptoms improved in the treatment group after
                            treatment in most parameters, according to the SNOT- 22 parameters.
                            However, most of these improvements, such as reduced concentration (1.81
                            ± 2.01 vs. 0.73 ± 1.32 in control vs. treatment group, respectively; P =
                            0.055), frustrated/restless/irritable (1.56 ± 1.97 vs. 0.55 ± 1.1 in
                            control and treatment groups, respectively; P = 0.113), as well as ear
                            pain (P = 0.121), did not demonstrate a statistical significance. There
                            was a significant improvement in symptom number 18 (reduced
                            productivity) in the SNOT- 22 questionnaire (1.69 ± 1.92 vs. 0.77 ± 1.23
                            in control vs. treatment group, respectively; P = 0.041). Conclusions
                            According to the present study findings, <i>Myrtus
                            communis</i> L. syrup can be safely administered in patients with
                            chronic rhinosinusitis and is effective in improving the outcomes of the
                            disease.

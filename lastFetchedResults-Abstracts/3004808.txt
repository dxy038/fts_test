The presence of flexibility in automotive drivelines, coupled with nonlinear elements such as gear lash leads to the presence of an undesirable oscillatory response to step changes in throttle input. This oscillation is generally low frequency (approximately 2 to 5 kHz) and can be of sufficient amplitude to cause driver discomfort and subjective disappointment with the driveability of the vehicle. A pole placement controller is developed for a "drive by wire" (electronically operated throttle) system, with the objective of reducing or eliminating the oscillatory response. Due to the inherent nonlinearities present in the system and the various constraints which must be applied to the controller design, the polynomial values for the pole placement controller are selected by the application of multi objective optimisation.

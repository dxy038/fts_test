The philosophy behind Post Registration Education and Practice (PREP) dictates that continuing professional education (CPE) must be tailored to the needs of the individual and relevant to the practice environment. The study is set within the context of PREP and other changes that are currently affecting midwives and midwifery educational establishments. This study sought to explore the CPE needs of midwives. The main objective of the study was to seek information on a number of issues that would assist with the planning and implementation of continuing education programmes to meet the needs of midwives. The study takes the form of a descriptive survey. Questionnaires were sent to 696 midwives employed by 7 National Health Service Trusts in the South-West of England. A 45% response rate was achieved. Seven midwife managers were also interviewed to gain insight into their perspectives of CPE and to enhance the findings from the questionnaire. Results show that midwives use a variety of strategies to identify their CPE needs. One of the more significant seems to be through interaction with colleagues. ‘Professional issues’ and ‘management topics’ were the categories identified by both midwives and managers alike to be the greatest need. There is a demand for part-time and distance learning. The format and timings that would ensure that midwives find it easy to attend CPE events were identified. Findings illustrate how midwifery managers and educationalists can facilitate midwives with their CPE and career development.

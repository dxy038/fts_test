Backgrouiid:Maior thalassemia in a common disease in Iran. One of the most common endocrine disorders in such patient in pubertal disorders that can be due to iron overload because of repeated transfusions .The objective of this study was the assessment of the relationship between mean serum ferritin level and indices of sexual puberty among thalassemic adolescent boys. In the case of such association, beginning treatment in appropriate age , the pubertal delay can be prevented in such patients.
Methods:In this cross- sectional descriptive study, 100 boys aged more than 12 with major thalassemia were assessed in Seyedolshohada hospital, Isfahan.

The correlation between pubertal indices and serum LH, FSH, testostrene and ferritin were assessed.

Data were analyzed by SPSS/win software at P<0.05 The correlation between variables was assessed by Pearson correlation test.

Results: According to the findings of the present study, an inverse significant association was found between serum mean ferritin and sexual hormones LH, FSH and testosterone (r=-0.5,-0.6, P<0.05)
In addition a significant difference was shown between testis size and mean serum ferritin level (P=0.02). Overall 69% of subjects studied hold pubertal delay.

Discussion & Conclusion: Considering the inverse relationship between serum ferritin and sexual hormones, as well as testicular size as the onset of puberty, the necessity of assessment of pubertal stage and controlling serum ferritin level is suggested for prevention of pubertal delay as one of other complication of iron overload in thalassemic patients.

This paper develops novel broadcast algorithms for mobile ad hoc networks to improve efficiency and provide guarantee for full delivery of broadcasting. An important objective is to reduce broadcast redundancy and to avoid the broadcast storm problem. It proposes two broadcasting algorithms such as, Sender based algorithm and Receiver based algorithm. The proposed Sender based algorithm selects subset of forwarding nodes using 1-hop neighbor information. It can reduce both the computational complexity of selecting the forwarding nodes and the maximum number of selected nodes in the worst case. The proposed receiver based broadcasting algorithm can significantly reduce redundant broadcasts in the network. It decides whether or not to broadcast the message. The probability of two neighbor nodes broadcasting the same message exponentially decreases when the distance between them decreases or when the node density increases. The receiver based algorithm uses the Responsibility based scheme which further reduces the redundancy. The proposed algorithms improve the efficiency and also guarantee full delivery.

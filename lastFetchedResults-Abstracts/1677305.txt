The production of biohydrogen through anaerobic fermentation has received increasingly attention and has great potential as an alternative process for clean fuel production in the future. The monitoring of the stages of anaerobic fermentation provides relevant information about the bioprocess. The objective of this study is to propose a novel methodology for simultaneous analysis of sucrose, glucose, fructose and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), such as, acetic, propionic, isobutyric and butyric during anaerobic fermentation by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The following chromatographic conditions were optimized: column Aminex HPX-87H, mobile phase consisting of H2SO4 0.005 mol/L, flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and temperature of 55 Â°C. Sucrose, glucose and fructose were analyzed by refractive index detector (RI) while acetic, propionic, isobutyric and butyric acids were analyzed by ultraviolet (UV) detection at 210 nm. Some analytical parameters of validation, such as, linearity, selectivity, repeatability, intermediate precision, limit of detection and quantification, accuracy and robustness were evaluated. The proposed methodology was successfully applied in the determination of substrates and metabolites during different stages of biohydrogen production.

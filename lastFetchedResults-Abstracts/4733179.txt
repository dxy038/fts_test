In Swedish forestry, reliable forest parameters are needed for both short and long term planning. The traditional methods used for acquiring forest data at reasonable accuracy are very expensive and labour intensive. Therefore, new cost-effective methods for data collection must be used to meet the requirements being imposed on timber supplies and environment conservation. Based on promising results obtained earlier in relating VHF SAR data to forest stand parameters a pilot project has been defined. The objective is to develop a fully integrated system for retrieval of forest parameters using VHF SAR images. A representative data set covering 625 km<sup>2</sup> of predominantly conifer-forested terrain was collected with the CARABAS-II sensor in November 2000 as an initial step

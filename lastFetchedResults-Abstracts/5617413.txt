This paper introduces an AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method which optimizes the weight of test sections in CET-4 in order to assess students´ communicative competence. The AHP method begins with a questionnaire administered to English teachers from a university. The returned questionnaires are summarized and analyzed by mathematical approach and statistic software to generate the objective weights. The proposed weight is compared with the former weight in the discussion, and the conclusion is considered as a reference for making decisions in weight adjustment of CET-4. The case indicates that the results by AHP method reflect the college English teachers´ professional agreement of assessment priority in college English education.

Objective
This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and morbidity of 2 minimally invasive procedures for stress urinary incontinence.
Study design
This was a prospective randomized multicenter trial; 190 women with primary urodynamic stress incontinence were randomly assigned to tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) (n = 95) or intravaginal slingplasty (IVS) (n = 95). The primary and secondary outcome measures were rates of success and complications. SPSS software was used for data analysis.
Results
At 2 years 92 and 87 patients were available in the TVT and IVS group for outcomes analysis. Subjectively, 80 (87%) and 68 (78%) women were cured, respectively. Objectively, a 1-hour pad test was negative in 78 (85%) and 63 (72%) patients. Eight of the patients assigned to IVS (9%) had vaginal erosion/infection, compared with none in the TVT group (P< .01).
Conclusion
Both procedures were effective for stress incontinence, but 9% of women treated with the IVS required removal of the tape for erosions.

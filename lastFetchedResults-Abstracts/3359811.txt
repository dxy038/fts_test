Modern development of semiconductor power-switching devices has promoted the use of power electronic converters as power transformers at the distribution level. This paper presents an ac-ac dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter for a solid-state transformer. The proposed converter topology consists of two active H-bridges and one high-frequency transformer. Four-quadrant switch cells are used to allow bidirectional power flow. Because power is controlled by the phase shift between two bridges, output voltage can be regulated when input voltage changes. This paper analyzes the steady-state operation and the range of zero-voltage switching. It develops a switch commutation scheme for the ac-ac DAB converters. Experimental results from a scaled-down prototype are provided to verify the theoretical analysis.

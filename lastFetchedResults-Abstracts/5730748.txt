The application of the neural computing network concept to the minimax optimization is presented. According to the method the minimax programming problem is first transformed to the standard single-objective optimization problem and then solved by transforming it to the set of ordinary differential equations. The clustered connection-type interpretation of the neural-based minimax approach is given. The numerical results of some chosen examples are also presented

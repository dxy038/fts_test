Objective-The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ultrasound therapy on cell counts and the depth of healing of the rabbit’s skin scar. Method-Under general anesthesia and sterile conditions, four full-thickness incisions were made on the back of seven rabbits. The first, second, third and fourth wounds were selected for ultrasound therapy, placebo ultrasound, application of lubricant gel and betadine, respectively. Ultrasound therapy program (1 MHz, pulsed 2:8, 0.5 Watt/cm2 and 4 minutes duration) and other treatments were performed daily from day zero to day 30. On day 30, the rabbits were sacrificed by ether and tissue samples were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E). The fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils and endothelial cells were counted and the depth of the scars and new epidermis was measured with special eye pieces. Finally, data was analyzed with the analysis of variance method. Results-The highest number of fibroblasts, macrophages and neutrophils belonged to the placebo group, the highest number of endothelial cells and depth of scars were present in the gel group, while the highest mean new epidermis depth belonged to the ultrasound therapy group. However, none of above-mentioned results were statistically significant. Conclusion-According to this study, ultrasound therapy has no beneficial effect on the incisional wound scar tissue of rabbit’s skin.

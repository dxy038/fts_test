Background & Objective: Simulation is an educational technique which through providing whole or part of a clinical experience helps students to learn without being afraid of either their personal weaknesses or hurting the patient during interaction. Manipulation of medical education is widely being spread all over the world and this can be due to various factors such as technological improvements, ethical issues relating to practicing clinical skills, crowdedness of clinical environments for educational purposes, illness severity in most patients, drop in the length of patient’s stay in the hospitals, shortage of specialized staff in hospitals to facilitate educational process and so on.
Methods: The current study has reviewed existing books, library references, papers and essays available in different scientific databases using keywords of “simulation”, “medical education” and “clinical skills”.
Results: Simulation offers several advantages including increase in patient’s safety, reinforcement of interactive learning and student-centered, improvement in problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills, and self-paced learning. Despite all the above-mentioned benefits, the point is that due to the high costs of simulation equipment as well as improper cost management policies particularly in educational centers, several studies should be run to analyze outcomes of manipulation of different simulators on students’ learning and then based on the efficiency of the simulators, the proper ones be used for educational purposes in clinical environments.
Key Words: Simulation, Medical education, Clinical skills

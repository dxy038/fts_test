This paper deals with how to characterize texture and how to get a good description of images with a minimal number of parameters. This procedure is more objective than textual data. Texture characterization has been used in a matching system to detect changes in couples of aerial images taken at two different times using different order of statistics to describe images. The results are quite encouraging.

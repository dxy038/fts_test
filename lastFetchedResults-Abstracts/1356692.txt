The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) in dry cleaning shops in Tehran, Iran. PCE and TCE are two most prevalent solvents in dry-leaning shops. Air and effluent samples were collected in October to December 2011 from 10 dry-cleaning shops. Analyses were performed by head-space gas chromatography technique. Gas chromatography with FID detector is used for analysis. Mean PCE levels in the air of ten dry-cleanings ranged from 42.7 to 516 ?gL-1 with maximum level of 960, PCE mean levels in the effluent ranged from 186.5 to 292.9 ?gL-1 with maximum level of 326. Mean TCE levels in the air effluents ranged from 29.5 to 543.7 ?gL-1 with maximum 964 and 25.5 to 29.75 ?gL-1 with maximum level of 37 ?gL-1 respectively. The survey of the PCE and TCE in dry-cleaning shops in Tehran shows that both air and effluent have been contaminated by PCE and TCE. These solvents have several negative health effects. Health education is essential for workers.

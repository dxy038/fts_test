One method of storing electrical energy in distribution networks is network reconfiguration. Reconfiguration in power systems can change the network topology and power flow with use of switches that can be closed and open. The main objective of the reconfiguration of distribution networks is reducing power losses and avoid network from overload. Reconfiguration is numerical optimization. Changes between open and close mode of switches should be done in such a way that the radial configuration remains radial. This study proposes a new optimization algorithm to solve the reconfiguration problem based on hybrid of particle swarm and NelderMid(NM) optimization algorithms which is called PSONM. Simulation results on real network indicate that this new hybrid algorithm is more efficient and faster in comparsion with genetic algorithm.

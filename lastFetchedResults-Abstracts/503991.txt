The decline of western states governed by Islamic caliphate and the fall of Andalusia are of the most important phenomena of medieval ages within the whole Islamic and Christian instructions that the researchers are dealing with. As paying heed to its roots and causes prompted Ibn Khaldun to write a well celebrated book of (Muqaddimah). From the most significant characters of Andalusia's fall is its position throughout the western Islamic caliphate history and its relations with the European states. To understand the reasons of the very decline is counted to be the most important theoretical foundation of Occidentalism. These reasons within a collection of social, political, economic and religious incidents slowly and gradually paved the way towards the decline of Andalusia. The key objective of the research is to measure out the truthfulness of Ibn Khaldun's theory justifying the reason behind the fall of Andalusia. With a historical exploration of the above mentioned reasons it can be understood that the fall of Andalusia remains out of Ibn Khaldun's suggested process. Another noteworthy character from a historical perspective in exploration of this incident is to consider the first pattern of analytic historiography in the history of Islamic historiography.

A novel photonic technology for generation and distribution of mm-wave signals in advanced radio systems is described. Experimental results on the distribution of 60 GHz signals to more than 1000 micro base-stations by fibre-optics are presented. Furthermore, a demonstrator which offers a bidirectional air interface at 30 GHz is introduced.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

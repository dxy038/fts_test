In this paper, a new control strategy for control of a distributed generation (DG) unit in islanding mode is proposed using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The potential of the proposed approach for optimal setting of the conventional lead-lag controller has been investigated. When connected to the utility grid, the DG is controlled by interface voltage source converter (VSC) which employs a conventional dq-current control strategy for control of active and reactive power components. In islanding occurred time and confirmation, the dq-current controller is disabled and the proposed PSO based tuned controller is used for the control of the DG unit operating with its local load. The proposed controller parameters tuning problem for the DG unit is converted to an optimization problem with the time domain-based objective function which is solved by a PSO which has a strong ability to find the most optimistic results. The robustness of the proposed controller is verified under different operating conditions in comparison with the classical controller through time domain simulation. The results analysis reveals that the proposed PSO based control strategy has an excellent capability in achieving good robust performance than the genetic algorithm and enhances greatly the dynamic stability of the systems against load parameters uncertainties.

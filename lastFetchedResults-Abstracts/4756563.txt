The objective of this paper is to present a basic study of rapid object recognition in full scene of high resolution SAR image. In this paper the recognition is viewed as a recipient of information from two sources: a scene containing the object to be recognized and a geo-database indicating the location of the objects to be recognized with feature class. Using the prior information offered by geo-database and SAR imaging model, the efficiency of object recognition is improved rapidly.

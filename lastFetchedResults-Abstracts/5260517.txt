The use of mobile devices grows significantly in all situations of day-to-day. The intense rhythm of the mobile device market has been pushing the use of practical software development and accelerated implementation. Both development activities hand the testing for these applications has proven challenging. A number of reasons, indicate that conventional software testing efforts are not successful in mobile applications. The testing automation approach for mobile applications, in most of the cases, does not cover all of the application features, which makes the manual test using devices necessary. The challenge is even greater in projects with agile methodologies, where test automation is one of core parts of the development process. In this work, the main objective is the sharing of the biggest challenges that are faced, especially during testing of mobile applications from the point of view of product quality; as well as the same may be supplied with the collaboration of the entire team in an agile development environment. For this purpose we will use a real project with NFC technology as example.

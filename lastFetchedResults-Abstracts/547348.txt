Priority and posteriority are two abstract concepts which originate in objective facts. They are sometimes among the accidents of existent qua existent, and an existent as such is qualified with them. Sometimes, two things share the same relation to an ontological source in terms of their existence with the difference that one might have a greater share than the other.
The present paper examines the problem of priority and posteriority in potency and act. Initially, the writer presents the ideas of those who believe that pure potency is prior to act. Then he explains Mulla Sadra's idea in this regard and finally examines the different kinds of the priority of actuality to potency.

A multichannel sound reproduction system aims at offering an immersive experience exploiting multiple microphones and loudspeakers. In the case of multichannel acoustic echo cancellation, a suitable solutions for overcoming the well-known non-uniqueness problem and an appropriate choice of the adaptive algorithm become essential to improve the audio reproduction quality. In this paper, an advanced system is proposed based on the introduction of a multichannel decorrelation solution exploiting the missing-fundamental phenomenon and a combined multiple-input multiple-output architecture updated by using the multichannel affine projection algorithm. Experimental results proved the effectiveness of the presented framework in terms of objective and subjective measures, providing a suitable solution for echo cancellation.

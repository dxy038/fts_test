This paper presents an objective evaluation of various eye movement-based biometric features and their ability to accurately and precisely distinguish unique individuals. Eye movements are uniquely counterfeit resistant due to the complex neurological interactions and the extraocular muscle properties involved in their generation. Considered biometric candidates cover a number of basic eye movements and their aggregated scanpath characteristics, including: fixation count, average fixation duration, average saccade amplitudes, average saccade velocities, average saccade peak velocities, the velocity waveform, scanpath length, scanpath area, regions of interest, scanpath inflections, the amplitude-duration relationship, the main sequence relationship, and the pairwise distance between fixations. As well, an information fusion method for combining these metrics into a single identification algorithm is presented. With limited testing this method was able to identify subjects with an equal error rate of 27%. These results indicate that scanpath-based biometric identification holds promise as a behavioral biometric technique.

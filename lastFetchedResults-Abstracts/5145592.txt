A new Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) algorithm which is based on an adaptive lattice filter is presented in this paper. The new approach generates the lost packets by using lattice structure synthesis model and its excitation. The model parameters estimation relies on packets received, preceding and succeeding to the lost one. The algorithm is compared to ITU and ANSI recommendations for G.711 PLC, and to the zero stuffing approach as a lower bound. The algorithm evaluation consists of objective methods and an informal subjective test. The objective measure used is the MOS-LQO measured by the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) algorithm. The test vectors used in the proposed PLC evaluation are the ITU P-Series Sup.23 database and the TIMIT database. The proposed lattice based algorithm outperforms in comparison with the other PLCs evaluated in the paper, especially in high loss rates.

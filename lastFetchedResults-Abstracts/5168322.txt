Conflict is inevitable to take place in collaborative design, and conflict resolution plays an important part in complex product collaborative design systems. Firstly, a mathematic description model in collaborative design considering resource conflict, process conflict and design conflict is given, and the mathematic model expresses the origin of conflict and shows that conflict resolution is a multiobjective planning problem. Next, a conflict resolution algorithm considering design objective optimization is presented, and fuzzy value and fuzzy grade are applied in the algorithm. Depending on both considering design variables having fundamental influences on its design objectives and the cost of conflict resolution, the algorithm can improve the quality and efficiency of conflict resolution. Finally, an example of single cylindrical gear reducer is used to show the validity of the algorithm.

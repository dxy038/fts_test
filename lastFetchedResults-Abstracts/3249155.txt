On-board battery charger is an essential component of a plugin vehicle. Bidirectionality, even though not realized yet in charging systems of commercial plugin vehicles, is being seriously considered for future developments, due to provision of V2G capabilities. This paper first presents the structure of a high performance two-stage, level-2 on-board bidirectional battery charger, as the interface between the utility grid and the plugin vehicleÂ´s battery pack. Then, a comparative evaluation of three control schemes based on PI controller, synchronous DQ-frame model and PR controller, for grid-side AC-DC converter is performed. Simulation results are used to support the analytical expectations.

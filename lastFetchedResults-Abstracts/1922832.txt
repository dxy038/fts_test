The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between adiponectin levels and incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). We performed a prospective case–control analysis nested in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort. Participants were apparently healthy men and women 45 to 79 years of age who developed fatal or nonfatal CHD during an average follow-up period of 7.7 ± 1.1 years. In total 1,035 participants with incident CHD were matched for age, gender, and enrollment time to 1,920 controls who remained free of CHD over the study follow-up. Baseline nonfasting plasma adiponectin concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Adiponectin levels were lower in participants with CHD than in matched controls (men 8.74 vs 9.13 μg/ml, p = 0.01; women 12.6 vs 13.4 μg/ml, p = 0.03). A 1-μg/ml increment in adiponectin was associated with decreased CHD risk (odds ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.96, p = 0.02, in men; odds ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.96, p = 0.03, in women). However, this association was no longer significant after adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors. Stratification of participants according to metabolic syndrome status showed that men and women with metabolic syndrome had a higher CHD risk, irrespective of their adiponectin levels. In conclusion, although a low adiponectin concentration is associated with an increased CHD risk, findings of the present study do not suggest that its measurement is useful to refine CHD risk assessment once traditional risk factors and clinical features of the metabolic syndrome have been considered.

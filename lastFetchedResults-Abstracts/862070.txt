Background: Prevalence of obesity and overweightness in different
societies is increasing. Role of physical activity in weight loss and also
prevention from some chronic diseases has been discussed previously.
The objective of this study was to compare the effect of two different
aerobic exercises (intermittent and continuous exercises) while prescribed
with concurrent calorie-restrict diet on the weight loss and body fat of
overweight and obese females.
Methods: Fifteen individuals in intermittent group performed 40 min
moderate Intensity exercise in 3 bouts per day for 5 days per week; the
15 participants of continuous group exercised a single 40 min bout
per day, 5 days per week. Also, 15 participants were included in control
group without exercise program. A self-monitoring calorie-restrict diet
was recommended to all participants. The body fat percentage, waist
circumference, and also skin fold thickness of all participants were
assessed at baseline and 12th weeks.
Results: The reduction of weight and BMI of participants in intermittent
group (-3.33 ± 1.80 and -1.34 ± 0.70, respectively) was significantly
more than comparable changes in continuous group (-1.23 ± 1.60 and
0.49 ± 0.65, respectively) (P = 0.048 and 0.041, respectively). After
the intervention, there was no significant difference between case and
controls in terms of body fat percentage, waist circumference, and sum
of skin fold thickness.
Conclusions: It seems that moderate intensity intermittent exercise for
more than 150 min/ week is more efficient than continuous exercise in
weight loss of obese and overweight women.

The work is focused on modeling and simulation of a supply vessel from a static and dynamic perspective. The aim of the work is to highlight the necessity to implement zonal protection scheme to respect DP3 (Dynamic Position 3) constrains in case of severe busbar faults, operating the system with the tie breaker closed. The model developed is characterized with a complete representation of a ship for Platform Supply - Vessel (PSV). The model represents also the full protection system (static and dynamic) in accordance to the fine tuning conducted on the real system. The work is also focused on the representation of electromechanical model the propulsion power converters. The main objective and the innovation of the work is to demonstrate the ability to sustain severe busbar faults, respecting the DP3 requirement using zonal protection, using a full dynamic model of all the ship electrical system.

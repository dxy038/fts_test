This paper illustrates the performance evaluation methods for bidirectional optoelectronic circuit boards (OECBs) operating at 10 Gb/s. A typical OECB consists of flip chip surface mount optical transceiver modules and polymer optical interconnects. The evaluation techniques include direct current and high-speed optical characterizations of individual components, subsystems, and interconnect. A methodical procedure to validate optical waveguide, vertical cavity surface emitting laser, photodiode, high-speed optical characterization of transmitter, receiver, and optical link is described.

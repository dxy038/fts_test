In this paper, we consider the problem of how to measure the reliability of the large-scale wireless sensor networks, which is a fundamental requirement of wireless sensor networks deployment. Sensing coverage and network connectivity are key QoS requirements of wireless sensor networks, while network lifetime based on energy efficiency and invulnerability based on fault-tolerance are two main factors to measure network reliability. Therefore a novel reliability model to prolong the network lifetime and improve robust ability of wireless sensor network is proposed in detail, which is based on certain K-coverage and K-connectivity constraints in order to support different QoS requirements with various applications or environments. Afterwards, a wireless sensor network example is simulated in the article to validate the reliability model, and the relationship between reliability value and sensor density is studied further. Topology control algorithm with this reliability model as optimization objective is under working

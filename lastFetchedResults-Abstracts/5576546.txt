A decision support tool for production planning is discussed in this paper to perform the job of machine grouping and labour allocation within a machining line. The production plans within the industrial partner have been historically inefficient because the relationship between the cycle times, the machine group size, and the operator´s utilisation hasn´t been properly understood. Starting with a simulation model, a rule-base has been generated to predict the operator´s utilisation for a range of production settings. The resource allocation problem is then solved by breaking the problem into a series of smaller sized tasks. The objective is to minimise the number of operators and the difference between the maximum and minimum cycle times of machines within each group. The results from this decision support tool is presented for the particular case study.

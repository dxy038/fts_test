This study presents an initial application of total maximum daily loads (TMDL) process in Tiaoxi river to protecting its decreasing water quality through TMDL assessment in various critical conditions scenarios for main streams and tributaries based on numeric water quality standard. Annual TMDLs was estimated in four patterns of flow regimes in order to satisfying multi-objective requirements and then illustrated the seasonal variation of TMDL and selected the appropriate daily load expression for Tiaoxi river. The results of indicate that velocity positive impacted the loading capacity, daily TMDL analysis may not be practical way for load allocation and pollution discharge elimination because of insufficient monitoring data and fund support, a non-daily TMDL with medium temporally variable daily load expression would be a better selection for TMDL development in Tiaoxi river.

This paper describes research that investigates the application of augmented reality (AR) in 3D animation of simulated construction operations. The objective is an AR-based platform that can be used together with corresponding equipment (HMD, GPS receiver, and a portable computer) to generate a mixed view of the real world and superimposed virtual simulation objects in an outdoor environment. The characteristic that distinguishes the presented work from indoor AR applications is the capability to produce real time updated output as the user moves around while applying minimum constraints over the userÂ´s position and orientation. The ability to operate independently of environmental factors (e.g. lighting conditions and terrain variations) makes the described framework a powerful tool for outdoor AR applications. This paper presents initial results and an AR platform prototype (UM-AR-GPS-ROVER) that is able to place 3D graphical objects at any desired location in outdoor augmented space.

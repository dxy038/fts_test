Objective: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is characterized by the presence of multiple plaques within the central nervous system, manifesting as remission and exacerbation of neurologic dysfunction over variable time courses. Sensorineural hearing loss is an uncommon symptom of multiple sclerosis. Clinical presentation of multiple sclerosis is highly heterogeneous. The aim cf this study was to determine the quality of hearing in MS and to evaluate prognosis. Subjects and Methods: We studied 16 cases with confirmed MS who visited ENT clinic of Emam Khomeini Hospital of Ahwaz Jundishapur University between April 2003 to March 2005. Clinical, electrophysiological, auditory brain stem response (ABR), ??? (ENG) and MRI radiological assessments were undertaken. In addition, the cochleovestibulat systems of these patients were also evaluated after treatment.
Results: The cases studies included were 7 males and 9 females with mean age of 32.5 years. In MS patients a wide range of symptoms due to lesions in different areas of the brain and spinal cord were recoded. Two of 16 cases had sensory neural hearing loss, with abnormal ABR, both patients had normal tympanometry and had no acoustic reflex. Conclusion: Further research is required to explore the variability in the levels of ability and functioning. The findings of this research work suggest that in patients with MS can show various abnormalities in the vestibulocochlear system and a multidisciplinary evaluation is required to be undertaken by investigating otolaryngologists.

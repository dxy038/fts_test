Three glycosilated flavonoids (diosmin, hesperidin and naringin) and respective aglycones were characterized in terms of their apparent ionisation constants and bidirectional permeability using the cellular model Caco-2 as well as the artificial membrane model PAMPA. Ionisation curves were established by capillary electrophoresis. It was confirmed that significant amounts of the aglycones are ionised at physiological pH whereas the glycosides are in the neutral form. Permeation was not detected for the glycosides in either the apical-to-basolateral or basolateral-to-apical directions confirming the need for metabolism before absorption through the intestinal membrane. The aglycones permeated in both directions with apparent permeabilities (Papp) in the range of 1–8 × 10−5 cm/s. The results from both in vitro methods correlated providing some evidence of passive transport; however, the hypothesis of active transport cannot be excluded particularly in the case of diosmetin. Metabolism of the aglycones was detected with the cell model, more extensively when loading in the apical side. Some of the metabolites were identified as glucuronide conjugates by enzymatic hydrolysis.

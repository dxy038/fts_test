The objective of this work is to analyse the storage–flux hysteretic behaviour of a simplified model for subsurface flow processes. The subsurface flow dynamics is analysed by means of a model based on the kinematic wave assumptions and by using a width weighting/depth averaging scheme which allows to map the three-dimensional soil mantle into a one-dimensional profile. Continuity and a kinematic form of Darcy’s law lead to a hillslope-storage kinematic wave equation for subsurface flow, solvable with the method of characteristics. Adopting a second order polynomial function to describe the bedrock slope and an exponential function to describe the variation of the width of the hillslope with hillslope distance, we derive general solutions to the hillslope-storage kinematic wave equations, applicable to a wide range of hillslopes. These solutions provide a physical basis for deriving two geometric parameters α and ψ which define the hydrological similarity between hillslopes with respect to their characteristic response and hysteresis. The hysteresis η, quantified by the area of the hysteretic dimensionless loop, has been therefore computed for a range of values of parameters α and ψ. Slopes exhibit generally clockwise hysteretic loop in the flux-storage plot, with higher groundwater mean volume for given discharge on rising limb than at same discharge on falling limb. It has been found that hysteresis increases with decreasing α and ψ, i.e. with increasing convergence (for the shape) and concavity (for the profile), and vice versa. For relatively large values of α and ψ the hysteresis may take a complex pattern, with combination of clockwise to anticlockwise loop cycles. Application of the theory to three hillslopes in the Eastern Italian Alps provides an opportunity to examine how natural topographies are represented by the two hillslope hydrological similarity parameters.

In this paper an evolutionary multi-objective optimization approach is applied to extend fuzzy multi objective problem considered by Jeng-Jong Lin [1] and Gupta et al [2, 3]. In our extended work, the concept of fuzzy [6, 8] due time is applied to increase satisfaction grade of customers and to meet their demands much better as well as to decrease the delay times of vehicles, which service customers during their desired period of times, so the objectives are as follows: maximize the loading capacity of vehicles, minimize the distance travelled by vehicles, minimize the waiting time of customers, maximize the satisfaction grade of customers, minimize the delay times of vehicles.

Management models enabling the coordination of Active Demand and new additional loads, such us plug-in electric vehicles, with the objective of supporting the network performance under the constraints of the grid security and quality of supply, are essential to make the distribution system capable to offer services for power system operation. In the paper, an intelligent and decentralized Multi-Agent System for handling electric vehicles charging control and Active Demand programs management in the LV distribution networks is proposed. The optimization algorithm proposed allows designing valid and effective demand response and electric vehicles charging system, able to analyse and meet the vehicle charging needs to contribute to the voltage control of the distribution network. Application examples are presented in order to illustrate the algorithm effectiveness.

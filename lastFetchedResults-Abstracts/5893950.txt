The emerging vehicular networks will enable a variety of applications for safety, traffic efficiency and driver assistance. However, the highly dynamic connectivity between vehicles makes the vehicular ad-hoc communication especially challenging. Networked Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are increasingly being deployed in automobiles to realize various functions and Controller Area Network (CAN) is deployed for the communications among ECUs. In order to deal with the high broken link rate due to the mobility of vehicles on the road, our primary objective is to develop a route selecting algorithm that uses extracted CAN messages and ECU signals for the reliable vehicle communications. By taking the vehicle information such as speed, acceleration and turning signal from CAN messages and ECU signals into consideration, we develop a route selecting algorithm to improve the reliability of AODV (Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing protocol. By implementing our route selecting algorithm in the AODV-UU software, the initial test with multiple cases shows that our designed algorithm can choose the more reliable route for vehicle communication.

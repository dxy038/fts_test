Up to day, there are only a few published works describing algorithms to solve diagnosis problems for batch bioreactors. This problem implies fault diagnosis in batch processes. The objective of this work is to develop a special strategy that allows build a real time expert system for such cases. The methodology is checked by implementing a prototype for fault diagnosis in a cell cultivation bioprocess for production of bioinsecticides

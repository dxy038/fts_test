The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of jig color and depth variations on squid catchability in Iranian waters of the Oman Sea (Bandar-e jask and Chabahar). Two different colors of jigs (green and blue) were used together in same angle. A total of 2270 (1119 Kg) squid were captured by automatic machine during the study. Purpleback Flying squid (S. oualaniensis) with 96.5% of the total catch was the dominated species and Indian squid (L. davauseli) was also found rarely. The number of 1247 (weight: 603.3 Kg) of this value was belong to green type of jig and 1023 (weight: 515.7 Kg) were caught by blue type of jig. Catch rates were calculated 5.188 Kg h-1 and 3.8 Kg h-1 for green and blue jigs, respectively. According to t-test results, wasn’t significantly difference between catch rates of squid with green and blue jigs (P > 0.05). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test proved that the size composition of dorsal mantle of caught squids didn’t differ signi?cantly between different jig colors (P > 0.05).  Result of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test showed that the catch rate of squid was higher in shallower waters (P < 0.05).

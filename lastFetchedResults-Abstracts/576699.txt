
Objective: In previous studies it has been emphasized that the site of morphine action may be either in the embryo or the placenta. In the present study, we attempt to identify the site of morphine action on the fetal section of Wistar rat placenta by using C
-morphine.
Materials and Methods: In this study (experimental), female Wistar rats (weights: 170-200 
g) were mated with male rats and their coupling times recorded. Experimental groups received
daily doses of 0.05 mg/ml of C
14
-morphine in their drinking water. On the 9
 embryonic days, the pregnant rats were anesthetized and the placenta and uterus surgically
removed.
Placentas
were
fixed
in
10%
formalin
for
two
weeks,
then
processed,
sectioned
in

5
µm
and
25
µm
thicknesses,
and
fixed
on
glass
slides
for
further
evaluation.
The

25
µm
sections
were
delivered
to
black
and
white
film
for
three
days.
Films
were
processed

and
evaluated
with
a
digital
inverse
microscope
for
possible
radiological
impression.
The
5

µm
sections
were
processed
for
hematoxylin
and
eosin
(H&E)
staining,
and
evaluated
by

light
microscope and MOTIC software.

Results: Our results indicated that the site of action of C
-morphine was possibly located on the blood plexus of the fetal portion of the placenta. In addition, oral morphine
consumption
was
shown
to
inhibit
fetal
and
maternal
placental
development
in

the
experimental groups.

Conclusion: We conclude that morphine’s effectiveness on the reduction of embryo growth and development may be via its effects on the blood plexus of the fetal section of the placenta.

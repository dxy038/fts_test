Objectives
tion of disease requires a firm understanding of the relevant environmental and modifiable risk factors. We present a comprehensive review of these factors in renal cell carcinoma.
als and methods
rature search of the PubMed database was performed to identify clinical studies examining the relationship between environmental and modifiable factors in the development of renal cell carcinoma (terms utilized: kidney cancer; renal cell carcinoma; risk factors; environment; obesity; hypertension; trichloroethylene). An emphasis was placed on more recent studies.
s
ontrol and large cohort studies have examined the relationship of numerous environmental and modifiable factors and the risk of renal cell carcinoma. Of particular note are dose-dependent increases in smokers, the obese, and hypertensive patients.
sions
nmental and modifiable risk factors contribute significantly to the risk of sporadic renal cell carcinoma. Emphasis should be placed on smoking cessation and hypertension control. Emerging evidence would suggest that dietary intake and quality impact renal cell carcinoma risk.

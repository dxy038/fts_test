Objective: In recent decades, B-glucans have been used as important complementary and alternative medicines for numerous immunocompromised individuals and those with advanced cancer. The most active form of B-glucans is B(1,3)D-glucan and its  most common source is cell wall of Candida albicans. Recently it has been introduced as a nano particle design to be used as a carrier for drug delivery. The current study researches a rapid method for the extraction of B(1,3)D-glucans. 
Methods: The present study was conducted at Tarbiat Modares Medical University in 2012. Candida solubilized B-glucans were obtained by oxidation of the cell wall with sodium hypochlorite and sodium hydroxide. The particle part could be solubilized by treatment with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and zymolyase digestion to extract B(1,3)D-glucan. The soluble fractions were lyophilized. We performed the Callose test to verify the presence of B(1,3)D-glucans. Solubilized fractions were dissolved in D2O and 1H-NMR spectra were measured.
Results: The soluble B(1,3)D-glucan fraction which was derived from 1 g of dried Candida albicans germ tube weighed 190 mg. B(1,3)D-glucan was verified by the Callose test and 1H-NMR test compared with Curdlan (standard). 1H-NMR spectra verified the existence of B(1,3)D-glucan in the final product.
Conclusion: In the present study, extraction of B(1,3)D-glucan by oxidation of the cell wall using sodium hypochlorite yielded more pure B(1,3)D-glucans in comparison with other extraction methods. Thus it might represent a rapid method of extraction.

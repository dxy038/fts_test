The potential of a pulse compression technique has been experimentally evaluated for speckle reduction processing. Multifrequency and multibandwidth data were obtained from a speckle generating medium using frequency modulated pulses. Speckle decorrelation factors and loss of axial resolution were quantified. The technique is shown to be successful in its primary objective but some additional advantages need further exploration.

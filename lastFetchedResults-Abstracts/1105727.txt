The objective of this paper is to investigate and reduce the impact of the errors in the planetary ephemerides on X-ray pulsar-based navigation system for Earth-orbiting satellite. Expressions of the system biases caused by the errors in the planetary ephemerides are derived. The result of investigation has shown that the impact of the error in Earthâ€™s ephemeris is must greater than the errors in the other ephemerides and would greatly degrade the performance of X-ray pulsar-based navigation system. Moreover, the system bias is modeled as a slowly time-varying process, and is handled by including it as a part of navigation state vector. It has been demonstrated that the proposed navigation system is completely observable, and some simulations are performed to verify its feasibility.

In view of the high complexity of designing perfect reconstruction non-uniform filter banks with the conventional approach, a simple and efficient method for designing non-uniform filter banks has been presented. It appropriately relaxes the complicated limit conditions of perfect reconstruction. The design problem of non-uniform filter banks is reduced to the problem of minimizing the objective function. In this paper, a new Bio-inspired algorithm-Memetic algorithm is used to optimize the objective function which satisfies perfect reconstruction condition. Window functions of Blackman family are used to design FIR prototype filter, this filter is also optimized by using the new windowing technique, with the novelty of exploiting spline functions in the transition band of the ideal filter. The simulation results illustrate the proposed method and its improvement over previous methods in the terms of reconstruction error and amplitude distortion, the new windowing technique further optimizes the performance of non-uniform filter banks.

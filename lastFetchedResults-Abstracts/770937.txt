The objective of this research is to examine the extent to which phylogenetic and geographical drivers of rarity may interact to help us better predict distributions of rare taxa. This information is useful to conservation biologists when considering plans for the effective capture of biological diversity within reserve systems. We use 33 floras, distributed globally among five biomes, to assess pattern of rarity across taxonomic group size for plants. We show that small plant families (1â€“10 taxa) contain consistently fewer rare taxa than expected, while rare plants are proportionately over-represented in large plant families (>100 taxa). We also examine the distribution of species within families. The degree to which species are inequitably distributed among families varied systematically across floristic biomes. Mediterranean floras, in particular, are characterized by a greater than expected fraction of their species pool concentrated within large families, suggesting a high propensity for rarity simply by virtue of having a higher proportion of their constituent taxa within groups with a high likelihood of rarity. Finally, an analysis of a suite of floras using a common system of identifying rarity shows that the fraction of species within floras that are rare is predicted both by flora size and by a general metric (the Gini coefficient) of inequality among family sizes. Together, these patterns suggest a high degree of predictability in the distribution of rarity in plants that may reflect underlying natural speciation and extinction processes.

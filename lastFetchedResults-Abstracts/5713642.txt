Reliability design optimization method of gravity dam section is put forward in this paper. Considering the failure probability of gravity dam is very small required in specification, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and subset theory are combined and applied to calculate the reliability of gravity dam. The minimization of initial cost and failure cost of gravity dam is optimization objective. In addition, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is introduced to get the optimization design project of gravity dam section.

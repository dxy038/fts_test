Background and Objective: Pre-eclampsia is characterized by hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
increased systemic inflammatory response and has been associated with an increased maternal risk
of cardiovascular disease later in life. Endothelial dysfunction is thought to be a central pathogenic
feature in pre-eclampsia on the basis of elevated adhesion molecules. The aim of the present study
was to compare the level of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in sera of normal
and pre-eclamptic pregnancies.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we studied the serum level of sICAM-1in
peripheral blood obtained from normal pregnant women (n = 40), mild pre-eclampsia (n = 37) and
severe pre-eclampsia (n = 38). Concentration of soluble adhesion molecule was determined using
enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA).
Results: There was no difference in the mean plasma sICAM-1 between normal pregnant women
and mild pre-eclamptic women. Serum concentration of sICAM-1 was significantly higher in severe
pre-eclampsia (p < 0.05) than normal pregnancy. There was also significant differences in s ICAM- 1
levels between mild and severe pre-eclampsia (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: These results suggest that soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 is increased in
severe pre-eclampsia, and sICAM-1 may be useful in predicting the severity of pre-eclampsia.

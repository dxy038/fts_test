ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Similar to other wounds, episiotomy could lead to infections and delayed recovery. Since olive oil has antibacterial and wound healing properties, this study aimed to compare the effects of cold compress with gel packs and topical olive oil on the recovery of episiotomy wounds in primigravid women.
METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted on 90 primigravid women referring to the hospitals affiliated to Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Subjects were randomly allocated to two groups of cold compress with gel packs (20 minutes within 12 hours after delivery, for 10 days if necessary) and topical olive oil (twice daily, within 12 hours and 10 days after delivery). Episiotomy wound healing was evaluated using the REEDA scale within the first 12 hours postpartum, and on days 5 and 10 after delivery (IRCT:201409164529N12).
FINDINGS: In this study, there was no significant difference in demographic features and other intervening variables between the two groups. However, a significant difference was observed between the study groups in terms of redness severity on the 10th day of postpartum (p=0.04). Mean of the REEDA score was 1.02±1.13 and 0.84±0.97 in the cold compress and topical olive oil groups, respectively. On day 10 after delivery, scores were determined as 0.47±0.96 and 0.2±0.5 in the cold gel pack and topical olive oil groups, respectively.
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, topical olive oil could be used effectively for episiotomy wound healing in primigravid women.

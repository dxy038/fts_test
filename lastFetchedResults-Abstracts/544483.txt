Objective: This study was performed to determine whether melatonin at
physiological concentrations (0.01-10nM) could affect the proliferation and
osteogenic differentiation of Rat ADSCs in vitro.
Materials and Methods: ADSCs were isolated from the fat of adult rats. After
cell expansion in culture media and through three passages, osteogenesis
was induced on a monolayer culture with osteogenic medium with or without
melatonin at physiological concentrations (0.01-10nM). After 4 weeks cultures
were examined for mineralization by Alizarin Red S and von Kossa staining and
for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity by ALP kit. Cell viability and apoptosis
were also assayed by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-
2-(4-ulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay and flowcytometry, respectively. All
assays were performed in triplicate.
Results: The results indicated that at physiological concentrations, melatonin
suppressed proliferation and differentiation of ADSCs. These data indicate that
ADSCs exposed to melatonin, had a lower ALP activity in contrast to the cells
exposed to the osteogenic medium alone. Similarly, the mineral deposition
(calcium level) also decreased. The flow cytometry proved that the cell growth
decreased and the apoptotic cells increased.
Conclusion: These results suggest that physiological concentration of
melatonin has a negative effect on ADSCs osteogenesis.

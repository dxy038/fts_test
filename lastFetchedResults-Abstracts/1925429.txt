The objective of this study was to assess the effects of soy oil sources, dietary vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation onserum and yolk total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) and contents and egg oxidative stability in laying hens.A total of 300 Hy-line variety W-36 laying hen with 44-wk of age were used. Twelve corn-soybean meal-based diets containing; 3.5% refined soybean oil (SBO), recycled soybean oil (RSO), or acidulated soybean oil soapstocks (ASO) each containing two levels of vitamin E (0 and 250 mg/ kg diet), or two levels of vitamin C (0 and 250 mg/ kg diet) were used in a completely randomized design trial with a 3×2×2 factorial arrangement.The yolk oxidative stability was determined on 3 groups of fresh eggs after refrigeration at 5°C for 1, 15, and 30 days.The results showed that serum concentrations of TCand TG, and yolk TC content were not affected by dietary oil sources (P > 0.05). Dietary inclusion of RSO and ASO, however, increased (P < 0.05) egg TG content. Although dietary supplementation of vitamin E had no marked effect on serum and egg lipid profile, supplemental vitamin C decreased (P < 0.05)egg TG. No interaction of dietary fat sources and vitamin supplementation was observed on serum TC and TG or egg TC. However, there was a positive interaction between vitamin E and vitamin C for yolk TG content, so that the presence of both vitamins had more reducing effect on yolk TG.On the other hand, 30 days egg storage decreased (P < 0.05) yolk oxidative stability and dietary vitamin E supplementation improved stability index.These results confirm the fact that egg triglyceride is more prone to dietary manipulation compared to egg cholesterol

The objective of this study was to evaluate a mobile photovoltaic/genset hybrid system under field test conditions to determine its reliability and operating characteristics, A power trailer that combines photovoltaic panels, a battery bank, and a backup propane generator is described. This PV genset trailer is known as the solar energy response vehicle (SERV). The testing included preliminary characterization tests and system operation through several operating cycles

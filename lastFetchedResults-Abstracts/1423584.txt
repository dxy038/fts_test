Development of genome-scale metabolic models and various constraints-based flux analyses have enabled more sophisticated examination of metabolism. Recently reported metabolite essentiality studies are also based on the constraints-based modeling, but approaches metabolism from a metabolite-centric perspective, providing synthetic lethal combination of reactions and clues for the rational discovery of antibacterials. In this study, metabolite essentiality analysis was applied to the genome-scale metabolic models of four microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, chokepoints, metabolites surrounded by enzymes that uniquely consume and/or produce them, were also calculated based on the network properties of the above organisms. A systematic drug targeting strategy was developed by combining information from these two methods. Final drug target metabolites are presented and examined with knowledge from the literature.

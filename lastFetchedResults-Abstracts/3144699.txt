Increase of functions and improvement of performance required on board aircrafts, associated to the limited amount of available areas and volumes to implement the equipments, and with an objective of cost management, drive an approach leading to the reunion of functions operated in various frequency bands, to the reduction of thickness of the antennas and to the standardization of constitutive building blocks. Technical and technology research is being conducted on wideband and multi-band radiating structures, and the overall architecture has to deal with the various requirements, including optimization of performance and reduction of costs.

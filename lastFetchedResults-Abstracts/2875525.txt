Digital flight is the study commonly called flight simulation. In flight simulation analysis, the biggest challenges are about preparing the complete databases that can be invoked as result files in future. The ability to simulate in a computer regarding the flight motion must be convinced the governing equations of motion for six-degree of freedom. The accuracy of a flight simulation depends to a large extent on the quality of an aerodynamic model database prediction. Key objective is to fly and simulate an aircraft in a computer environment with sufficient level of autonomy under the interest variables. In order to realize the goals, a surrogate model is used as the prediction function based on sampling data obtained by the design of experiments. The sample data for models are acquired from the USAF Stability and Control DATCOM which is considered as exact function, and a database is constructed for two main variables angle of attack and Mach number along the X-force axis, Z-force axis, and pitching, rolling and yawing moment respectively. Furthermore, a comparison value of exact and predicted function was compared through the Means Square Error (MSE). The validation for the digital flight was qualified through the mode motion analysis and flying qualities scale to prove the mission level of the flight status.

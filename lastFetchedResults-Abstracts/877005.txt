Using M-matrix and topological degree tool, sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence, uniqueness
and global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of bidirectional associative memory (BAM)
neural networks with distributed delays and subjected to impulsive state displacements at fixed instants of
time by constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional. The results remove the usual assumptions that the
boundedness, monotonicity, and differentiability of the activation functions. It is shown that in some cases,
the stability criteria can be easily checked. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness
of the presented criteria.

A multi-scenario, multi-objective optimization method of a grid-parallel Microgrid (MG) is presented aiming for more comprehensive and accurate assessment of a grid-parallel MG. First, different operational modes of a grid-parallel MG are analyzed and sorted. Normally, the MG will connect with the energy deliver system most of the time, providing functions such as peak shaving, system reserve. But it is also required to operate separately from the grid in planned or unplanned island mode due to different reasons, e.g., power outage, abnormal weather. Then, a multi-objective optimization method to size MG based on different operational scenarios study is proposed. The objectives consist of MG construction and operation cost, reliability cost, ancillary values, utilization of renewable energy and emission. An improved customer outage cost analysis method is demonstrated taking power outage reasons and reliability requirement of load into consideration. A demonstration MG considered in this paper consists of PV, wind turbine (WT), diesel generator, converter and battery energy storage. The results prove that the method presented is sound and effective.

Outsourcing has become a widespread phenomenon of globalization in recent decades, while it is quite applicable to promote productivity of large industries. On the other hand, foreign direct investment (FDI) and its spillovers have been also recognized widely as a growth factor in investment. FDI not only provides capital but also introduces advanced technology that can improve the factor productivity of the host countries. In addition, trade openness can improve competitive characteristics so that they have positive effect on total factor productivity (TFP), particularly in developing countries.
The objective of this research is to explore the main determinants of TFP, and particularly to know how FDI spillovers, R&D expenditures and international outsourcing affect TFP in the selected East and West Asian countries. Accordingly, a panel TFP regression model is estimated using data of the considered countries over the period 1996-2005.
The implication of the study is in fact a plan for integration between two Asian blocks (East and West) through enhancing trade relations.

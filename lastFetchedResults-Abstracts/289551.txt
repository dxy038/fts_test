Objective
To investigate whether elastin-derived peptides (EDP) are detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy controls and of patients with acute brain ischemia and if so to assess possible trends in EDP levels in different groups of ischemic stroke patients (small-vessel disease vs. other ischemic strokes; first-ever vs. recurrent stroke).
Patients and methods
Levels of EDP were determined by ELISA in blood sera and CSF of 80 patients with acute ischemic stroke (mean age 61.5 ± 10.8; age range 47–70; 22 women) and in 15 healthy age- and sex-matched controls (mean age 57.3 ± 13.4; age range 50–65). The patients were divided into a group with first ever lacunar stroke (27); first ever non-lacunar ischemic stroke (27) and recurrent stroke (26). EDP were measured early (mean 7 days, range 1–15) after stroke onset.
Results
Serum EDP levels were mildly higher in recurrent strokes as compared to first ever lacunar lesion and controls. However, in the CSF the concentrations of EDP in stroke patients were strongly elevated (from 2 up to 30 times depending on subgroup) as compared with healthy subjects. The highest level of EDP in CSF and in the serum was found in recurrent strokes. Subgroup analysis revealed a trend for significantly higher EDP concentrations in CSF in lacunar and recurrent stroke as compared with non-lacunar.
Conclusions
This study is the first application of elastin peptide measurement to human CSF and stroke patients. The increased levels of EDP were detected in CSF of patients with lacunar and recurrent strokes.

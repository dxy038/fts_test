Beef longissimus dorsi colour, marbling fat and surface texture are long established properties that are used in some countries by expert graders to classify beef carcasses, with subjective and inconsistent decision. As a computer vision system can deliver objective and consistent decisions rapidly and is capable of handling a greater variety of image features, attempts have been made to develop computerised predictions of eating quality based on these and other properties but have failed to adequately model the variation in eating quality. Therefore, in this study, examination of the ribeye at high magnification and consideration of a broad range of colour and marbling fat features was used to attempt to provide better information on beef eating quality. Wavelets were used to describe the image texture of the beef surface at high magnification rather than classical methods such as run lengths, difference histograms and co-occurrence matrices. Sensory panel and Instron analyses were performed on duplicate steaks to measure the quality of the beef. Using the classical statistical method of partial least squares regression (PLSR) it was possible to model a very high proportion of the variation in eating quality (r2 = 0.88 for sensory overall acceptability and r2 = 0.85 for 7-day WBS). Addition of non-linear texture terms to the models gave some improvements.

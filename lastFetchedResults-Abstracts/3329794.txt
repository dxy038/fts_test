This paper presents a new characterization setup for Printed Electronics. The proposed system allows automatic generation of experiments, optical and electrical characterization, and statistical result analysis of full printed foils. Although its primary objective is the extraction of the needed post-layout corrections, due to its modular design, it can extract other technology information, like Design Rule values or overall printing quality of the whole fabrication process.

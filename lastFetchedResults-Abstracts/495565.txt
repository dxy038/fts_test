In this article I explore attributions of credibility, important to designations of ‘expertise’, within the
area of DNA patenting. I define ‘credibility’ as a relationship of recognition people establish to
other actors. Through repeated interviews, interspersed with the provision of information, I have
identified two different ways in which respondents position themselves in relation other actors
as a way of assessing their credibility: when assuming a ‘partisan position’, they explicitly draw
on ideological convictions; when assuming a ‘hierarchical position’, the ranking of credibility
depends on how informed and objective others are perceived to be. The positions embody different
roles for the respondents as ‘citizens’ and as ‘lay persons’, respectively; that is, they indicate
the possession of contrasting ideas about their own relevance in policy matters. This raises the
question of how to interpret the fact that people disqualify themselves from policy making, seeing
themselves as incompetent. Challenging current conflict-focused models in the public understanding
of science (PUS) literature, I argue that the hierarchical position can be interpreted as a broader
desire for consensus. In the patent area, I show that paying attention to the hierarchical position is
crucial to understanding why an industry representative is regarded by some to be a credible
‘expert’. The study sheds light on the ‘public understanding of expertise’ more broadly, and within
the bioeconomic field in particular.

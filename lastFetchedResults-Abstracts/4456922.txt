On the basis of geographical characteristics data of Datong city, Shanxi Province in China, this paper presents a deep first search algorithm for solving photovoltaic battery assignment problem. It uses a multi-objective optimal procedure to decide the fitness batteries in combination of different capacity or type as a basic element group, and then find the solution for a given building. Several reasons are considered in this model: the sun angle and economy reasons. The results of computation al experiments show that proposed method performs well and reliable, and the procedure can be used as an effective method to provide solution for photovoltaic battery assignment.

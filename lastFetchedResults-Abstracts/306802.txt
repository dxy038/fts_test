Objective: To establish a plasma calibration curve for the Advantage™ Blood Glucose System that would permit direct comparison with results provided by clinical laboratories.
Design and Methods: The initial study involved the comparison between the Advantage whole blood referenced results and the laboratory plasma results. The second study validated the plasma-compatibility of the first new lot of Advantage test strips with this new calibration curve.
Results: Plasma and whole blood glucose data, obtained at Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont in Montréal, demonstrated the typical differences between these two sample types. Mathematical correction of the Advantage results eliminated this difference. This new equation was then encoded into the code keys of a new lot of Advantage test strips and a second study was conducted to verify the comparability to laboratory plasma glucose.
Conclusion: The results for the Advantage™ Blood Glucose System may now be compared directly with the laboratory plasma or serum glucose results

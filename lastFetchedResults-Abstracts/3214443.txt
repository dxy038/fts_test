This paper proposes an optimization based approach in allocating transmission line losses and also load flow in integrated power system network. The idea of this approach is taken from the way of real honey bees to search food or foraging activity by flying in their surrounding comb for getting the optimum value of food. The objective function in this optimization process for transmission line losses and load flow allocation is to minimize the value of mismatch power generated by power flow solution and result given by Artificial Bees Colony Algorithm (ABC). For the validation of the proposed method two bus system has been tested i.e. 5-bus system and IEEE 14-bus system.

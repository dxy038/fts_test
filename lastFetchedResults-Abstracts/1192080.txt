A stochastic fuzzy multi-objective programming model is developed for supply chain outsourcing risk management in presence of both random uncertainty and fuzzy uncertainty. Utility theory is proposed to treat stochastic data and fuzzy set theory is used to handle fuzzy data. An algorithm is designed to solve the proposed integrated model. The new model is solved using the proposed algorithm for a three stage supply chain example. Computation suggests an analysis of risk averse and procurement behavior, which indicates that a more risk-averse customer prefers to order less under uncertainty and risk. Trade-off game analysis yields supported points on the trade-off curve, which can help decision makers to identify proper weighting scheme where Pareto optimum is achieved to select preferred suppliers.

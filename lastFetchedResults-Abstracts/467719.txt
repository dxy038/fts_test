OBJECTIVE: Aims of our study were as follows: (1) to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the preoperative administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog before laparoscopic myomectomy and (2) to assess whether any ultrasonographic parameter of the fibroids (number, size, Doppler velocimetry, or echogenicity) was of prognostic value. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized study was performed on 67 patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids that were mainly intramural; these patients were undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy. Patients were randomized either to preoperative administration of two injections of a depot formulation of leuprolide acetate 28 days apart (group A, n = 35) or to direct surgery (group B, n = 32). In each group we studied the number, volume, and echogenicity of the larger fibroids; the resistance index of uterine arteries and of fibroid vessels; hematologic parameters; operative time; and blood loss. RESULTS: The two groups did not differ significantly in basal ultrasonographic parameters and hematologic data. Postoperatively, the red blood cell count and the serum hemoglobin and iron levels were significantly (p< 0.05) lower in group B. Both blood loss (p< 0.01) and operative time (p< 0.05) were significantly lower in group A. However, the operative time was significantly longer when the main fibroid was markedly hypoechoic, probably because the increased softness of the tumor after leuprolide acetate pretreatment makes its enucleation much more cumbersome. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the therapeutic efficacy of preoperative administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog before laparoscopic myomectomy in reducing the blood loss and in decreasing the operative time. This preoperative course of leuprolide acetate in hypoechoic fibroids, because of the further reduction of the density of the myomas, causes a significant (p< 0.05) increase in operative time.

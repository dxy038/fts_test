From the origin of man\´s study of space comes guidance on today\´s security matters - particularly as they impact and place burdens creating challenges for effective logistics and supply chain management activities. There is evidence that observations and experiences from space throughout the millenniums have inspired ways to enhance security and to minimize vulnerabilities while facilitating the teaching of logistics and supply chain management. Security issues that are being dealt with today strategists and planners responsible for the transport and safe-keeping of goods and the well-being of logistics services providers include that of the threat and response; global positioning systemization for remote sensing capabilities within passive and active RFID systems; software algorithms capabilities built into equipment to allow "intelligent" or "smart" decisions to be made in remote areas of operation; observation of earth for the forecasting and monitoring of natural disasters and of organize crime, as well as the armed threat of forces from an adversary; new communication techniques, small satellites for facilitating surveillance and communications; design and construction of logistics support structures; solar panel energy power generation; international cooperation in space activities through global sourcing processes and other such space-influenced initiatives. Today as Turkey embarks on the procurement and contracting with satellite manufacturers for the oversight of the building and launching of its first military/defense satellite "priority program" for communications and surveillance operations, there is the recognition that an opportunity may exist for university students to become familiar with important methodological processes dealing with the acquisition by Turkey of certain aeronautical and space technologies - the bases of which can include a look at such applications and their connection to security needs within logistics and supply chain managemen- t activities. With this relatively late focus on Turkey\´s expansion into space, there may exist an opportunity to capture further the students\´ imagination into another dimension - that of the exploration of space as a source of tools for dealing with security issues. Recognition of this opportunity may be the initial step toward the inclusion of these issues into the development of the university course offering. Such a course would serve as a tool for teaching/training students to become familiar with the methodology for the appreciation of the global impact of space technologies as part of the logistics and supply chain program of study. It may further allow the student to gain insight about such programs and also may help to create more robust discussion and innovative thinking about development of the logistics and supply chain infrastructure. Such educated and trained students, during the course of their chosen career fields, may contribute by their seeking to be included in the planning sessions for collaboration on the security aspects of related projects - the objective being to find new ways to strategize Turkey\´s participation in the various logistics and supply chain management programs and thereby maximize returns to the country.

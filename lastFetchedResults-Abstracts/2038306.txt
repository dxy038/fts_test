In production systems, line balancing is carried out once at begeaning of line construction. In this situation, any change in market needs a new design of assembly line to meet market requirements. However this new design needs a lot of cost. Hence, a new type of assembly line balancing is proposed in this research in which a current assembly line is working. In this situation, a new cycle time is required due to some changes in market settings.  Therefore, a multi-objective model titled assembly line re-balancing problem is proposed whose aim is to schedule tasks in such a way that new cycle time is realized via minimum changes in current assembly line. Moreover, work stationsâ€™ non-smoothness is considered as a relatively new measure. After modeling the problem, an efficient differential evolution algorithm was suggested to solve the problem.

The objective of this work is to develop a system for safe planning and execution of neurosurgery. The system under construction consists of a virtual model of the human brain, interfaced to a force-reflecting probe-guide insertion device. With such a system, neurosurgeons can plan safe paths for inserting biopsy needles and other surgical tools while avoiding possible rupture of blood vessels during the surgery. The operational principle as well as the design of the force and visual feedback system are presented in this paper

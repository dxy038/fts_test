The objective of this research is to develop a case-based reasoning system (CBRS) to assist engineers in designing the forging processes and dies. Forging products are important parts for automotives and other machinery. However, the designs of forging processes and dies to manufacture forging parts are great challenges for engineers. Although there are some CAE tools, such as DEFORM 3D, can be for simulation before the real tools being made, the usage these CAE tools still pose a challenge for engineers. Case-based reasoning system will provide assistance to the design engineers to retrieve the past successful simulation cases. This paper utilizes the CBR tool, my CBR, to construct a case-based reasoning system. myCBR is built upon the ontology tool: Protege. The cases are organized in an object-oriented way, which is inherited from Protege, for easy organization of the existing cases. Each class would have its attributes stored in the corresponding frame. Users can easily retrieve the most closed case by selecting the proper class from the menu then specified the corresponding values in the frame. A pilot implementation will show the process of the simulation case retrieval.

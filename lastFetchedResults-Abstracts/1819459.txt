Objective
fect of age on alveolar bone turnover adjacent to maxillary molar roots of male rats was assessed histomorphometrically with special focus on bone formation and resorption.

l of 110 male Wistar rats ranging in age from 6 to 100 weeks were used for this study. Histomorphometric parameters were measured in fluorescence-labeled undecalcified ground and paraffin-embedded decalcified sections of the alveolar wall around the disto-lingual roots of the maxillary first molars. Bone formation was measured statically by determining the percentage of the bone surface that was double-labeled surface (dLS/BS), bone formation rate (BFR/BS), and mineral apposition rate (MAR). Bone resorption was quantified statically in terms of the number of osteoclasts (N.Oc/BS) and the percentage of the bone surface covered with osteoclasts (Oc.S/BS).
s
e total surface of the alveolar wall, the values obtained for all parameters of both bone formation and resorption decreased with advancing age. All these values rapidly decreased during the early part of the life span, from 6 to 30â€“40 weeks of age, of the rats. A site-specific difference between the distal and mesial sides of the alveolar wall was found for each age group. dLS/BS and BFR/BS were significantly greater (p &lt; 0.0001) on the mesial side than on the distal one. On the other hand, the distal side showed significantly greater (p &lt; 0.0001) value for N.Oc/BS and Oc.S/BS did the mesial one. However, there were no significant age-related changes in dLS/BS and BFR/BS on the distal side or in N.Oc/BS and Oc.S/BS on the mesial side throughout observation period.
sion
sults of the present study demonstrate that alveolar bone turnover of male rats decreased rapidly with advancing age but that in order to maintain the integrity of the tooth function mechanical stress may still have participated in bone formation and resorption of the alveolar wall even in rats 100-week old.

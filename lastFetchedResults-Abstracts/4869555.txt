We describe in this paper the use of type-2 fuzzy logic for achieving adaptive noise cancellation. The objective of adaptive noise cancellation is to filter out an interference component by identifying a model between a measurable noise source and the corresponding un-measurable interference. We propose the use of type-2 fuzzy logic to find this model. The use of type-2 fuzzy logic is justified due to the high level of uncertainty of the process, which makes difficult to find appropriate parameter values for the membership functions.

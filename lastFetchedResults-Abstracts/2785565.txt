In the proposed study, a novel compact and wide-band M-shaped microstrip patch antenna operating in X band of microwave frequency is presented. The main objective of this work is to enhance impedance and pattern bandwidth, polarization purity and gain, essential for RF imaging radars applications. A comprehensive parametric study is carried out to understand the effects of M-shaped patch antenna and to optimize the performance of the final design using 3D electromagnetic High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS ver. 12). The Proposed design is validated through various experiments done in the laboratory.

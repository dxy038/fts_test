In this paper, we present an evaluation of learning algorithms of a novel rule evaluation support method for postprocessing of mined results with rule evaluation models based on objective indices. Post-processing of mined results is one of the key processes in a data mining process. However, it is difficult for human experts to completely evaluate several thousands of rules from a large dataset with noises. To reduce the costs in such rule evaluation task, we have developed the rule evaluation support method with rule evaluation models, which learn from objective indices for mined classification rules and evaluations by a human expert for each rule. To enhance adaptability of rule evaluation models, we introduced a constructive meta-learning system to choose proper learning algorithms. Then, we have done the case study on the meningitis data mining as an actual problem.

A metamaterial spacer composed of spiral resonators (SRs) and narrow metal strips has been tested to operate like a bidirectional artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) reflector at 2.45 GHz. The performance of the spacer has also been evaluated in a closely spaced multiple-antenna system applied to successfully increase the transmission capacity of a commercial wireless IEEE 802.11b router.

Wireless communications need radio frequency links. Radio frequency spectrum is a limited and expensive resource. To help protect the privacy of frequency users and improve efficiency of radio frequency spectrum, we propose a new topic in Spectrum Engineering. Spectrum engineering is the technical skill to solve problems in spectrum management and includes private frequency licensing, Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC), radio regulation, and spectrum planning. In this presentation fundamental of spectrum engineering with a focus on user side and privacy of channel will be covered and considered as an objective of study in courses, such as communications systems and wireless communications.

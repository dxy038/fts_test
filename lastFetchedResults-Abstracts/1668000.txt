In this work a novel reactor configuration has been proposed for simultaneous methanol synthesis, cyclohexane dehydrogenation and hydrogen production. This reactor configuration is a membrane thermally coupled reactor which is composed of three sides for methanol synthesis, cyclohexane dehydrogenation and hydrogen production. Methanol synthesis takes place in the exothermic side that supplies the necessary heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation of cyclohexane reaction. Selective permeation of hydrogen through the Pd/Ag membrane is achieved by co-current flow of sweep gas through the permeation side. A steady-state heterogeneous model of the two fixed beds predicts the performance of this configuration. A theoretical investigation has been performed in order to evaluate the optimal operating conditions and enhancement of methanol, benzene and hydrogen production in a membrane thermally coupled reactor. The co-current mode is investigated and the optimization results are compared with corresponding predictions for a conventional (industrial) methanol fixed bed reactor operated at the same feed conditions. The differential evolution (DE), an exceptionally simple evolution strategy, is applied to optimize this reactor considering the mole fractions of methanol, benzene and hydrogen in permeation side as the main objectives. The simulation results have been shown that there are optimum values of initial molar flow rate of exothermic and endothermic stream, inlet temperature of exothermic, endothermic and permeation sides, and inlet pressure of exothermic side to maximize the objective function. The simulation results show that the methanol mole fraction in output of reactor is increased by 16.3% and hydrogen recovery in permeation side is 2.71 yields. The results suggest that optimal coupling of these reactions could be feasible and beneficial. Experimental proof-of-concept is needed to establish the validity and safe operation of the novel reactor.

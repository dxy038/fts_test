The proposed control objective is achieved by a voltage positive-feedback loop properly designed in the synchronous <i>d</i>-<i>q</i> frame. In this paper, the overall power flow control scheme of the studied DG is first described. Then, a quantitative design methodology of an adaptive voltage-shift acceleration gain based on small-signal stability and step- input response is developed. The proposed control approach is intended to achieve reliable detection with quasi-zero nondetection zone, noncompromised power quality, and easy implementation without additional sensing devices or equipment. Performances on constant-power and constant-current control modes are investigated. Both simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed anti-islanding scheme and the gain design approach.

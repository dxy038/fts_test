The design of an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEG) plant requires oceanographic measurements at the specific site to a fine level of detail over a time interval and with a frequency sufficient to assure optimum configuration and performance. A part of the design process is continuous evaluation of the oceanic data and matching it to the needs of design, construction and test. Of the great quantities of oceanographic data available at likely OTEG sites, little was acquired with the objective of an OTEC plant. A structure of such large size, mass and involving such large mooring loads and large amounts of fluid flow is without precedent. Consequently, some data is of direct applicability, some needs interpretation, some may have insufficient accuracy or resolution and additional measurements may be required. A program is underway to assess available ocean data, to design a plan and schedule to match ocean data to design, construction and test, to match existing data to this plan and to recommend a program of additional measurements.

In this letter, a joint design of cooperative beamforming (CB) and artificial noise (AN) is proposed for two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) relay networks to improve the security of the date exchange. Based on secrecy sum rate maximization (SSRM) criterion, such joint design problem under individual relay power constraints is mathematically hard due to the non-convex objective function. By utilizing the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm, we efficiently develop a stationary point for the original SSRM design problem. Proof is also given to show that SDR is always tight and yields a rank-one solution. Simulations are presented to validate the efficiency and merits of our proposed joint CB and AN design in enhancing the secrecy sum rate.

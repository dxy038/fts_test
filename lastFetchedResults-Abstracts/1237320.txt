BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Determination of block level in patients with heart block is particularly importance and traditionally in the treatment and diagnostic centers, invasive electrophysiology is used. In this study, we aimed to study accuracy of electrocardiography for non-invasive determination of atrio-ventricular block levels in patients need to temporary pacemaker.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 60 patients with heart block were candidate for temporary pacemaker in according to ECG findings, EPS study was also done. Level of the block was estimated with ECG and compared with EPS findings, and relation and agreement were analyzed. 
FINDINGS: From 60 patients, 31 patients (51.7%) were women. Mean age of patients was 69.7Â±9.1 years old. In ECG findings, 13 patients (21.7%) had 2:1 AV block, 12 patients (20%) had second degree AV block, 35 patients (58.3%) had third degree AV block. In ECG findings, level of AV block in 10 patients (16.7%) was AV nodal and in 50 patients (83.3%) was infra nodal. In EPS findings level of AV block in 11 patients (18.3%) was AV nodal and in 49 patients (81.7%) was infra nodal. Estimation of AV block level in ECG findings in comparison with EPS findings had 93.9% sensitivity, 63.6% specificity, 92% positive predictive value,70% negative predictive value and 88.3% accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Electrocardiographic findings have high accuracy in noninvasive estimation of heart block levels. So, when invasive procedures faced with the constraints, may be beneficial.

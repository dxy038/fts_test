Introduction & Objective: Subjective Well-being is one of the important indicators for the evaluation of mental health status and screening   mental health problems in general population including university students is necessary. So, this study was carried out in order to assess subjective well-being and its related factors in the students of KNMF, in 2008.
Materials & Methods: In this cross- sectional study, 161 students were selected through random stratified method. Data was collected by Q-LES-QSF and a questionnaire which was about possible related factors to subjective well-being. Subjective well-being status was determined in a scale of 0-100; and its limits were calculated with %95 confidence. The data was analyzed using Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-wallis test and stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis. 
Results: Q-LES-QSF score was 57/04 ± 19/17 (%95 CLM = 54/07-60/01). There was a significant relationship between the students’ interest in the major of study and subjective well-being (p < 0/006). In this study, the effect of disease suffering on subjective well-being was also confirmed (p=0.000). Regression analysis showed that %44/1 of the observed variance in the status of subjective well-being  had been determined by 3 variables of disease suffering, interest in the major of study, and the semester number (F=29/153, p=0.000)  while  disease suffering explains %34 of the total variance alone.
Conclusion: Subjective well-being level in the students of KNMF is low. Introducing the majors of study to the students before entering to the university and further notice to their mental & physical health especially in the first years of education seems to improve their subjective well-being.

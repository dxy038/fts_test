The objective of the Holistic Corner Control (HCC) is to keep the vehicle on a target path by minimizing the error between the actual and target center of gravity (CG) forces and moment. A real time optimization procedure has been proposed in order to calculate the necessary tire force adjustments to minimize the error and to give the driver a normal driving feel even though the road conditions differ from what is perceived. In this paper, we extend the HCC methodology by adding constraints to the optimization problem. Some important applications are (1) differential braking on all wheels (AWD), applicable to both electrically driven wheels or conventional cars; and (2) hybrid torque vectoring on front wheels (FWD) and differential braking on the rear wheels. Performance of the constrained HCC is compared against the HCC optimization using both simulation and experimental results.

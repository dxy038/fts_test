Work breakdown structures are the base for project management. The quality of work breakdown structures of automobile R&amp;D project directly affects the control of the process of automobile new product development in time, cost, scope, quality and other aspects. In order to improve the quality of work breakdown structures, the paper introduces Plan-Do-Check-Action cycle and develops a distinct process model by integrating the objective management and process management. The model contains four key indicators, such as scope, awareness, responsibility and risk, to evaluate the quality of work breakdown structures in the process. The paper also presents specific tools and methods to the implementation of the model with example.

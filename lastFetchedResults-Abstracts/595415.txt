Objective: To identify factors affecting medical specialty preferences and associated gender differences in Fourth Year MBBS students. Material and Methods: This was a Cross-sectional survey conducted on fourth year MBBS students of Lahore Medical and Dental College through a Preformed Structured questionnaire by non probability sampling technique. The student were told that the survey was voluntary and were given a choice of refusal but fortunately all the students in the class participated in the survey (n=120). Data was collected during January 2009. Data was analyzed using SPSS v 16.0. Descriptive statistics were computed, and the relationship between specialty preference and categorical variables (gender, reasons for choosing a particular specialty) were evaluated using Pearson Chi square test. A calculated p value of <_0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Our study revealed that students selected surgery [40(33%)] as the most preferred post graduate specialty followed by medicine [17(14%)] and Obstetrics/Gynecology [16(13%)] respectively. Female medical students picked Obstetrics /Gynecology [16(24%)] while male medical students opted for Surgery as their most preferred specialty [28 (51%)]. This gender difference in specialty preference was statistically significant with a p value of < 0.00. The most common reasons for choosing a particular specialty were reputation (general perception among people) of the specialty [46(38%)] and anticipated income [22(18%)]. Conclusion: The most common reasons cited by students for choosing a particular specialty was reputation of the specialty followed by anticipated income and advice from parents. Gender differences were found in career preferences.

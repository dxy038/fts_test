Objective: The aims of the study were to evaluate differences in dietary, oral hygiene habits and social class among children with Type I diabetes mellitus (DM), and non-diabetic children and to investigate the relationship between selected caries risk factors and DMF status among these groups. This study was under taken in Ahvaz, Iran . 
Subjects and Methods: Thirty one children with type I DM with a mean age of 11±2.34 years and 31 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic controls were included in the study. Metabolic control of diabetes was categorized into well, moderate and poorly controlled groups based on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).  The data collection was based on physical examination and a completed questionnaire which included information on dietary and oral hygiene habits, social class and DMF. The data were statistically analyzed using McNemara and student t-tests and level of significant was considered with P<0/05. 
Results: Results showed that the diabetic children had less frequent cariogenic snacking intake than their controls. The mean number nutrition index was 7.65±3.27for diabetic and 11.9±2.03 in the controls. There was no significant difference DMF between diabetic and controls (3.71±2.48 for diabetics and 4.35±2.74 in the controls). There were no difference according to the frequency of tooth brushing and use of mouth washes, but significantly more diabetics reported that they never used dental floss than non-diabetics. 
Conclusion: Frequent consumption of cariogenic snacks can influence caries development in children. Amongst the diabetics, the difference in caries prevalence can be explained by combination of biological and behavioral factors rather than single dietary or oral hygiene elements.

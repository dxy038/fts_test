BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Sympathectomy has been presented as one of the treatment for lower limb ischemia. This procedure decreases the pain in disease that vessels have been narrowed. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of sympathectomy on ischemia of limbs and factors on outcome of buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans).
METHODS: This cross sectional study was performed on 31 patients from 1998 to 2003 who undergone sympathectomy for buerger's disease. In this study age, sex, duration of the disease, results of pathology, sensory dysfunction symptoms, pain, dermal temperature and sore were investigated. Data was analyzed by explanatory indices and statistical tests and difference with p<0.05 was considered significant.
FINDINGS, Mean age of the patients was 48.5Â± 16.7. 94.1% of the patients were male and 82,6% were smokers. In patients with positive pathology, improvement of pain, coldness and sense was significantly better than negative pathologic patients (p<O.OI, p=0.016 and p<0.05, respectively) but the repair of wound wasn't significantly different between these two groups. Incidence of limb loss was significantly more in smoker patients.
CONCLUSION: According to the obtained results, it could be suggested sympathectomy as a treatment of buerger's disease and the sooner one quit smoking due to the less incidence of limb loss.

This paper presents a completelydynamic mixed-integer model to solve the optimal sizing, timing, and location of distribution substation and feeder expansion problems simultaneously. The objective function of the model represents the present worth of costs of investment, energy, and demand losses of the system which takes place throughout the planning time horizon. It is minimized subject to the KirchhoffÂ´s current law, power capacity limits, and logical constraints by using a standard mathematical programming system. The developed model allows to include the explicit constraints of radiality and voltage drop in its formulation.

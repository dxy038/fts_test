An object-oriented macro dataflow system called Mentat is described. The objective of Mentat is to provide an easy-to-use, transparent mechanism to exploit parallelism. Mentat meets these objectives by combining a data-driven computation model, the macro data-flow model, with the object-oriented programming paradigm. A high-level view of Mentat (including the macro data-flow model) is provided, along with MentatÂ´s graph-representation mechanism called future lists, the Mentat programming language, the Mentat virtual machine, and the implementation status of a prototype Mentat system

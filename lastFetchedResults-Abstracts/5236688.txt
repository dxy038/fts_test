Sizing by optimization usually implies a model definition able to link the desired objective and constrained functions with the design parameters. When gradient based optimization algorithms are used, highly accurate derivatives are required. Without special software solutions, this procedure easily becomes time-consuming or error-prone. In this paper, our goal is to first observe the modeling needs of electromagnetic devices in the optimization context. A new modeling language is then proposed in order to satisfy and formalize these needs. The concepts are validated by the modeling and optimization procedures of an electromagnetic actuator.

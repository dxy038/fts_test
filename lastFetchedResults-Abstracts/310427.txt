Objective. To describe the effects of age and gender on three-dimensional (3D) active cervical spine motion.

Design. This was a descriptive study. Background. This study expanded on previous investigations of age and gender effects on single plane motion of the cervical spine.

Methods. Sixty female and 60 male asymptomatic, normal volunteers, aged between 20 and 59 years, were examined in a standardized seated position. The 3 space Isotrak system was used to measure simultaneous 3D motion of the cervical spine.

Results. The mean range of all the primary movements decreased significantly with age. For flexion/extension the greatest decrease occurred between the 20- and 30-year-olds, whereas for both lateral flexion and rotation, significant differences were demonstrated in subjects aged two decades apart. The coupling of motion associated with rotation was significantly related to age.

Conclusion. Age had a significant effect on all of the primary movements. Age had less effect on the range of the coupled movements, in that the only movements to be affected were lateral flexion and extension occurring during cervical rotation. Gender had no marked effect on the primary or the coupled movements.

Ontology is recently one of the hot issues in research community. Domain specific Ontologies are being utilized as a search engine on the web page with an objective to make searching on the web page substantially more efficient, especially when it is more important to find the right web page, than searching with usual keywords. Ontology can play a very important role in the process of creating as well as managing the knowledge. This paper addresses the important issues in developing domain specific ontology for agriculture domain. We propose a generic approach for agriculture domain ontology representing entities and their relationships. We have developed a small ontology using the suggested approach. Our work is significant as we have not found any significant work targeting ontology development in agriculture domain.

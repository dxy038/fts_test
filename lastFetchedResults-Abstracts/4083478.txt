An approach for the segmentation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images is discussed. The method integrates the gamma distribution in an objective function that exploits a discontinuity-adaptive Markov random field (DA-MRF) model that allows the user to determine the degree of homogeneity of the results according to the nature of the phenomena of interest. Both visual and numerical results illustrate its potential

Nail-shaped bidirectional soil-cement mixing pile, as a new foundation reinforcement technology, has been successfully applied in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other places. The application of nail-shaped cement soil bidirectional mixing pile in the construction of the Huangshansi Drainage Pumping Station is the first attempt of this process in the water conservancy projects in our province. Through analysis of geological exploration data, it is determined that the process of nail-shaped bidirectional soil-cement mixing pile is used to reinforce the foundations of intake gate, retaining walls at both sides of fore bay, sink tank, water culvert, flare wall, etc of this pumping station. The composite foundation bearing capacity calculations, settlement calculations and filed mixing core sampling intensity tests and analysis have shown that this design is rational. As this process is technically advanced and economically rational, the authors advise to promote the use of this process in other similar projects.

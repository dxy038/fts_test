This paper investigates the one-machine sequencing problem in a workshop where the machine has to
satisfy the no-idle constraint, that is, the machine must process jobs without interruption. The objective
is to minimize the makespan. Each job has a release date for which it is available for processing on the
machine and a delivery time during which it must remain in the system after being processed by the
machine. This problem has been studied without adding the no-idle constraint. It is solved in polynomial
time, when the preemption of jobs is allowed, applying Jackson’s rule. But, when the preemption of jobs is
not allowed, it becomes strongly NP-hard. Although, it can be solved in a very short time using Carlier’s
branch and bound algorithm. Below, we propose to adapt Carlier’s branch and bound method in order to
calculate an optimal nonpreemptive schedule for the problem when adding the no-idle constraint.

The main objective of this paper is to broaden the lock range of the Digital Tanlock Loop (DTL) by extending the stable behaviour of the loop to larger control parameter by incorporating a feedback loop. The tendency of the DTL to diverge is measured and fed back as a form of linear stabilization. Using this technique the loop lock range is extended. The lock range extension has been confirmed through the use of bifurcation diagram , and Lyapunov exponent.

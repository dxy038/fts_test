Brangus steers (n = 247) finished on pasture were used to evaluate the effects of post-mortem ageing and polymorphism CAPN1 316 and CAPN1 4751 markers on meat tenderness and objective colour measurements (CIEL*a*b*) of m. Longissimus dorsi. Ageing meat for 7 days decreased shear force (SF) by 13.7% and improved a* (8.4%) and b* (10%) compared to ageing for 1 day. No difference between 7 and 14 days of ageing was found for SF, a* and b*. However, L* increased markedly with ageing. Fitting both markers simultaneously, CAPN1 316 showed association with SF and L* and CAPN1 4751 with a* and b*. Fitting the markers individually, CAPN1 4751 affected all traits and CAPN1 316 showed association with SF and L*. Post-mortem ageing and the use of markers represent two independent and alternative tools that could be used for improving quality of meat from Brangus cattle.

Location Based Services (LBS) contribute many benefits for mobile users to retrieve the precise information about the location at right time with personalized setup. Generally LBS are used to create desktop applications through which a user can get information regarding their location. The disadvantage in the existing system does not help the user to find the exact location on their move. LBS are an Information Service, which is accessible from mobile devices through the mobile network and provides information based on the geographical position of the device. LBS include services to identify a location of a person or an object or a service such as discovering the nearest facilities as per the userÂ´s preferences. The information on health care services is essential and vital. There is a significant requirement of efficient and user friendly location based services which provide health care related information like location and details of hospitals for a user on the move. The proposed methodology for finding the nearest Healthcare Facilities in a city is based on the network analysis which is used to determine the closeness and the shortest path to the healthcare facilities using the ArcGIS software. This approach uses a new shortest path algorithm called the Bidirectional algorithm.

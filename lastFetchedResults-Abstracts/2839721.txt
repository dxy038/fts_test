In this paper, a novel concept of multi-link failure isolation is proposed on all-optical networks (AONs). In our study, the basis of fault diagnosis, which is supported by link management protocol (LMP), is introduced for rapid deployment on GMPLS networks. Yet, the LMP is incapable to detect multi-link failure on the same light path, thus, adding the addition of probing path is an efficient strategy for solving its insufficient fault diagnostic capability. To implement this strategy and make our mechanism feasible in reality, an addition method of active probes is developed for AONs which are equipped with LMP (link management protocol) and backup path establishment. With the aids of established light paths/backup paths, engineered additional probes and LMP, our mechanism gathers much more information for fault diagnosis than any other ones do to achieve k-fault diagnostic capability. Besides, our study provides a resilient method for resetting (adjustable) k-fault diagnostic capability without recalculating the whole system. Also, the issue of cost-effective is also in our concern. The experimental results are compared with those of the m-cycle, fault inference with healthy information (FIHI), optimal and our mechanisms. The performance reveals that our proposed mechanism can reach our objective.

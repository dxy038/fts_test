Background: Neonatal period is one of the most important periods in human's life. Low birth weight and immaturity is often the cause of death, (weiqht less tham l000grm and pregnancy less than 30 weeks). One of the main cause of death in this period is respiratory distress syndrome. Objective: To determine the effect of prone and supine positioning oxygenation in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.
Design: This was a cross over study, we assessed and compared oxygenation and episodes of hypoxemia in infants with respiratory distress syndrome in the supine versus prone position for 45 minutes time intervals.
Sample: 60 preterm neonate with birth weight < 2500 gm were selected by sequential sampling. Result: The findings indicate a significant difference between prone and supine positioning. Prone positioning increased oxygen saturation from 94/99% (in supine position) to 96/29(P<0.0001) and decreased episodes of hypoxemia. Conclusion: Our findings support prone positioning for the premature infant with respiratory distress syndrome in an intensive care setting.

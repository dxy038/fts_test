We present an adaptive membrane lens that is compatible with a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging system, as a part of an objective for in-bore optical motion tracking and correction. Compatibility tests with the high magnetic fields of a 3 T scanner and the shielding of the adaptive lens are discussed. For tracking of a marker an adaptive wide-angle objective has been designed and characterised. The measured mean distortions of the objective are between -2.05 and -2.6 %. The tracking system was verified in a MR scanner model.

In this paper, the fault tolerant system for BLDC motors has been proposed to maintain the control performance under switching device faults of inverter. The proposed fault tolerant system provides compensation for open-circuit faults and short-circuit faults in power converter. The fault identification is quickly achieved by simple algorithm using the characteristic of BLDC motor drives. The drive system after fault identification is reconfigured by the four-switch topology connecting a faulty leg to the middle point of DC-link using bidirectional switches. The feasibility of the proposed fault tolerant system is proved by simulation

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of frying temperature,  time and different batter formulations on the rheological properties and mass transfer during deep fat frying of Kurdish cheese nuggets. The effects of white egg (0, 5, 10%) addition to the batter formulation of cheese nuggets and frying at 150, 170 and 190?C for 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 min have been investigated. The results showed an interaction effect of these processing conditions on mass transfer. The most reduction in fat absorption was observed when samples were coated with batter containing 10% white egg and fried at 150 ?C. The kinetic model based on the Fick’s law was used to describe moisture transfer data. The effective moisture diffusivity of batter without white egg was within the range of 3.97×10?8 and 7.51×10?8m2/s with R2 between 0.91 and 0.86 .In the samples coated with the batter  including white egg, the effective diffusivity ranged between 2.26×10?8 and 5.96×10?8m2/s with R2 between 0.98 and 0.87, and fat transfer rate constant was between 1.1×10?3 and 8.9×10?3 s?1 with R2 from 0.82 to 0.99. Activation energy obtained from the Arrhenius plot for the effective moisture diffusivity of batter with and without white egg was 30.01 kJ/mol and ranged from 38.42 to 36.52 kJ/mol, respectively.

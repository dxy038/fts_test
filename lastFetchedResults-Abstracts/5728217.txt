Scheduling number of jobs in a single machine is a &#8220;Uni-machine job scheduling problem&#8221;. The mean of variation of jobÂ´s waiting time is called Waiting time Variance (WTV). Minimization of WTV directly improves the quality of service (QoS) of systems involved with job scheduling. WTV minimization is a NP-hard problem. As a matter of fact minimization of the WTV on computer networks can lead to stable and predictable network performance. The main objective of this paper is to provide a secure and predictable computer and network systems by proposing a heuristic based novel approach to minimize the WTV. This approach illustrated with small size problems along with randomly new generated problems. The experimental results are compared with existing approaches. The experimental result shows the proposed approach gives best performance for the compared approaches and problems tested. The findings of intended algorithm are shown in the form of table for consonant problems.

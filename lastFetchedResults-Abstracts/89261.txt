We enhance the general shuffle-exchange network (GSEN) with bidirectional links. For bidirectional links, the bidirectional GSEN can be divided into two dependent networks, forward network and backward network. Based on the idea of inversely using the forward tag, we propose a tag-based routing algorithm for the backward network, so as to reduce the computation of the shuffle-exchange operation

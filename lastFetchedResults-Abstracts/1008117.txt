Progressive failure of unidirectional glass fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRP) was studied using finite element analysis in orthogonal machining. Chip formation process and damage modes such as matrix cracking, fiberâ€“matrix debonding and fiber breaking were modelled by degrading the material properties. Damage analysis was carried out using Hashin, Maximum stress and Hoffman failure criteria. After damage was detected, selective stiffness degradation was applied to the workpiece material. The objective of this study is to better understand the chip formation process and to analyse the cutting-induced damage from initiation stage until complete chip formation. The effect of the fiber orientation on cutting forces and sub-surface damage was investigated with different failure criteria. The results were addressed in terms of cutting forces evolution and damage progression in the composite structure during machining. It was demonstrated that the use of the stiffness degradation concept with the appropriate failure criterion responds potentially in a predictable fashion to changes in chip formation process for machining of FRPs.

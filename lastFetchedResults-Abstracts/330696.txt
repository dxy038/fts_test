Objective. To investigate the variation of the strength of gypsum-bonded dental investments with burnout temperature.

Methods. The disc-rupture test was employed at burnout temperatures ranging from 450 to 800 Â°C for four products (Beauty Cast, Cristobalite, Novocast (all WhipMix) and Deguvest California (Degussa)). In this test, an investment disc is created inside an investment mold such that it forms a diaphragm across the mold space, being an integral part of the mold. Copper was cast into molds of this type, and whether the disc had ruptured or not was determined by inspection when cold. The amount of copper cast in successive tests was varied in staircase fashion up and down depending on whether the disc survived or failed. The strength of the investment was represented by the 50% point of the transition from survival to rupture.

Results. The strength of gypsum-bonded investment is temperature sensitive, there being marked differences between the products tested. Overall, the strength ranking (temperature range average/MPa) was: Cristobalite (10.1)>Beauty Cast (7.8)>Novocast (5.1)>Deguvest California (3.4). The strength ranking at high temperatures differs from that known for the room temperature values.

Significance. The use by manufacturers of room-temperature strength data conveys no information about high temperature behavior. Investment properties should be optimized by reference to behavior under casting conditions.

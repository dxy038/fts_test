Telecommunication companies offer customers new home services which requires new physical mediums of transmission, but the addition of wires is not a desirable solution. Last years, new technologies have been developed in order to solve this problem of signal distribution, like home-plug and home-rf. This work presents a communication system based on PLC using the free C band between 100 kHz and 500 kHz. Its main objective is the implementation of a low-cost full-digital modem using advanced digital technology capable of support voice and data communications, and QoS assured. In this work we present the co-simulation design process using software tools like System Generator, Simulink, and ISE, and a hardware evaluation board.

The GEOSS Common Infrastructure (GCI) provides a Clearinghouse (the GEOSS registry and metadata catalogue) and a GEOPortal to discover and visualize EO data in an integrated, standardized and interactive way, as well as broadly use it by the scientific community when dealing with representation and modeling of Earth Systems. EO data sources are ideally elaborated following quality assessment procedures, resulting in quality estimates and other related indicators. The objective of this indicators is to allow users deciding about data fitness for a purpose, but in practice systems providing methods to distribute, show and exploit this producer quality information in a standard and interoperable way are rarely used. This work aims to extract information about data quality from GCI metadata and analyze the obtained results. Additionally, an XML specific tool is able to quick and visually punctuating the metadata that refers to quality.

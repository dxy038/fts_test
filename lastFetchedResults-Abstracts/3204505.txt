Due to increasing of the wind power penetration in power systems, centralized control for a wind farm is needed to connect to the grid. This paper describes an optimal unit commitment problem, which is a part of wind farm centralized control that schedules the wind turbines of wind farm to satisfy the demand power from transmission system operator. Four binary variables are introduced to formulate a new objective function which is to minimize the sum of expected production cost, the expected cost of unserved energy, start-up and shut-down cost of each turbine. Different scenarios are illustrated in the illustrative example, which is consisting of 10 wind turbines, by using the proposed method. Simulation results show that adjusting the coefficients in the objective function can schedule the commitment of wind turbines according to the transmission system operator.

Background. Our objective was to evaluate survival trends (1984–1995), the prevalence of AIDS-defining conditions, and the role of treatment with zidovudine and/or prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in survival following AIDS diagnosis.

s. We reviewed the clinical charts and postmortem studies of all patients admitted to the HIV Clinic from 1984–1995. Three groups were identified according to the following dates of HIV diagnosis: 1) 1984–1988; 2) 1989–1992, and 3) 1993–1995.

s. We studied 909 charts. During the study period, 744 (81.6%) patients developed AIDS. Median survival increased from 11.7 months in group 1 to 15.4 and 17.5 months in groups 2 and 3, respectively (p &lt;0.05). We observed the following important changes in the frequency of AIDS-defining conditions over the study period: Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) decreased from 24.8 to 17 and 14% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, (p = 0.008), and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), from 31.1 to 10.5 and 13.5% (p &lt;0.001). On the other hand, there was an increase in cytomegalovirus disease with 12.4, 20.4, and 18.6% (p = 0.04) and wasting syndrome with 36, 45, and 57% (p &lt;0.001). In the proportional hazard model for death, zidovudine or TMP-SMX use was associated with a protective effect.

sions. Survival is improving among patients with HIV infection at our institution. The prevalence of AIDS-defining conditions has changed over the last 12 years. There has been a diminution of PCP and KS, whereas cases of CMV disease and wasting syndrome increased.

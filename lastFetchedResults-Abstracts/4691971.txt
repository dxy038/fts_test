This paper presents a new method and tool for estimating and solving for the state of a nonlinear AC power system directly and non-iteratively. It is based on the re-linearization technique. This method is direct since it does not utilize the traditional Least-Squares objective function and its derivatives. It is non-iterative and does not depend on an initial guess. The method has been applied to various formulations of the power system equations. The method has only been applied to small power systems up to about 150 buses and very preliminary results are presented here. The method is geared toward higher quality measurements such as synchrophasors obtained using PMUs and may require a subset of sufficiently accurate or error-free measurements in some cases. With additional testing and further commercial grade software development is it hoped that this new method can improve both the robustness and the speed of solving for the state of power systems in the future.

Over the last few decades the competitive advantage of business organizations and their profitability have been linked to effective resources management. In a rapidly evolving economy, the responsiveness necessary to compete is increasing and the challenge facing organizations is to focus on the individual (whether a customer, a supplier, or an internal resource) to design competitive strategies. This paper proposes intelligent models of individual behaviour to support effective resource allocation strategies within a business environment. The context for application and demonstration of this research is a London-based investment bank and the focus of the study is on the performance of their liquid bond trading desk. The objective of the study is to improve the portfolio profitability of the trading desk by improving team performance.

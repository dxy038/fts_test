Increasing numbers of companies in the manufacturing industry have identified market potential for implementing sustainable and green manufacturing. Yet, current sustainability assessment tools for companies are complicated, requiring vast amounts of data and technical expertise to use them. Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is founded on lean practices, and it uses a simple method to analyze various types of material, energy, and information flow needed to bring products and services to the end-customer. The objective of this paper is to introduce and illustrate the application of a VSM-based assessment, termed as Sustainable Manufacturing Mapping (SMM). SMM takes chosen sustainability indicators into consideration and is based on VSM, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Discrete Event Simulation (DES). The main phases of SMM include goal definition, identification of the sustainability indicators, and modeling the current and future state process maps. In this paper, some example indicators were identified and an SMM process map was generated for illustrative purposes.

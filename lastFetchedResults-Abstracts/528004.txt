The main objective of this paper is to convert the written multilingual text into machine generated synthetic speech. This paper is proposed in order to provide a complete multilingual speech synthesizer for three lan-guages Indian English, Tamil and Telugu. The main application of TTS system is that it will be helpful for blind and mute people that they could have the text read to them by computer. TTS system will help in re-trieving the information from sites that contain information in different languages. It can be used in educa-tional institutions for pronunciation teaching of different languages. We use concatenative speech synthesis where the segments of recorded speech are concatenated to produce the desired output. We apply prosody which makes the synthesized speech sound more like human speech. Smoothing is also done to smooth the transition between segments in order to produce continuous output. The Optimal Coupling algorithm is en-hanced to improve the performance of speech synthesis system.

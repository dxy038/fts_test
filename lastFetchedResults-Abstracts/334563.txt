In this paper we report three cases of solitary pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma (RCC), treated surgically. Various features and the surgical approach of these metastases are discussed with references to the 33 previous published cases collected in the literature. Having eliminated widespread distant metastases, it is reasonable to restrict surgical resection of the pancreas to selected patients having a single synchronous or metachronous metastasis, or those having several unilateral metastatic foci. At any rate a careful long-term follow-up for patients with a past history of RCC is mandatory.

Lunar mare basalts, highland anorthosites and KREEP are the three major lunar rock types reported from the lunar surface. In the present study, we interpret the reflectance spectral behavior of lunar analog basalts including massive basalt, vesicular basalt and amygdaloidal basalt collected from the Deccan basaltic region, which are considered as equivalent of lunar mare basalts. Reflectance spectra of analog basalts were measured at three different environments: in the field, under controlled field conditions and in the lab. In field conditions the reflectance spectra were measured under 350–1050 nm spectral range. During controlled field and lab condition, reflectance spectra were measured under 350–2500 nm range covering the UV, visible, NIR, and SWIR regions. The spectral characteristics of basalts measured under different environments and their merits and demerits were discussed. However, lab spectra have given clear, reliable diagnostic spectral information for our present objective. The major oxides and minerals of analog basalts were compared with lunar mare basalts. The presence of Ca-pyroxene, ferrous and ferric iron and their diagnostic spectral features in basalts are discussed for study of lunar mare region.

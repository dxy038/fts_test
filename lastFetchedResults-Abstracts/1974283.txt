The objective of this work is to illustrate the possibilities of NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) for characterising gels. As model food systems, carrageenan-gels/solutions and whey protein gels are studied. The water-holding capacity of gels including sol-gel transitions is investigated. Pore systems of gels are characterised by analysed diffusion experiments. Yogurt is used as an example of a complex food, and is treated with a special wash-out-test. This test allows conclusions concerning the trend to syneresis and the structure of the system. It is shown that NMR provides a powerful tool for tackling practice-relevant problems, such as syneresis, sandy mouth-feel or increased yield and to improve or develop appropriate processes.

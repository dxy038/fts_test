This paper reports some of the findings in a project at Loughborough University in the UK. An objective of the work has been to create a band pass square-loop Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) in walls to increase the coverage of certain communication systems. With the increasing use of mobile computing devices such as PDAs, laptops, and the expansion of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), there is growing interest in increasing productivity and efficiency through enhancing received signal power. The FSS is simulated by Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio (MWS). Remcom `Wireless InSiteÂ´ is used to simulate indoor propagation and to predict the performance. The concept has been tested inside half-wave chamber. Significant improvements are shown using an FSS based surface.

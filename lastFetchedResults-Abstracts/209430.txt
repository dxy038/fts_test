Desert in terms of geomorphologic aspects has been defined and classified based on the
morphogenesis, litological structures and combination of these two criteria. In this study
Hormozgan desert has been classified in terms of geomorphologic features using morphometric
method in order to separate the desert area from non desert area. The objective of this work was
to detenn ine the extent of the natural desert of Hormozgarn province using maps of geology,
topography and combination of data collected from geomorphologic features of desert in the
GIS environment. The geomorphologic features such as pediment plains, flooding beds in the
route of water way network , drifted sand, nebkas, playa, saline lands and badlands were
diagnosed . In order to be able to map all items in maps showing Hormozgan desert areas, the
Satellite images from ETM was used to fined the new land features and also correct the
boundary of desert lands. Finally it was found that the geomorphologic desert of Hormozgan
covers % 17/2 of the whole area of the province.

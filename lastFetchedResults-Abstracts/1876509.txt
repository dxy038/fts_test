Objective
tudy determined the effect of urine flow rate on bladder temperature in critically ill adults.

sign was pretest-posttest quasi-experimental.
g
udy took place at a tertiary care center in western Washington.
ts
ience sampling resulted in an intervention group of 35 and a control group of 25 patients who had undergone cardiac surgery.
ention
etic, administered intravenously as part of usual postoperative care, provided variation in the urine flow rate.
s
y bladder temperature (UBT), pulmonary artery temperature (PAT), and urine flow rate data were collected at 2-minute intervals for 60 minutes preintervention and 60 minutes postintervention.
s
 the control group, who experienced no significant change in mean urine flow rate or gradient (0.00째C) from prephase to postphase, the intervention group experienced both a significant and close to 10-fold increase in urine flow rate (P &lt; .001) and a significant decrease (0.09째C) in mean UBT-PAT gradient (P &lt; .001). The change in gradient experienced by the intervention group compared with the control group was the result of a net heat loss of 0.05째C in UBT and a net heat gain of 0.04째C in PAT.
sions
gh statistically significant, the mean change in UBT-PAT gradient between the intervention and control groups was not clinically important, indicating that bladder temperature remains reliable even with significant changes in urine flow rate.

This document presents the formulation of Radio Network Design Problems (RNDPs) and their solutions using three metaheuristic algorithms. A mathematical model is presented: optimization variables, constraints handling, and objective functions for performance maximization and transmit power minimization. Our optimization framework is based on a light computational weight statistical propagation simulator, designed to work for 802.11n indoor WLANs. Solutions to formulated RNDPs are presented using Simulated Annealing, Firefly Algorithm, and Modified Particle Swarm metaheuristics. We provide a comparison between different objective functions and solution algorithms.

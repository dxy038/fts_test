An approach for finding and optimizing two-dimensional (2-D) motor geometries, based on the regularity of 2-D magnetic fields, is reported. In particular, solving optimization problems such as cogging torque minimization and maximization of time-averaged motor torque, the effectiveness of our approach in cutting computational time is verified. The elapsed time to find the optimal solution is less than 1/10 of the time by a conventional approach whose objective function is calculated from the toque waveform.

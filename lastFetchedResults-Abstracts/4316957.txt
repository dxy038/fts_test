Live public viewing of sports and other events are rapidly increasing in popularity. Ultra-high-resolution (4K and 8K) video transmission systems make it possible for the public to experience the full impact of such events. Since 4K video has four times and 8K video has 16 times the resolution of high definition television (HDTV), they can capture the detailed facial expressions of performers than in greater detail than with HDTV. However, no uncompressed 4K/8K video storage or delivery system over IP network is currently available. Moreover, no uncompressed 8K video transmission system is currently available. To address this deficiency, we developed a scalable high-speed video server system to deliver high-quality video, including uncompressed HD and uncompressed 4K video, streams over IP networks and a synchronization method for it that combines multiple 4K transmission systems and video servers. We demonstrated the method´s validity by implementing and testing an uncompressed 8K video real-time transmission system and an uncompressed 8K video on-demand system. Through experiments performed on both systems via commercial 100- Gbit/s Ethernet, we succeeded in achieving the world´s first bidirectional uncompressed 8K video transmission and 8K video on-demand systems.

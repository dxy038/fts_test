The objective evaluation of the factors influencing the performance of the innovation talents is the key to the effective investment into the innovation. Up to now, some methods as survey, experiment, case study, etc. have been used to study the performance of talents. However, most of them are qualitative approaches. So, to raise the objectivity of the study, the paper applies Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchical Process (FAHP) to evaluate the factors influencing the performance of the innovative talents. FAHP is an approach that combines the qualitative and the quantitative skill. By FAHP, the paper has set up the evaluation indicator system of the factors influencing the performance of the innovative talents and the evaluation models of the system. With the deduction of fuzzy consistency, the paper has realized dynamic self-adaptation of the factors influencing the performance of the innovative talents in the evaluation matrix. Finally, the paper proposes the relative weights and the priority sequencing of the factors influencing the performance of the innovative talents by solving the evaluation matrix.

This paper focuses on improving the solution techniques for the AC SCOPF problem of active power dispatch by using the DC SCOPF approximation within the SCOPF algorithm. Our approach brings two benefits compared with benchmark SCOPF algorithms: it speeds up the solution of an iterative AC SCOPF algorithm thanks to a more efficient identification of binding contingencies and allows improving the objective by an appropriate choice of a limited number of corrective actions for each contingency. The proposed approach is illustrated on five test systems of 60, 118, 300, 1203, and 2746 buses.

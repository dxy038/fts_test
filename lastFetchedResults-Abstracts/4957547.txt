In this paper, we study the spectrum access problem in cognitive radio networks with the objective to maximize the expected throughput of cognitive users. We show that the performance of a uniform access policy that uniformly selects one channel to sense, independent of the primary usersÂ´ behaviors on the channels, is close to that of the optimal randomized access policy when there are a large number of contending cognitive users. We also characterize the throughput taking the energy constraint of cognitive users into account, and present a unified PHY/MAC design to improve the throughput.

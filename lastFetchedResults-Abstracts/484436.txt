Objective: This survey research investigates the relationship between pencil grip and some important factors in students with mental retardation. Method: 126 students with mental retardation (53 girls and 73 boys), ranging from 9 to 19 educating in grades 1st to 5th in two exceptional children schools in Shahr-e Rey, were assessed. Those students having anatomical, neurological, orthopedic, behavioral, severe vision and hearing difficulties were already excluded. A handwriting checklist developed by the researchers was administered. Results: Correlation coefficient showed that there exists a significant positive relationship between pencil grip and handwriting (r = 0/381, p < 0/0001). No meaningful relationship was observed between pencil grip and handwriting speed. Also, no meaningful difference was found between right- or left-handed students, between males and female students, between students with and without Down's syndrome. Conclusion: This study stresses on the corrective treatments for pencil grip that may help better handwriting.

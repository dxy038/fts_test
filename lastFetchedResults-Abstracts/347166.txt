Objectives: To evaluate the primitive reflexes by electrophysiological assessments and their correlation with the cognitive and physical functioning of stroke patients.
Methods: Electrophysiological studies of primitive reflexes including jaw jerk, snout reflex, glabellar reflex, and corneomandibular reflexes were performed in 38 stroke patients and 26 normal controls. Cognitive function of patients was assessed by Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) Examination and logical memory test. The Chinese Functional Independence Scale (CFIS) was used to evaluate the physical functioning and social domains of stroke patients.
Results: The presence rate of primitive reflexes was higher in stroke patients than in normal controls. Wave amplitude of snout and corneomandibular reflexes obtained from stroke patients was greater than those from controls. No definite difference in reflex conduction latencies was observed between the two groups. A regression relationship was noted between the wave amplitude of snout reflexes and the 3MS and CFIS scores of stroke patients.
Conclusion: Primitive reflexes can be measured by electrophysiological assessments. The results may serve as an objective and useful parameter in evaluation of cognition and physical functioning of stroke patients.

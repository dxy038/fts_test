Objective: The visual analog scale spine score (VASSS) is a valid and reliable instrument for outcome assessment of patients with thoracic and lumbar spine fractures. The aim of this study was to prepare a Turkish version of the VASSS and to validate its use for assessing treatment outcomes in Turkish patients with spinal trauma.  Methods: The German version of the VASSS was blindly and independently translated into Turkish by three translators and modified by a team. Fifty patients who had been surgically treat¬ed for thoracic or lumbar fracture and a group of 50 healthy controls were evaluated using the VASSS, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), and Short Form 36 (SF-36). The Cronbach's alpha was performed to test the internal consisten¬cy of the score. Results: The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated as 0.965 in the overall assessment of the scale. Criterion validity measured by comparing the VASSS responses with the results of ODI, RMDQ, and SF-36 physical component (for ODI r=0.881, p<0.001; for RMDQ r=0.882, p<0.001; for SF-36 r=0.824, p<0.001). Construct validity tested by factor analysis yielded a fac¬torial structure of the questionnaire with 64.7% of cumulative percentage of explained variance, and Turkish version of the VASSS showed a similar structure than the original version. Conclusion: The Turkish version of the VASSS is a reliable and valid instrument to assess the outcome in patients with thoracic or lumbar spinal fractures in the Turkish population.

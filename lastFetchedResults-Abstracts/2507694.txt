Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of royal jelly (RJ) on serum biochemical
alterations and oxidative stress status in liver and pancreas of streptozotocin (STZ)-
induced diabetic rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, thirty two male Wistar rats were divided
into the following four groups (n=8/group): i. Control (C), ii. Diabetic (D), iii. Royal
jelly (R), and iv. Royal jelly-treated diabetic (D/R) groups. Diabetes was induced by single
intraperitoneal (IP) injection of STZ (60 mg/kg). The RJ [100 mg/kg body weight (BW)]
was administered orally for 42 days. Blood samples were used to determine serum levels
of insulin, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), total protein (TP), albumin, alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Also, the antioxidant status was evaluated by determining
the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) and ferric reducing antioxidant
power (FRAP) in liver and pancreas. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with P < 0.05 as the significant level.
Results: STZ-induced diabetic rats showed a significant elevation in the serum levels
of AST, ALT, ALP and FBG, whereas there was a significant decrease in serum levels of
insulin, albumin, HDL-c and TP (P < 0.05). Treatment of the diabetic rats with RJ restored
the changes of the above parameters to their normal levels (P < 0.05). In addition, RJ
significantly improved reduced levels of FRAP and CAT as well as high MDA level in
liver and pancreas (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: RJ improves oxidative damage induced by STZ in the liver and pancreas
of rats; therefore, it can be considered as an effective and alternative treatment
for diabetes.

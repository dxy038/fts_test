A novel distributed end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning architecture based on the concept of decoupling the end-to-end QoS provisioning from the service provisioning at routers in the differentiated service (DiffServ) network is proposed. The main objective of this architecture is to enhance the QoS granularity and flexibility offered in the DiffServ network model and improve both the network resource utilization and user benefits. The proposed architecture consists of a new endpoint admission control referred to as explicit endpoint admission control at the user side, the service vector which allows a data flow to choose different services at different routers along its data path, and a packet marking architecture and algorithm at the router side. The achievable performance of the proposed approach is studied, and the corresponding results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can have better service differentiation capability and lower request dropping probability than the integrated service over DiffServ schemes. Furthermore, it is shown that it preserves a friendly networking environment for conventional transmission control protocol flows and maintains the simplicity feature of the DiffServ network model.

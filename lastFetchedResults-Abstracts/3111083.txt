This paper describes the adaptive prediction and control of a non-linear process with time delay. The process can be described approximately by a non-minimum phase linear system with time varying coefficients. An adaptive control strategy is needed to adapt to time-varying behavior of the process. An adaptive prediction and control scheme is used to accomplish this objective. Algorithms are described, simulation results are presented and implementation strategies of such systems are discussed.

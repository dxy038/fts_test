In this paper, we consider interval-valued programming where the objective function and the constrict conditions are interval-valued function. We define the concepts of MW optimal solution to interval-valued programming problem. Mond-WeirÂ´s type dual for interval-valued optimization problem is formulated. Under (p, r) - &#961; - (&#951;, &#952;) - invexity assumptions, weak, strong and converse duality results are proved.

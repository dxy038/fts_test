The vision of the autonomous surface vessel program is to develop an instrumented boat capable of robust, automatic sampling of oceanographic data at specific locations and depths in estuary and coastal waters. The objective of the WASP project was to develop an initial prototype of such a system including software, physical hardware and electronic components. The physical structure includes pontoons, vertical supports, and a platform housing the vesselÂ´s power source, onboard electronics and payload. The onboard electronics control the movement and functionality of the vessel and the payload of scientific instruments are attached to a winch for taking readings at depth. Also, the user interface developed for the wireless communication and control of the vessel is Internet based allowing the user to control the vessel anywhere in the world. This prototype will be integrated and tested in Elkhorn Slough during the summer of 2005 as part of an SCU-MBARI project. The work performed to date has been critical in the development of the ASV concept which is expected to lead to an operational system deployed in the Kasitsna Bay Laboratory in Alaska and other national estuaries.

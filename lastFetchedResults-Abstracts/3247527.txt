To improve software security, several techniques, including vulnerability modelling and security testing, have been developed but the problem remains unsolved. On one hand, the SECTEST workshop tries to answer how vulnerability modelling can help users understand the occurrence of vulnerabilities so to avoid them, and what the advantages and drawbacks of the existing models are to represent vulnerabilities. At the same time, the workshop tries to understand how to solve the challenging security testing problem given that testing the mere functionality of a system alone is already a fundamentally critical task, how security testing is different from and related to classical functional testing, and how to assess the quality of security testing. The objective of this workshop is to share ideas, methods, techniques, and tools about vulnerability modelling and security testing to improve the state of the art.

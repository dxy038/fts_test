The digestive system is the one of the important system in the human body, which plays major role directly or indirectly for the function of human body. Most of the people around the world have the digestive system disorders due to improper digestion of food due to inefficient performance of stomach activity. The main objective of this paper is to propose a novel method of finding the digestive system disorders using electrogastrogram [EGG], which is a non-invasive, cheap and painless method by detecting the electrical signal from the stomach cutaneously and also it act as a preliminary investigation without a need for endoscopy which is painful investigation. The recording setup explained in this proposed system includes LabVIEW software and hardware which is used to record the EGG for more than hundred patients, nearly 75% of the patients suffered from results in digestive system disorders such as Dyspepsia, Stomach ulcer, nausea, cyclic vomiting syndrome, etc. For the above said digestive system disorders dissimilarity is found in its frequency and amplitude compared with its normal individual parameter (3 cpm) at a fair amount of accuracy.

The motivation of this research is to develop a user friendly word prediction system augmented with virtual keyboard in the context of Indian languages. The objective would be not only to save keystrokes but also to reduce the cognitive load to compose the text accurately. In the context of Indian language, in addition to large alphabets sizes there are a lot of phonetically or graphically similar characters which needs more time to search the desired characters and occasionally leads to taping wrong characters. This issue can be addressed by highlighting the next probable characters and thus offering visual clue and mitigating errors. The proposed approach not only help in avoiding the error, it also highlight the required character when user have misspelled part of word while composing text.

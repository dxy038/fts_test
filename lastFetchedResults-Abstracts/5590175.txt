The factors that can influence the equipment optimization in filling construction of rock-fill dam are explained by analyzing the filling system of rock-fill dams in this paper, and an optimization model for equipment organization of fill construction of rock-fill dam is established, in which the minimum of unbalanced degree of filling intensity is taken as the objective function with constraint. The quantum discrete particle swarm optimization is used in the model solution. Based on the optimization model and algorithm, the hydraulic engineering construction management decision support system is developed by using an object-oriented methodology. The system is applied to a practical project successfully to obtain the optimum solution of equipment organization.

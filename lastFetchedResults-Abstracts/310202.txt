Objective
Combining information derived from cellular biomarkers as telomerase and genes encoding cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (p16INK4a and p15INK4b) is needed to facilitate the stratification of individual patients within the conventional clinicopathologic parameters.
Design and methods
One hundred forty laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) tissue specimens were investigated for telomerase activity and the deletions of p16INK4a and p15INK4b genes.
Results
Of the 140 tissues assayed, 71% demonstrated high telomerase activity, 68.6% and 80% showed deletions in p16INK4a and p15INK4b genes, respectively. Significant difference was observed between telomerase activity, p16INK4a and p15INK4b deletions among each other and with advanced stage, poorly differentiated grades, high proliferation and DNA aneuploidy. The markers and the aforementioned clinicopathological factors were correlated with progression in univariate analysis; and associated with survival in multivariate analysis.
Conclusion
Progression of LSCC is accompanied by a parallel increase in telomerase activity and deletions in cell-cycle regulators (p16INK4a, p15INK4b) which may assist in prognostication and better classification of patients for treatment.

Fuzzy C-Means is one of the clustering algorithms based on optimizing an objective function. The selection of the initial parameters of the number and the initial cluster centers play an important influence in the performance of the FCM. This paper proposes a new FCM clustering algorithm with two stages. The proposed algorithm not only resolves the problem of the initial choice of the cluster center effectively, but also decreases the time when clustering large volume of data. The computer simulation results show the effectivity and the superiority of the new algorithm.

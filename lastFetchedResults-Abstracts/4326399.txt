Requiring solid engineering disciplines and best practices rather than human talents for developing complex software systems results an increasing interest in software processes. The quality of software processes has considerable influence over the success of an organization. Process quality measurement addresses an essential and largely overlooked aspect of processes. We performed a case study on the application of a process quality measurement method with the main objective of examining the extent of the support it offers for software process improvement in practice. We discuss the challenges and lessons learned as well as the limitations of the measurement method applied.

This paper proposes a new type of cellular network allowing quick handover (HO) even though all are small cells. The objective of the network is packet transfer with little handover gap. All small cells in a localized area are connected with PON (Passive Optical Network) as the cost-effective backhaul network accommodating large number of BSs (Base Stations). Used protocol is based on 3G-LTE system easing procedures of handover and of roaming with widely-spread mobile network. The UE (User Equipment) directly requests HO to the target BS to reduce the HO gap, though the serving BS relays it in the conventional procedures. For this, neighboring BSs of the serving BS prepare handover resources like ID, downward packets in advance to HO, and the 3G-LTE protocol is slightly modified. One of the applications of the new network is a campus network replacing conventional LANs integrating telephone and IP access infrastructure.

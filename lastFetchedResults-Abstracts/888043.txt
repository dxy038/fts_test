Objective: Not knowing syntactic structures is one of the reasons behind weak reading comprehension. Poor readers may not be able to recognize syntactic structures and instead of processing the whole text, prefer word by word reading. Given thesemantic and syntactic features of the relative clauses, the issue of syntactic awareness has been widely investigated by many researchers. The purpose of the current study isto investigate the relationship betweenthe syntactic awareness and reading comprehension. In addition,an effort is made to develop an assessment tool for syntactic awareness Method:This study recruited a cumulative number of 160 male and female primary school grade four students (9-11 years old) through multi-stage cluster sampling,from threeregion of Tehran. The data collection instruments include reading literacy tests containing literary and informational texts (tests of PIRLS) to assess reading comprehension and researcher-made syntactic test to assess the syntactic awareness. Correlation and regression analyses were done to generate the descriptive report. Result: Regression analyses revealed that the syntactic awareness potentially predicts reading comprehension. Conclusion: Syntactic awareness is one of the factors affectingreading comprehension. It is therefore necessary for educational planners to considerthis variable as one of the determinants for  studentsâ€™ reading comprehension.

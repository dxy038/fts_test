The main objective of this study is to find out if organizational characteristics intervene in the relationship between CRM and organizational performance in the Nigerian insurance industry. Relevant literature was reviewed and a model consisting of fourteen variables was conceptualized and tested by means of empirical data collected through a questionnaire. A total of one hundred and eighty (180) copies of questionnaires were administered, one hundred and forty nine (149) copies were duly completed and returned. This represents a response rate of 82.78%. Partial correlation was used to test the hypothesis. Findings show that organizational characteristics (companies’ image and branch network) intervene in the relationship between CRM and organizational performance in the Nigerian insurance industry. The study also shows that the strength of the intervention of companies’ image is stronger than that of branch network. The study recommended that insurance companies should pay attention to their companies’ image and branch network as these constitutes the ‘tangibles’ which customers can use to judge the likely performance of the organization.

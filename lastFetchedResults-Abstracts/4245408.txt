In this article, we study a fuzzy optimization problem in business and economics. In this problem, a fuzzy price is determined using a linear one degree demand function. The objective is to find the optimal fuzzy revenue, which is derived from the fuzzy price. We use level (lambda, 1) interval-valued fuzzy numbers to consider fuzzy price and fuzzy revenue. Using signed distance to defuzzify, we can get the demand function and revenue function in fuzzy sense. What follows is that we can find the maximum revenue in fuzzy sense.

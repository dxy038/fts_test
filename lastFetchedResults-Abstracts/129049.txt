Background: The present study was conducted with the aim of determining the clinical and paraclinical aspects of tuberculous peritonitis in Iran.
Materials and methods: In a retrospective study, all patients whose diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis was confirmed by means of pathology, direct examination or culture were included. Results: The study population included 35 males and 148 females with the mean age of 29.5Â±I4.2 years. The most frequent clinical manifestations were abdominal distension (78%), weight loss (75%), fever (73%), abdominal pain (62%), and abdominal mass (40%). 43% of patients have shown manifestations of pulmonary tuberculosis. Positive tuberculin test was reported in 86% of patients. 23% of patients have ESR of greater than 100. Exudative fluid with the predominance of lymphocyte was found in 95% of patients. 100 patients have undergone laparoscopic examination, among which 85 had positive histology for tuberculous peritonitis. Conclusion: With respect to our findings, for patients presenting with abdominal distension, weight loss, fever, abdominal pain, and abdominal mass as well as positive tuberculin test the diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis should be brought in the attention. Definite diagnosis is facilitated by means of laparoscopy.

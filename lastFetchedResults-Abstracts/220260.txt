Considering the positive effects of silicon On salinity resistance by some agricultural plants,
an investigation was conducted with a completely randomized design of three replications. The
main objective was to determine the effect of silicon on nutrient content and nitrate
accumulation in lettuce. Electrical conductivity wasadjusted at 3 mmhos/cm through addition of
NaG Silicon was added through addition of a silicate compound in the ratio of 0, 0.5, 1.0 and
2.0 mM/lit. Mean analysis showed that calcium and magnesium contents of lettuce were
increased in 0.5 mM L" treatment while a higher amount of silicon decreased the amount of
calcium, magnesium and phosphorus. Increasing of Si up to 2.0 mM L" increased the amounts
of potassium, total nitrogen and nitrate in the plant, whereas the amount of Na was decreased
through this addition of silicon

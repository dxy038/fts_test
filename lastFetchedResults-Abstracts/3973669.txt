As the complexity and diversity of the application of DC and AC motor drives has increased, so too has the occurrence of problems that are often caused by the interaction between the components of the system. The actual problem and its associated concepts are termed the problem domain. Computer simulation of drives provides an economical means of analyzing drive systems in a controlled environment to ensure that the system is stable and operates as required. The means to input, process and extract the data from the simulation is termed the solution domain. This article examines the process of reengineering the CASED drive simulation package so that it can be accessible to engineers whose main forte is electrical machines and drives and who are not simulation specialists. The objective is to bring the solution domain closer to the problem domain

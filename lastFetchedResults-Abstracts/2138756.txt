Background and Objective: Antioxidants have been widely used as food additives to provide protection against oxidative degradation of foods. Because of undesirable side effects of synthetic antioxidants, there is a growing interest in searching for powerful but non-toxic antioxidants from natural resources, especially edible or medicinal plants. Although, several studies have shown that Salvia genus is one of the valuable sources of potent antioxidants, but there is not any study about antioxidant potentials of Salvia viridis.
Materials and Methods: Methanolic extract of Salvia viridis was analyzed for its total phenols, anthocyanins and flavonoids contents using spectrophotometric methods. Diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was used to evaluate its antioxidant properties.
Results: The results demonstrated that the methanolic extract of Salvia viridis has high contents of total phenols (272.2 mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight), flavonoid (187.3 mg quercetin equivalent/g dry weight) and anthocyanin (0.94 mg cyaniding-3-glycosid equivalent/g dry weight). Free radical-scavenging capacity of the methanolic extract was less (IC50: 35.7± 1.45 ?g/ml) than synthetic antioxidant Butylated Hydroxy Toluene (BHT) (IC50: 18.7± 0.23 ?g/ml).
Conclusion: On the basis of the results obtained, Salvia viridis could be valuable as a rich source of natural antioxidants for culinary purposes after passing proper toxicity test.

Visible (VIS) and near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to identify and authenticate different monosodium glutamate species. Samples from Xihu, Linhua, Taitaile and Foshou monosodium glutamate were homogenised and scanned in the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) region (325-1075 nm) in reflectance. Partial least squares (PLS) models were developed to identify different monosodium glutamate species. The model correctly classified more than 99% of the monosodium glutamate sample. The results showed the potential of VIS and NIR spectra as an objective and rapid method for authentication and identification of monosodium glutamate species

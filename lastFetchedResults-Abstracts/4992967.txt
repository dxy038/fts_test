An algorithm for underground object detection in GPR data is presented in this paper. It combines the advantages of Kalman filtering approach, suggested by Carevic (1999) with the robustness of hybrid Bayesian estimation technique. The objective is to increase the reliability of target detection and target-background separation while keeping a small false alarm rate. In addition, sequential change detection (CUSUM) test is studied for the purposes of ground layers segmentation and object recognition.

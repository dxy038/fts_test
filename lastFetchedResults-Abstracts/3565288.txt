In this paper, an adaptive tradeoff model (ATM) is proposed for constrained evolutionary optimization. In this model, three main issues are considered: (1) the evaluation of infeasible solutions when the population contains only infeasible individuals; (2) balancing feasible and infeasible solutions when the population consists of a combination of feasible and infeasible individuals; and (3) the selection of feasible solutions when the population is composed of feasible individuals only. These issues are addressed in this paper by designing different tradeoff schemes during different stages of a search process to obtain an appropriate tradeoff between objective function and constraint violations. In addition, a simple evolutionary strategy (ES) is used as the search engine. By integrating ATM with ES, a generic constrained optimization evolutionary algorithm (ATMES) is derived. The new method is tested on 13 well-known benchmark test functions, and the empirical results suggest that it outperforms or performs similarly to other state-of-the-art techniques referred to in this paper in terms of the quality of the resulting solutions.

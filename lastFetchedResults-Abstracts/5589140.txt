A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a heterogeneous network; a collection of mobile wireless devices with different characteristics communicating in a random network topology. Much research over-simplifies by assuming that all nodes are homogeneous, i.e., possess identical transmission power, reception quality and signal to noise ratio, which is not realistic. Such conditions are ideal and not often found in real world situations. Some existing routing protocols are also equally restricted in that equal bidirectional links and symmetrical paths are implicit in their operation. This again is not always the case and thus such algorithms are not able to react to or exploit the full connectivity of the network. Some previous researchers have shown that a unidirectional rather than a bidirectional approach can be used to advantage and improve MANET performance in terms of a number of key performance metrics (e.g., shortest path, average end-to-end delay, and packet delivery ratio). In this paper, a new Dynamic Reverse Route Ad hoc on Demand Distance Vector (DR-AODV) routing protocol is proposed. This scheme computes routing path with the lowest delay while providing resilience and fast reverse route recovery when subjected to unidirectional links. Simulation results show that DR-AODV perform well in scenarios where the numbers of unidirectional links are exceptionally high when compared to basic AODV and AODV-Blacklist schemes.

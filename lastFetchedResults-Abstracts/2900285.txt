Direct energy conversion from sunlight to electricity is obtained through solar cells. The Efficiency of solar cells is about 23.89% in the laboratory and 13.76%. More than 30% of incident light is reflected back from the surface of single crystalline Silicon (Si) solar cells because of the high refractive index of Silicon material. The initial objective of this project is to minimize the reflection losses in solar cells using an Anti-Reflection coating (ARC). In solar cell applications, a single layer thin film Anti-Reflective coating is often used. But such a Single Layer Anti-Reflective coating (SLARC) and Double layer Anti-Reflective coating reduces reflectivity only in a limited range. Triple Layer Anti reflective coatings (TLARC) are so widely utilized to improve conversion efficiencies and current density of silicon solar cells. Such Triple layer antireflective coating can eliminate the need for a mechanical tracking device for proper optical alignment of the solar cell with respect to incident sunlight.

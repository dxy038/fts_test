The primary goal of this paper is to save logistics cost and reach optimizing configuration of import crude oil transportation network. Firstly, based on the investigation of China´s domestic oil production and consumption, this paper makes a detailed analysis on the source regions, flow, transportation routes and accommodating ports of import crude oil. Thereafter, an optimization model is put forward with an objective function of minimum logistics expense. Then, the model is carried out by Genetic Algorithm (GA) and MATLAB with original data of 2007 and predicted data of 2012. Optimum arrangement of tanker´s voyage amount and import oil allocation in addition to selection of crude oil logistics center are given as optimized results. Results indicate that large VLCC of 260000-320000 tons is the main tanker type in import crude oil transportation network. And crude oil logistics bases will be formed which are represented by Qingdao, Dalian, Tianjin, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Zhanjiang and Maoming in coastal areas.

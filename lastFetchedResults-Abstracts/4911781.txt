Taking objectives as players, by calculating the affecting factors of the design variables to objective functions a, the design variables are divided into different strategic spaces owned by each player. Based on Stackelberg oligarch game model, each game player takes its payoff as mono-objective to optimize its own strategic spaces and obtains the best strategy to deal with the others. All the best strategies are combined as a game strategy set. By multi-gaming, the final solution meeting given convergence of criterion is obtained.

Business negotiation is a key technique for the development of electronic commerce. Negotiation is a means for agents to communicate and compromise to reach mutually beneficial agreements. This paper presents a new model for bilateral multi-objective negotiation under fuzzy preferences and time constraints in an incomplete information setting. This paper employs the theory of fuzzy mathematics to analyze negotiation model,In this model, the order in which objects are bargained over and agreements are reached is determined exogenously, as part of the bargaining equilibrium. In this context, This paper proposes nine negotiation scenarios based on the agentspsila fuzzy preferences and time constraints. The analysis on this model shows that the negotiation can reach equilibrium before the deadlines in all proposed negotiation scenarios. This result is checked by using a numerical experiment to simulate the negotiation process.

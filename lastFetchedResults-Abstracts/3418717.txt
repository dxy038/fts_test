This paper extends a number of results on the infinite-length minimum-mean-square-error decision Feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) reported by Cioffi, Dudevoir, Eyuboglu and Forney (see IEEE Trans. Commun., 1995) to the finite-length case. Cholesky factorization and displacement structure theory are demonstrated to be two powerful analytical tools for analyzing the finite-length MMSE-DFE. Our objective throughout the paper is to establish finite-length analogs of the well-known infinite-length MMSE-DFE results. Similarities and differences between the two cases are examined and delineated. Finally, convergence of our derived finite-length results to their well-established infinite-length counterparts is shown

The software BOOLE-DEUSTO is oriented to the design of digital electronic circuits from the student point of view. On the other hand, WebLab-DEUSTO is a well known remote laboratory, and one of the implemented experiments is focused on CPLD and digital electronics. The objective of this paper is to describe the results of connecting BOOLE-DEUSTO and WebLab-DEUSTO. Under this common approach, a novel student can design a digital circuit using K maps, truth tables, Boolean expressions, etc. and then, automatically, he/she can implement, download and see the real circuit in the remote lab.

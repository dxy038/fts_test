This paper presents an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) applied to the teaching of anatomy of the female breast, including some types of cancer related to this organ. This ITS is composed of four modules: Student, an Expert System containing a questionnaire for the diagnosis of the learnerÂ´s profile; Tutor, an Artificial Neural Network Interactive Activation and Competition, for the application of teaching techniques; Domain, some ontologies containing content and related media; and Interface, developed as an Adaptive Hypermedia System. The objective of this work is to lift requirements for the integration of various modeling types that use Artificial Intelligence techniques in the same ITS, even enabling the use of this system in a Medical Simulation Environment. The validation process of this ITS is in progress because the class period has not yet started at three universities: the University of Brasilia (Federal) and the Catholic University of Brasi&#769;lia (Private), both located in Brasilia, Brazil, and the Universidad de La Frontera (Federal) located in Temuco, Chile.

This paper investigates and extends the Surrogate Worth Tradeoff (SWT) Method of Haimes and Hall [1974] for the solution of multiple objective problems. The general multiobjective problem is reviewed. The geometric interpretation of the worth functions Wij and the interrelationships among the various Wij as well as the tradeoff rates of the ith and Jth objectives, ??ij are studied; a modification of the definition of the worth functions guarantees their applicability to a wider class of problems. Theoretical bases for the methodologies discussed are established. Two algorithms which utilize different approaches for implementing the SWT method are described, and the problem of allocation of stream resources is solved as a multiple objective problem by the SWT method. Computational results are presented and analyzed.

Describes a novel neural-network architecture, the neural network loop (NNL), and its learning rules. It can operate as Hopfield, BAM (bidirectional associative memory), and other kinds of neural networks. In particular, it can perform multiple category associative memory. This capability is very similar to that of the human brain. It can be applied to pattern recognition and associative memory. Computer simulation was carried out, and the results prove that NNL is an effective network

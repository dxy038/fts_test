Her symptoms continued despite the medical therapy. During heart monitoring in CCU, she developed a narrow QRS complex tachycardia with rate of 150 beats/min. After injection of adenosine, venticular rate slowed down and the flutter waves were appeared. In electrophysiology study (EPS), reverse atrial flutter was induced. Bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus block by application of radiofrequency energy was done for her. No arrhythmia was induced after radiofrequency ablation. The patient was discharged and during follow up is free of symptoms.

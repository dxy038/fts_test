An expectation-based approach and a variance-based approach are highlighted in this paper. Experiments are conducted on a single-objective test function adopting three unequal values of dimension size, solved by an chaotic evolutionary algorithm. In both former low-dimensional cases, graphical results are given to make a visual comparison between the two robustness measures, which shows that their searching ability is complementary. Then a dominance mechanism similar to the definition of domination in multi-objective optimization is suggested, and integrated with chaotic evolutionary algorithm for selection of a survival between two individuals in single-objective evolutionary optimization. In the third high-dimensional case, solved by modified chaotic evolutionary algorithm with variance-based measure approach, good numerical results are reported.

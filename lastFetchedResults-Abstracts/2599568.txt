Introduction: Dazinon (DZN) as organophosphate insecticide induces oxidative stress. Vitamins E and C are antioxidants protecting cells from oxidative stress. 
Objective: To determine the modulation of diazinon-induced oxidative stress by vitamins E and C in rat brain.
Materials and Methods: In present experimental study, male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups including: control (corn oil as DZN solvent), DZN (100 mg/kg), vitamin E (150 mg/kg), vitamin C (200 mg/kg), vitamin E+DZN and vitamin C+DZN groups, all of which were given intraperitoneally. 24 hours after injection, animals were anesthetized by ether, and brain tissue was quickly removed. After tissues hemogenation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, as well as glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined by biochemical methods. 
Results: DZN increased SOD (p < 0.001) and GST (p < 0.01) activities and MDA level (p < 0.01), while it decreased CAT and LDH activities and GSH content (p < 0.01) in brain compared with the control group. Administration of vitamin E or vitamin C inhibited the changed in these parameters. 
Discussion: Administration of vitamin E or vitamin C as antioxidant decreases DZN toxicity by scavenging free radicals but it does not protect completely.

Objective. –  Electrical remodeling as well as atrial contractile dysfunction after the conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm (SR) are mainly caused by a reduction of the inward L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL). We investigated whether the expression of L-type Ca2+-channel subunits was reduced in atrial myocardium of AF patients.

Methods. – Right atrial appendages were obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CAD, n = 35) or mitral valve surgery (MVD, n = 37). Seventeen of the CAD patients and 18 of the MVD patients were in chronic (>3 months) AF, whereas the others were in SR. The protein expression of the L-type Ca2+-channel subunits α1C and β2 was quantified by western blot analysis. Furthermore, we measured the density of dihydropyridine (DHP)-binding sites of the L-type Ca2+ channel using 3H-PN220-100 as radioligand.

Results. – Surprisingly, the α1C and the β2-subunit expression was not altered in atrial myocardium of AF patients. Also, the DHP-binding site density was unchanged.

Conclusion. – The protein expression of the L-type Ca2+-channel subunits α1C or β2 is not reduced in atrial myocardium of AF patients. Therefore, the reduced ICaL might be due to downregulation of other accessory subunits (α2δ), expression of aberrant subunits, changes in channel trafficking or alterations in channel function.

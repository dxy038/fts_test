In order to increase spectral efficiency, it is becoming more and more important that next generation wireless networks wisely integrate multiple services such as transmissions of private, common, and confidential messages at the physical layer. This is referred to as physical layer service integration, and in this paper is being studied for bidirectional relay networks. Here, a relay node establishes a bidirectional communication between two other nodes using a decode-and-forward protocol. This is also known as two-way relaying. In the broadcast phase, the relay efficiently integrates additional common and confidential services at the physical layer, which then requires the study of the bidirectional broadcast channel (BBC) with common and confidential messages. The entire secrecy capacity regions for discrete memoryless and MIMO Gaussian channels are established. These results further unify previous partial results such as the BBC with common messages or the classical broadcast channel with common and confidential messages, where the relay node provides only some of the services.

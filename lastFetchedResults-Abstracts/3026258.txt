Although computer-mediated communication (CMC) is popular, past research shows that face-to-face (FTF) interaction is also important in CMC environments. The question is what are the accelerators for FTF interaction in CMC scenarios? A literature review finds the accelerators of familiarity among group members and personality factors related to E/I (extraversion/introversion) important factors to consider in FTF interaction. The focus, therefore, of this study is on proximate group support system (GSS) environments that have both CMC and FTF interactions. The objective of the study is to reveal the impacts of familiarity among group members and E/I on verbal interaction in GSS sessions. A proposed causal model, in which verbal and GSS interactions are mediators between the combinations of "group member familiarity &amp; E/I factors," and "meeting satisfaction &amp; group cohesion," is tested. To examine the model, eight proximate GSS sessions are observed and data are gathered using questionnaires from 59 participants. The data are then analyzed using path analysis. Results show that verbal and GSS interactions do not positively mediate between the combinations of "group member\Â´s familiarity &amp; E/I factors," and "meeting satisfaction &amp; group cohesion." This means that verbal interaction is independent from personal factors such as familiarity or E/I and, probably, meeting management factors are important to accelerate verbal interaction among participants. Implications of these findings are discussed within the context of virtual and/or asynchronous meetings.

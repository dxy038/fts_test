This paper proposes methods for the modeling and analysis of signal integrity (SI) and radiated emission (RE) of capacitively loaded printed circuit board interconnections. Two techniques are considered for achieving a high level of SI, namely, source series damping and destination parallel damping. Low-order models are developed for the two methods, which enable a comparison of their SI performance and the identification of the key parameters that affect SI. Under certain conditions, the two methods are shown to have approximately the same SI performance. However, the two techniques can exhibit different characteristics in other respects, such as power dissipation, peak current, and RE. One particular characteristic that is studied in this paper is the performance with respect to far-field REs. A key objective of this paper is to develop a quantitative analysis and a qualitative understanding of the interplay between electromagnetic compatibility-electromagnetic interference and SI for the two damping techniques.

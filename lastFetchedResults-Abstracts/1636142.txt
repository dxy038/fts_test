Knowing the virtual packing densities of all the components in a mixture is necessary to calculate its granular packing density with the compressible packing model. The calculation of these virtual packing densities is based on real packing density measurements carried out according to specific operating modes, each one with a different compaction index K. For powders, the current method consists in adding water to powder in a mixer until obtaining a smooth paste (K = 6.7). But this method remains subjective since the degree of smoothness achieved is estimated by the operator. The objective of this work is to put forward a more rational alternative method based on tests of normal consistency used in cement plants. This paper presents experiments on binary mixtures (cementâ€“mineral admixtures), with or without superplasticizer, which have resulted in a compaction index K = 4.8. Using these results, the amount of water (given in the technical data sheet) needed to obtain a normal consistency allows the calculation of virtual packing densities of standardized cements. However, if a superplasticizer is used it is necessary to carry out this test. Its saturation proportion can also be estimated with the test of normal consistency.

A novel bidirectional switch structure is proposed for high power matrix converter applications. The proposed circuit includes a simple RC circuit as commutation aid. No extra sensing information is needed during commutation, making it possible to perform conventional dead time commutation. Hence, the operation of the proposed circuit is very stable, reliable and robust. In this paper, Basic knowledge of bidirectional switches and commutation techniques for matrix converters are reviewed. Detailed commutation procedure of the proposed circuit is performed, and the choice of specific semiconductor switches and devices is also derived and given. Finally, experimental results show the validity and verification of the proposed structure and circuit.

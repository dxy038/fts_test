The objective of the paper is to review and report on the perspectives of research in the area of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs). CLSCs is the ultimate sustainability concept in Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) that currently draws the attention from practitioners as well as the academicians. CLSCs involves the integration between the forward and reverse logistics with the aim of reducing the waste. In this paper, the method of content analysis was used to review articles published in the areas of production and operations management, business logistics and logistics management. The result of review revealed that the study in CLSCs is still limited and inadequate. Nevertheless, the research in the area is growing due to its prominent contribution towards social, economic and environmental protection. Hence, the study is expected to benefit the researchers by providing appropriate research direction for future research in the field of CLSCs.

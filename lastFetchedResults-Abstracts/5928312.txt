For the purpose of evaluating the performance of university researchers with objective, just and scientific, on the basis of surveying the achievements appraisal and rewarding method of many universities, it shows a quantization index system of performance evaluation for university researchers, takes a transition from qualitative analysis to quantitative analysis for each index system, and builds quantitative model of performance evaluation. It realizes the large quantity and complex mathematical calculation and disposal of whole process by computer software design; different universities would fulfill the actual requirements by modifying qualitative description base of indexes in all levels and its corresponding index value base, as well as the conversion base of actual and standard number, the system is commonality and flexibility.

This paper concerns on a two-machine flow-shop scheduling problem with controllable processing times modeled by a non-linear convex resource consumption function. The objective is to minimize the resource consumption that is needed to control the makespan not to exceed the given deadline. A tabu-search algorithm is designed, which searches for the optimal or near optimal job-processing sequence, while the processing times of the operations are determined by an optimal resource allocation algorithm thereafter. Numerical experiment shows the tabu-search algorithm is able to provide optimal or near-optimal solutions for medium or large-scaled problems.

We propose a novel localized Integrated Location Service and Routing (ILSR) scheme, based on the geographic routing protocol GFG, for data communications from sensors to a mobile sink in wireless sensor networks. The objective is to enable each sensor to maintain a slow-varying routing next hop to the sink rather than the precise knowledge of quick-varying sink position. In ILSR, sink updates location to neighboring sensors after or before a link breaks and whenever a link creation is observed. Location update relies on flooding, restricted within necessary area, where sensors experience (next hop) change in GFG routing to the sink. Dedicated location update message is additionally routed to selected nodes for prevention of routing failure. Considering both unpredictable and predictable (controllable) sink mobility, we present two versions. We prove that both of them guarantee delivery in a connected network modeled as unit disk graph. ILSR is the first localized protocol that has this property. We further propose to reduce message cost, without jeopardizing this property, by dynamically controlling the level of location update. A few add-on techniques are as well suggested to enhance the algorithm performance. We compare ILSR with an existing competing algorithm through simulation. It is observed that ILSR generates routes close to shortest paths at dramatically lower (90% lower) message cost.

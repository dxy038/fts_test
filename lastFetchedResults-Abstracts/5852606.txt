This paper presents a novel algorithm for enhancement of spatial resolution of images. The proposed algorithm estimates a Least square based predictor of lower order and interpolates the coefficients of higher order predictor. We have reduced the predictor order form p to (p-1) that results into a saving of computational power. The proposed algorithm is generic that can be used with most of the LS based interpolation algorithms reported in literature. We have shown that use of interpolated prediction coefficient causes insignificant loss in subjective as well as objective (PSNR) quality of the higher resolution (HR) image as compared with the PSNR obtained by the actual prediction coefficient and there is around 40% to 50% reduction in computational complexity.

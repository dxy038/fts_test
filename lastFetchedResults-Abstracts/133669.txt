BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: One of the most important mutations, which occur in hepatitis B virus, is precore mutant. This mutation is associated with highly productive infection in anti HBe+ chronic HBV carriers. These chronic HBV carriers are predisposed to developing active hepatitis. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HBV DNA in chronic anti HBe+ HBV carriers in Babol.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with Anti HBe+ chronic HBV carriers in Babol during 2002. In all cases, HBV DNA was assayed by PCR. Prevalence of HBV DNA in males, females and different age groups were compared with X2 test.
FINDINGS: Of 257 cases of anti HBe+ (mean age ± SD, 32.3 ± 11.2 years), HBV DNA was positive in 222 (86.4%) cases. HBV DNA was positive in 136 (87.2%) of 156 males and 86 (85.15%) of 101 female cases (p=0.7). There was no significant difference in prevalence of HBV DNA between age groups (p=0.07).
CONCLUSION: These results show that the high prevalence of HBV precore mutants in this region. Follow up of these individuals are necessary.

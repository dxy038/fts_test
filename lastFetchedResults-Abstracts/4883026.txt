Summary from only given. The array shaped beam of a Ti:sapphire laser with chirp compensation and pulse durations down to 8.6 fs was imaged by a microscope objective and detected by a CCD camera (1300 /spl times/ 1030 pixels). Second-order interference measurements were performed with SHG (100 /spl mu/m BBO crystal). Fringe processing software was applied to extract contrast and concurrence matrix.

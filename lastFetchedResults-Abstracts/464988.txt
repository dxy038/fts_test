OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the relative power of basal inhibin and follicle-stimulating hormone (defined before treatment) and the woman's age both as single and combined predictors of ovarian response in an in vitro fertilization program where pituitary desensitization was routinely used. STUDY DESIGN: The study was a retrospective analytic investigation of 120 women undergoing the first cycle of in vitro fertilization. Forty consecutive cycles canceled because of poor follicular response were initially selected. As a control group, the nearest completed in vitro fertilization cycles before and after each canceled cycle (i.e., the closest cycles in temporal relationship to the index cycle) were used. RESULTS: The mean age and basal follicle-stimulating hormone level were significantly higher in the canceled than in the control group, whereas the basal inhibin level was significantly higher in the latter. Follicle-stimulating hormone and inhibin alone, with an accuracy (predictive value of ovarian response) of 70%, were better predictors of cancellation than age was. Any two or all three of these variables studied did not improve the predictive value of follicle-stimulating hormone or inhibin alone. CONCLUSION: Age is a poorer predictor than pretreatment basal follicle-stimulating hormone and inhibin levels for ovarian response in in vitro fertilization cycles stimulated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist - gonadotropin treatment. Basal follicle-stimulating hormone and inhibin have similar predictive properties and could therefore be used interchangeably. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:1226-30.)

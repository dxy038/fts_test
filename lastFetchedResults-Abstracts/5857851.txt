By means of a software package ANSYS10.0 of finite element analysis, this paper studies the influences of steel reinforced ratio, wallboard thickness and bidirectional cross mode of wire-mesh frame on mechanical properties of wire-mesh frame wallboard. It provides a basis for development and commercial applications of the new type structure and insulation wall cladding with energy saving.

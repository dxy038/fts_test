Objective: Annexin A1 (ANXA1) is suggested to have anti-inflammatory function. However,
the precise function of ANXA1 has remained unclear. In this study, we therefore
examined the potency of ANXA1 in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
and suppressing pro-inflammatory responses in PC12 cells induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium
(MPP+).
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, cDNA of ANXA1 was cloned and
inserted to the PGL268 pEpi-FGM18F vector to produce a recombinant PGL/ANXA1 vector
for transfection into the PC12 cells. ANXA1 transfected cells were then treated with
MPP+. Apoptosis and the content of pro-inflammatory factors including ROS, Interlukin-6
(IL-6), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-?B) were
assessed by flow-cytometry, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
and western blot in ANXA1-transfected cells and the data were compared with those obtained
from mock and control cells.
Results: Data revealed that overexpression of ANXA1 is associated with decreased levels
of ROS and expression level of IL-6 and iNOS transcripts, and NF-?B protein in MPP+
treated PC12 cells.
Conclusion: ANXA1 may be considered as an agent for prevention of neurodegenerative
or inflammatory conditions.

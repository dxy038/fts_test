We present improved algorithms for automatic fade and dissolve detection in digital video analysis. We devise new two-step algorithms for fade and dissolve detection and introduce a method for eliminating false positives from a list of detected candidate transitions. In our detailed study of these gradual shot transitions, our objective has been to accurately classify the type of transitions (fade-in, fade-out, and dissolve) and to precisely locate the boundary of the transitions. This distinguishes our work from early work in scene change detection which focuses on identifying the existence of a transition rather than its precise temporal extent. We evaluate our algorithms against two other commonly used methods on a comprehensive data set, and demonstrate the improved performance due to our enhancements

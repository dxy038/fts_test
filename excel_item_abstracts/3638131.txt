The boundary element method using electric field and magnetic flux density has been applied to three-dimensional electromagnetic field problems. It is also possible to use the magnetic vector potential as an unknown vector variable. Formulas for the boundary element method using the vector potential are derived. Furthermore, the external conditions for the vector potential in the boundary element method are discussed in connection with a three-dimensional magnetostatic problem. The convergence characteristics of the proposed boundary element method are verified

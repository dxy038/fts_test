Objective of this paper is to estimate the effective elastic properties of metal-ceramic interpenetrating phase composites (IPC). To this end, approximate analytical models such as Feng’s and Tuchinskii’s model were employed and checked against Voigt, Reuss, and Hashin–Shtrikman bounds. On the other hand, the overall elastic properties of IPC were determined by means of some numerical models suitable for the interpenetrating networks with model microstructures. A real Al2O3–Cu microstructure acquired from the computer tomography images was also used for numerical simulations.

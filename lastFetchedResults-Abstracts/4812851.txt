In this paper, we mainly research three aspects content, that is 1) The intelligent sensing system for chemical gas leak, which consists of three units. Many sensors are installed on the twelve different areas of easily leaking, if there are leak, will transmit the leaking area to the main computer of manipulator. 2) According to the 1)Â´ information, a navigation system of mobile manipulator is designed, which puts forward using CCD to recognize colour road, which is laid on the ground, to arrive at the aim. In the process of navigation, adopts a new fuzzy control strategy, when the curving extent of path satisfies definite condition, adopting fuzzy control with Genetic Algorithm off-line optimizing the membership function parameters of fuzzy controller. 3) After arriving at the leaking area, the exact orientation of manipulator is implemented by visual and ultrasonic sensor. Segmenting the objective figure uses group colour up method and recognition object uses invariant moments. The whole process is applied on the HEBUT-II intelligent mobile manipulator. The result proves its validity and feasibility.

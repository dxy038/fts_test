As the Simo&#769;n Boli&#769;var University (USB) have experimental character, their curricula have undergone continuous evaluations. In particular, the curriculum design of the Computer Engineering career incorporated the subject "Mini-Project of Software Development". Its primary objective is to create in students the competences to develop quality software. In this paper, we present the results obtained in five experiences of "mini projects". After being valued by key stakeholders (teachers and students), we obtained the conceptualization of this innovative learning experience. We used the curricular design model competences-based. For students this experience was positive because they have started in the area of applied research, they have implemented theoretical knowledge, they have solved problems through of the supervisors\Â´ coaching, they have used collaborative technology tools for effective communication, they have obtained feedback from teachers assessors and they have achieved to form working teams.

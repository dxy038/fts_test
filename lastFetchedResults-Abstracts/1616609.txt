   The objective of this study was to examine the effect of planting date and heat stress during flowering on yield and grain yield components of 3 spring canola cultivars. The experiment was conducted at Shoushtar  Islamic Azad University  during 2010-2011 cropping year.The experiment was conducted as a split plot randomized complete block design with 4 replications in Shoushtar Azad University in 2011-2012 cropping year. Three planting date 21 November, 10 and 30 December were as main factors and three Canola cultivars Hyola 308, Sarigol and Heros as subfactors. The results showed that biological and grain yield as well as yield components (except the number of seeds per silique) decreased significantly with delay in sowing date. Grain yield and yield components were significantly different among cultivars, however biological yield was not. Hyola 308 and Heros cultivars produced the highest and lowest (3189. 1 and 2017. 5 kg/ha) grain yield, respectively. Among grain yield components, silique number per plant was more indicator of cultivars yield than two other components. However, seed number per silique was effective on graining yield of Hyola 308 cultivar. Early cultivar (Hyola 308) in first planting date 21 November and late cultivar (Heros) in late planting date 30 December  produced the highest (3630. 3 kg/ha) and the lowest (1310. 2 kg/ha) grain yields, respectively. Based on the results of this study, middle and late maturing cultivars of canola are not suitable for khouzestan climatic conditions, and early maturing cultivars can be more useful to avoid heat stress.

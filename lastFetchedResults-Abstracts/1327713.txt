China Railway is undertaking massive construction and development projects.

onable and resource-leveled schedule that allows for adjustments for unforeseen circumstances during construction is critical for managing railway construction projects. Currently, most construction projects use traditional network planning methods or the Gantt schedule for project management. However, these methods have limited applicability to railway construction projects, which are typically linear. This study uses the linear scheduling method and constraint programming techniques for solving schedule control problems faced during railroad construction. The proposal comprises a schedule control model, scheduling model, and schedule control system; the scheduling model is central to the schedule control model. Characteristics such as high flexibility and practicality facilitate multi-objective optimization during scheduling and modification of the linear schedule. The proposed model and algorithm were validated by comparing results with actual data from a highway construction project and the Urumqiâ€“Dzungaria railway construction project.

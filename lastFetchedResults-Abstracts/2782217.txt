In the case of an unavoidable frontal collision between a vehicle and a pedestrian, the activation of a protection system can reduce the severity of injuries caused by the collision. However, to fulfill this objective, it is necessary to determine when the shock will occur. To overcome this problem, we place inside the front bumper a metallic sheet that emits an electric field. This field is oriented toward the front of the vehicle by means of various guard screens. The intrusion into the emitted electric field induces a capacitive coupling with the sensor. Which will enable the electronic device to detect the presence of the pedestrian at a distance of 1 m. To avoid slow drifts in time, the change in capacity is measured every millisecond. The last hundred acquisitions are considered as a history. This history is compared with the signature of a pedestrian who was established in the laboratory. When the pedestrian is about a thirty centimeters of the vehicle and the shock is inevitable, the protection systems are activated. When the vehicle is at very low speed, this device can be used as parking assistance.

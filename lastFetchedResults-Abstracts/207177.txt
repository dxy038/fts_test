Patients and Methods: Ninety students with a confirmed diagnosis of pediculosis were selected from rural schools and randernly treated in 3 equal groups with the mentioned medications. The results were evaluated after 24 hours, 1,2 and 6 weeks.Results: The rate of healing was 83.3% , 100%, 100% after 24 hours, 70% , 93.3% , 90% after 1 week, 63.3%, 90%, 76.7% after 2
weeks and 40%, 83.3% , 66.7% after 6 weeks in patients treated with Lindan, permethrin , and Copex powder, respectively (P<0.05, chi-square test).

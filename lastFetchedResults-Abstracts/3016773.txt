This paper demonstrates how finite inclusions theorem (FIT) synthesis can enhance the robustness properties of nominal controller designs. FIT used to generate a simultaneous plant family stabilization algorithm. Major objective is to expand the controller synthesis methodology and create an algorithm to synthesize a single, simultaneously stabilizing controller for a finite set of plant families. Finally, the capabilities of this controller synthesis tool will be demonstrated in example. The example is shown how FIT synthesis can be used to achieve robustness properties by redesigning an initial controller.

The author argues that electrical engineering is a continuum which, by definition, is unbroken and in which each individual electrical engineer has played some part in ensuring an enhanced knowledge base and a better life for the next generation. The development of electrical engineering, however, is also lateral and accelerating in its breadth, leading to the explosion in knowledge. He argues that the ability needed to understand and harness this must also expand. In order that progress may continue, each enterprise must be underpinned by corresponding improvements in individual and corporate communication skills and understanding. These must at least keep pace with the knowledge explosion that we constantly witness. He argues that it is only if this objective is achieved that electrical engineers will be able to claim, with confidence, that they have maintained progress and benefited mankind.

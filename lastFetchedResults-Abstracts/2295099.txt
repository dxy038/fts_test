Background and Objective: Tooth eruption is universal, recurrent and easily observed. The aim of this study was to investigate the parental beliefs about teething signs and symptoms. 

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a random sample of 534 parents attending Health Care Centers, Tehran, Iran. The questionnaire contained two sections: Section (1) surveyed parents and their children’s demographic characteristics. Section (2) aimed to assess the general knowledge and beliefs of parents regarding their children’ teething. The analysis of data was carried out using SPSS software and descriptive statistics and the chi-squared test (p < 0.05).

Results: Response to teething was incorrectly attributed to fever (67.6%), diarrhea (58.1%), and sleep disturbances (46.4%). Only 69.7% of parents allowed their children to bite on chilled objects to relieve symptoms associated with teething.

Conclusion: This study shows a common lack of knowledge and beliefs about teething among parents. Parents should be better educated about the teething process and the proper management of teething troubles by the dental health care providers.

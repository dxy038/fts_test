The objective of the present study was to measure the specific draught (force per cross-sectional area of worked soil) and energy use for soil fragmentation for different tillage implements and soil conditions. Draught was calculated from measurements of fuel consumption and speed during tillage with a mouldboard plough and a chisel plough set to working depths of 13, 17 and 21 cm, and a disc harrow. Tillage was carried out at three different water contents (“Wet”, “Moist” and “Dry”) on two sites. The average working depth was calculated from weighing the loose soil within a 0.25-m2 frame. Specific area of the soil was determined by sieving. Soil strength was measured in situ using a shear vane and a penetrometer. Average working depth was much less than the set working depth for the chisel plough. Specific draught was generally the lowest for the mouldboard plough and the highest for the chisel plough, and increased with decreasing soil water content. The specific draught was strongly correlated to soil cohesion, but not to penetration resistance. The proportion of coarse aggregates after tillage was the highest for the mouldboard plough and the lowest for the moist soil. The energy use for soil fragmentation was in most cases the lowest for the disc harrow, while there were small differences between the chisel and the mouldboard ploughs. The results show that the mouldboard plough is energy efficient for loosening soil, while the disc harrow is energy efficient for soil fragmentation during primary tillage. Tillage at an intermediate water content, close to the plastic limit, gave the largest proportion of small aggregates and consequently the lowest energy use for soil fragmentation.

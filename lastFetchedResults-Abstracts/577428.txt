Introduction & Objective: Large group of premature births alone causes mortality and morbidity in children in developing countries make up and increase the incidence of neonatal complications: respiratory distress (RDS) is a major cause of infant death is. This study aimed to determine the effect of dexamethasone on the outcome. Preterm labor at 36-30 weeks of pregnancy, referring to the training center - Specialized Design and Kosar was performed.
Materials & Methods: A Quasi-experimental over 176 pregnant women with 36-30 weeks referred to Centre Educational - Specialized Kosar in 1385 was conducted. Data from the questionnaires and made the case infants hospitalized in neonatal centers - Health Motahari and Imam Khomeini (RA) collected using statistical software SPSS and descriptive and analytical statistical tests (Chi-square, and logistic regression ) were analyzed.
Results: Neonatal exposure to the disease than hyaline membranes and respiratory distress in the group receiving dexamethasone 29.1percent in control group 35.1percent, which was statistically significant difference, was found. However, administration of dexamethasone before delivery in the neonatal death rate for group 26.5percent versus 10.3percent of the control group was reduced, which was statistically significant. (Chi = 7 / 36 P-Value = 0 / 005)
Conclusion: Received dexamethasone before delivery reduces the incidence of hyaline membranes disease and respiratory distress in the group that had significant impact in terms of absence. But about 50 percent death rate was reduced with regard to this effect in other studies suggest that treatment with dexamethasone, even in case of imminent delivery of a dose as being a routine procedure in preterm deliveries be used.

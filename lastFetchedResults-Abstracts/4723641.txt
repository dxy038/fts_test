A novel approach for synthesis of multiple objective reconfigurable control is proposed based on the robust control mixer method proposed by Yang et al. (2000). This new approach considers not only the recovery of the input/output functionality but also the recovery of desired system performance. Once the desired system performance can be described by a LTI system form, the robust techniques, such as H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control theory, can be directly employed for synthesis of these dynamical control mixer modules. The case study based on a robot benchmark subjected to failures shows that the proposed method and its extension lead to better performance recovery compared with other related methods.

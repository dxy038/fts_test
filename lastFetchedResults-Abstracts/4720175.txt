Performance of London´s traffic control and monitoring systems (TCMS) is world class with well over 90% Availability of CCTV, safety cameras, tunnel control equipment and variable message signs and over 99% Availability of traffic signals. &#8220;Availability&#8221; is simply defined as the percentage of time the equipment or system is performing according to its functional specification. High Availability is key to reducing congestion, allowing network operators to manage the network and improving the urban environment. Excellence in management of the TCMS is fundamental to TfL´s objective of &#8220;Keeping London Moving&#8221;.

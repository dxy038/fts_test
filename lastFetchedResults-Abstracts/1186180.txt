This work deals with the virtual simulation of the sheet metal stamping process. The main objective is to predict when and where the cracks can appear in the workpiece during the forming operation. A local approach based on the strong coupling between anisotropic elastoplasticity with mixed nonlinear work hardening (isotropic and kinematic) and an isotropic ductile damage is proposed. The theoretical and numerical aspects of the constitutive equations are, first, presented. The resolution of the resulting system of equations is carried out via a Vumat user material, using ABAQUS/Explicit finite element code. The results obtained, in the context of Swiftâ€™s benchmark deep-drawing test show the efficiency and the potential interest of the proposed damage model.

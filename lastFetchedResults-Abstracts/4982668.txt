The paper describes method for calculation of stator component of stray-load losses in a high-speed induction motor using removed rotor test. Specifically designed high-speed induction motor shows excessive losses already in removed rotor regime. The objective of the paper is to find the origin of such losses, calculate them and make a comparison with experimentally obtained results

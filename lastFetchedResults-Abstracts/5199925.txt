The objective of this paper is to study facility location problems under a hybrid uncertain environment involving randomness and fuzziness. A two-stage fuzzy random facility location model with recourse is developed in which the demands and the costs are assumed to be fuzzy random variables. As in general the fuzzy random parameters in the model can be regarded as continuous fuzzy random variables with infinite realizations, the computation of the recourse requires solving infinite second-stage programming problems. Owing to this fact, the recourse function cannot be calculated analytically, which implies that the model cannot benefit from the use of methods of classical mathematical programming. In order to solve the location problems of this nature, we first develop techniques of fuzzy random simulation. In the sequel, by combining the fuzzy random simulation, simplex algorithm and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), a hybrid algorithm is proposed to solve the two-stage fuzzy random facility location model. Finally, an illustrative numerical example is provided.

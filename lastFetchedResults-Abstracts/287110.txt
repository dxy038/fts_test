PURPOSE:  Continuous monitoring of health determinants in populations is necessary to predict future disease burdens. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalences of major risk factors for lifestyle diseases for 8 years (1993 to 2000) in representative samples of the general population.

METHODS: Independent cross-sectional surveys representative of adults aged 35 to 74 years (4,228 men and 4,190 women) in Geneva, Switzerland, conducted continuously between 1993 and 2000.

RESULTS: Prevalence of hypertension decreased 15% in men and 10% in women (trend p's<.0001), while overweight/obesity prevalences increased 10% in men and 8% in women (trend p's<.05). The prevalences of smoking (men: 29%; women: 24%) and physical inactivity (men: 44%; women: 50%) remained high and unchanged, and the dietary unsaturated/saturated fat ratio did not change (men: 0.40; women: 0.48).

CONCLUSIONS: Because of the persistent high prevalence of risk factors, the global burden of chronic diseases is likely to grow in the next decade and beyond. Continuous monitoring provides reliable trends, beyond seasonal and sampling variations.

Mobile payment is considered as the accelerator of e- and m-commerce. In this paper we propose an innovative system model for mobile payment based on the existing models. The novel model focuses on the enhancement of privacy and non-repudiation. It introduces trusted third elements and follows new mechanism to achieve this objective. Moreover we design a protocol with regard to the model and discuss the corresponding privacy in this architecture. The accountability implemented by the protocol is proved by formal analysis

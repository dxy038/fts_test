IP switching is a new routing technology proposed to improve the performance of IP routers. In this paper, we study the performance modeling and analysis of IP switching. Our proposed performance models can be used to evaluate the percentage of flows switched and the ratio of the switched path delay to the forwarded path delay in an IP switch. Based on these models, the impacts of different system parameters on the performance are also investigated. Our objective is to develop a design tool for IP switches

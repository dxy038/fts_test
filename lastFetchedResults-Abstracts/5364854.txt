This paper discusses a set of criteria for a new definition of powers flowing into nonsinusoidal circuits, to satisfy a set of criteria. This leads to a new concept of unidirectional, bidirectional and total power as a function of time and a new idea of effective power as the integral over the time. The idea presented is illustrated by a case study providing comparison with three existing power definitions. Although the concept presented does not solve ad problems with power definitions in nonsinusoidal circuits, it can be useful in some cases

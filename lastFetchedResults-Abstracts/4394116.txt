This paper addresses the design and dynamic analysis of a new generation of fluidic elastomer actuators (FEAs) that offer bidirectional bending developed as motion segments of a pressure-operated soft robotic snake. Our prior work on FEAs has identified a number of limitations, namely a high center of gravity, narrow base, slow dynamics, and a small range of pressure inputs. We developed two versions of FEAs based on an improved design concept with different geometric parameters and characterized their dynamic response under a custom visual tracking system. Compared with the previous actuators, the FEAs developed in this work offer robust operation, safety at larger input pressure values, faster response, lower center of gravity and a flat bottom for better compatibility for snake-like undulatory locomotion.

Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) have gained significant attention in academic community by involving aspects of product lines and runtime adaptable systems development. Managing dynamic variations demands is a challenge addressed by DSPL paradigm. In this context, this paper introduces the results of a systematic literature review that involved 2,084 studies, with the objective of understanding how the dynamic derivation in DSPL is made. The contributions of this study are: a) an embracing analysis and classification of scientific literature in DSPL area, b) the definition of inputs that are needed to perform the dynamic derivation, c) the description of what composes these inputs, and d) the understanding of the process to perform the dynamic derivation. We conclude that due to the lack of maturity in the dynamic derivation field, there are many open research opportunities still available.

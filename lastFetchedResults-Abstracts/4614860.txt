The objective of this study is the development of an auto-navigation system which supports activities of the visually impaired without help of others. This system navigates the subject by using information about three sensors (acceleration sensor, terrestrial magnetism sensor and gyro sensor), DGPS (differential Global Positioning System), maps and a traffic data base. In our navigation system, after inputting the destination, the position of the user is estimated, the most suitable route to the destination is calculated, and the user is guided along this route. We assess the developed method which estimates the movement of the subject.

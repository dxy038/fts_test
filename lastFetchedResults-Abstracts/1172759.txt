Soil compaction which results from soil agricultural machinery traffic, changes hydraulic and pores of soil properties, thus influences root growth, and water and solute transport through the soil. Therefore knowledge of the properties of active soil water conductive pores is important. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of compaction on soil hydraulic properties, included porosity, number of meso and macropores and also contribution of pores to the water flux in soil. For this purpose, the soil hydraulic parameters were measured using a disk infiltrometer at 14, 4, 1 and 0 cm water pressure suction at a silty loam soil in a field experiment. The treatments included control (no tractor passes), 2 and 4 tractor passes. The results showed that in control treatement, meso and macropores in the upper layer were present, while in the other two treatments, because of compaction caused by passing tractor, macro and mesopores were both destroyed and decreased. In spite of the very low macroposity volume, in all three treatments, macropores were the main effective pores for water flow.

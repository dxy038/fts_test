The miniaturization of electron devices has its advantages in dense circuits and high frequency devices. As can be seen in the current literature, considerable effort is devoted on the problem miniaturizing modern electronic devices to allow high speed and high density. Considering the effects in short channel metal oxide semiconductor field transistors (MOSFET), in practice the device is scaled to preserve the long-channel characteristics after miniaturization. Several parameters are chosen and their sensitivity analysis is used for the miniaturization of a MOSFET. The objective is to miniaturize the device in such away to avoid the break down effects at high bias. A finite element based constrained inverse problem methodology is used for the first time for the miniaturization of a MOSFET device

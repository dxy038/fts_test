Objective(s): This study was to investigate the potential anti-diabetic effects of alcoholic extract of Salvia hydrangea in rats.
Materials and Methods:Thirty five male Wistar rats were divided into five groups namely non-diabetic control, diabetic control, and three experimental diabetic that received either Salvia hydrangea extract for 21 days at the doses of 100 and 200 or glibenclamide at the dose of 10 mg/kg through gavage feeding. To induce diabetes, streptozotocin was injected intraperitoneally.
Results:Insulin and HDL levels in the group receiving the high dose of the extract showed significant increase, whereas the amount of cholesterol in rats that received glibenclamide and the extract showed a significant decrease as compared to the diabetic control group (P<0.05). The blood glucose levels showed significant reduction in all experimental groups (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Consumption of the extract of the aerial parts of S. hydrangea which reduces blood fat and increases insulin may have beneficial effects on the symptoms of diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

Background: Antioxidants are compounds that protect the body against cell membrane injury or damage to the cell’s genetic material from free radical activity. The objective of this research was to study the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of various extracts from the seeds and aerial parts of Malcolmia africana (L.) R. Br. 
Materials and Methods: The overall results of M. africana tests allowed us to study the various extracts [hexane extract (HE), methanol extract (ME) and chloroform extract (CE)] of the test total phenolic, ABTS [(2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid))] and DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl) and also to test B-carotene, largest property antioxidant. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts of both samples was determined against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
Results: The amount of total phenolics was highest in the methanol extract (ME) of the seeds (225.19±0.02) and aerial parts (208.52±0.012 mg) Gallic acid/gr sub-fractions. The property antioxidant shows both of the mechanisms of electron transfer and the hydrogen transfer which the extracts has gone through.
Conclusion: This investigation showed that ME has the highest antioxidant behavior. The antimicrobial activities of the extracts of both samples were determined against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The bioassay shows that the seeds and aerial parts exhibit moderate antimicrobial activity. Therefore, the extracts could be suitable as antimicrobial and anti-oxidative agents in the food industry.

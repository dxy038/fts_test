Objective
To study differences in treatment and early morbidity and mortality in relation to gender, type of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and age in patients under 80 years of age.
Methods

We studied 1744 consecutive patients with ACS with assumed decreasing order of severity [ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI), non-ST-elevation MI and unstable angina of high- and low-risk types] admitted to the coronary care unit at Sahlgrenska University Hospital.
Results

The use of thrombolysis and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) did not differ significantly between gender groups and women did not suffer from more severe complications than men. Treatment with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and aspirin was used on a similar scale among women and men. In-hospital complications and use of intravenous drugs were strongly associated with severity of disease in a similar way among women and men. The mortality rates at 30 days were 12.4% and 7.4% in MI with and without ST-segment elevation, but only 1.3% and 1.0% in unstable angina of high- and low-risk types. The use of primary PCI decreased with age, as did coronary angiography and PCI in the subacute phase, irrespective of gender.
Conclusion

Among patients <80 years with ACS admitted to a coronary care unit, the suspicion that women are treated less aggressively than men could not be verified. Nor did women suffer from more complications or have a significantly higher 30-day mortality than men. Elderly patients were significantly less likely to undergo invasive procedures than those of a younger age, irrespective of gender.

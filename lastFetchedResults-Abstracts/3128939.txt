According to current logistics forecast research both at home and abroad, regression analysis and exponential smoothing are of easy computation but unsatisfactory computational accuracy. Gray forecast, grey Markov model and neural network etc. are of high computational accuracy but the course of computation is comparatively complicated. Herein, the author introduce the curve of growth theory, a new quantitative method, to make demand forecast of the logistics parks. High-computation accuracy can be obtained through rather simple computation. After analysis to application of the forecasting model of logistic curve in logistic demand forecast is made, it has been brought forward that growth variation of the logistic park is in accordance with the logistic curve. Therefore, it is feasible to make demand forecast of the logistic park with logistic curve model, which has also been verified by computation examples. Finally, objective evaluation on application of logistic curve in demand forecast of logistic park was made in the text.

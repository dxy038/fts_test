The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOs) was established in 1984 and marks its 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year. In this coming November, the 18<sup>th</sup> CEOs plenary, which will be held in Beijing, is planning to hold the memorial event during the same week. The main objective of CEOs is technical coordination and information exchange of Earth observation satellite systems. The space agency of each country participates in CEOs and discusses Earth observation related standards, the international intelligence infrastructure, development plans and cooperation so that the observation is properly planned to avoid unneeded overlap and to fill the gap of capability. As for Japan. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)/JAXA is a member of CEOs and held the 15<sup>th</sup> CEOs plenary in Kyoto as a chair.

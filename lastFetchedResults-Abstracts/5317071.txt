A man-machine integrated control system is presented as the next step in automotive electronic control. In this connection, it is necessary to study ways of managing vehicle dynamics and human factors. To improve the relationship between the driverÂ´s perceptions and vehicle motion, a subjective control system with a humanlike processor is expected to play a large role instead of the conventional objective one. Novel technologies, such as advanced control theory, artificial intelligence, fuzzy theory, and neural networks, will be utilized in this humanlike processor

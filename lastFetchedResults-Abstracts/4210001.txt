With the commercial availability of SiC BJT and MOSFET, their acceptance are expected grows in consideration to the excellent low switching loss, high temperature operation and high voltage rating capabilities of these devices. The objective of this paper is to assess the performance of bidirectional SiC switch devices within matrix converter. Two 2-phase to 1-phase matrix converters will be constructed with SiC BJT and SiC MOSFET. The improved performance of the SiC switch devices is assessed with reference to measured switching waveforms. Furthermore, the effect of two different SiC switch devices on the overall performance of the matrix converter in high frequency and temperature with particular attention to power circuit losses is investigated.

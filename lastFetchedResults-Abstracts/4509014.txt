Applying the method based on Petri net can join knowledge expression and diagnosis reasoning together. Firstly, the symptomatic places reflecting failures were established for the original places and the fault places causing failures were established for the objective places. Then, by prior searching in depth and maximal searching in reliability, the optimum routes from the original place sets to the objective place sets were set up. In reasoning based on Petri net, by a series of matrix calculation for the status vector recurrence, the quick diagnosing results could be got. The conclusion inferred by the Petri net reasoning was consistent with the facts. It suits for the status monitoring and fault diagnosing of modern machining processes and systems

Changing Childbirth has been a central focus of maternity care policy in England. The objective of this study was to determine whether different professional groups involved in maternity care—hospital and community midwives, general practitioners and obstetricians—had different professional attitudes to a local implementation scheme. Data were obtained using a postal questionnaire, based on an agenda developed from focus groups. Whilst general practitioners appeared to be somewhat less optimistic than were midwives, there existed clear differences of opinion within the midwifery profession itself, depending upon whether the midwife worked in the community or in hospital. All professionals appeared conscious of the gap between the service ideals and the limited resources available to achieve them, and expressed uncertainty over future directions and ways of working.

This paper studies the feasibility of using a solar-powered liquid desiccant system to meet both building cooling and fresh water needs in Beirut humid climate using parabolic solar concentrators as a heat source for regenerating the liquid desiccant. The water condensate is captured from the air leaving the regenerator. An integrated model of solar-powered calcium chloride liquid desiccant system for air dehumidification/humidification is developed. The LDS model predicted the amount of condensate obtained from the humid air leaving the regenerator bed when directed through a coil submerged in cold sea water. An optimization problem is formulated for selection and operation of a LDS to meet fresh water requirement and air conditioning load at minimal energy cost for a typical residential space in the Lebanon coastal climate with conditioned area of 80 m2 with the objective of producing 15 l of fresh drinking water a day and meet air conditioning need of residence at minimum energy cost. The optimal regeneration temperature increases with decreased heat sink temperature with values of 50.5 째C and 52 째C corresponding to sink temperatures of 19 째C and 16 째C.

Shunt static capacitor banks are frequently an economical means of maintaining voltage levels under conditions of heavy load or transformer, line, and generation outages. This paper treats the allocation of capacitor banks as a discrete programming problem in which the objective is to minimize capital outlay for the banks required to control voltages under all anticipated contingencies.

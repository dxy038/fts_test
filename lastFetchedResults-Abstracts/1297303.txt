This paper proposes a satisfying optimization method based on goal programming for fuzzy multiple objective optimization problem. The aim of this presented approach is to make the more important objective achieving the higher desirable satisfying degree. For different fuzzy relations and fuzzy importance, the reformulated optimization models based on goal programming is proposed. Not only the satisfying results of all the objectives can be acquired, but also the fuzzy importance requirement can be simultaneously actualized. The balance between optimization and relative importance is realized. We demonstrate the efficiency, flexibility and sensitivity of the proposed method by numerical examples.

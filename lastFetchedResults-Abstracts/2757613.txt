The objective of this paper is to evaluate the novel method for analyzing the nonlinear correlation of the uterine electromyography (EMG). The application of this method may improve monitoring in pregnancy, labor detection, and preterm labor detection. Uterine EMG signals recorded from a 4 &#215; 4 matrix of electrodes on the subjectsÂ´ abdomen are used here. The propagation was analyzed using the nonlinear correlation coefficient <i>h</i><sup>2</sup>. Signals from 49 women (36 during pregnancy and 13 in labor) at different gestational age were used. ROC curves were computed to evaluate the potential of three methods to differentiate between 174 contractions recorded during pregnancy and 115 contractions recorded during labor. The results indicate considerably better performance of the nonlinear correlation analysis (area under curve = 0.85) when compared to classical frequency parameters (area under curve = 0.76 and 0.66) in distinguishing labor contractions from normal pregnancy contractions. We conclude that the analysis of the propagation of the uterine electrical activity using the nonlinear correlation coefficient <i>h</i><sup>2</sup> is a promising way of improving the usefulness of uterine EMG signals for clinical purposes, such as monitoring in pregnancy, labor detection, and prediction of preterm labor.

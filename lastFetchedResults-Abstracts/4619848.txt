With based-data of DOM and vector data in land change survey and the research object of emphasis land class, we can establish an accurate, rapid and objective data validity evaluation system based on remote sensing to evaluate the validity of the updated data quantitatively in land change survey to second land survey in the future. This paper researched two main aspects, just as follows: the principle and basis of evaluation index, and the data processing procedures based on different evaluation index. We also explored the multi-factor compound assessment model of the thematic data based on data validity evaluation system of land change survey. In this research, we choose the case area in Yijiadu Town, Hunan Province, china, and cultivated land as the research object, to evaluate the validity of land change survey data quantitatively based on area ratio index. In this process, we have realized an integrated and automatic work mechanism, including remote sensing data processing, internal analysis, evaluation index generation, and auto-detection.

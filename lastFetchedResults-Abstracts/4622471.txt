Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) Kit for teaching and learning is developed based on the existing PLC Trainer that is not able to achieve the objective and learning outcome in enhancing the hands on skill aspect through circuit designing, installation and trouble shooting. The existing PLC trainer board comes with a casing where students have the difficulty in observing and understanding the connection between the input module, PLC controller and output modules. The development of PLC Kit has been designed and improved by increasing the number of input and output components, cost reduction and it is also user friendly. This PLC Kit is embedded with I/O module such as normally open push buttons, 24VDC motor, 24VDC relay, 24VDC solenoid cylinder and 24VDC lamp. This PLC Kit can be interfaced to various types of PLC controller such as Omron, Siemens and Panasonic (NAIS). Based on students Lab Practical Assessment record, it is found that there is 39% improvement of knowledge and hands on skill when students use the PLC Kit.

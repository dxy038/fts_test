Summary form only given. The Center for Electromechanics at The University of Texas at Austin has designed, fabricated, and is testing a prototype 20-T on-axis, single-turn, toroidal-field (TF) coil. The objective of the diagnostic system for the prototype 20-T, TF coil is to determine displacements, temperatures, and magnetic fields at various locations in the coil. The values are then compared to predictions by the electromagnetic (EM) analysis to validate computational results. F.W. Bell Hall (BHT-921) probes are used to map the toroidal magnetic field through the thickness of a single TF plate and in the radial and axial directions for a given circumferential plane. Current Rogowski integrators measure current in each of the six 60&amp;deg; sectors. Thermocouples are used to measure temperatures at various points in the coil. Strain gauge data are used to determine strain conditions during the pulse as well as the uniformity of the applied axial preload prior to the pulse. Due to the anticipated problems with EM interference in the strain gauges, a simple fiber-optic sensor has been developed to measure strain in the extreme thermal and magnetic environment

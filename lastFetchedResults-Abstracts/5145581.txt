As the source of the modern enterprise value chain, purchasing value drives the value updated and added constantly. Based on construction supply chain, the origin of the purchasing value was analyzed from three dimensions which consist of materials value, suppliers value, and social value in this paper. A multi-objective linear programming model was proposed and solved by the fuzzy mathematics. Meanwhile by the application of the model based on the example of EHDC procurement, the distribution result kept with the purchasing intention of the owner. Compared to the traditional purchasing model which was just to control the cost as the core, the order quantities was distributed according to materials value, suppliers value, and social value further in this model.

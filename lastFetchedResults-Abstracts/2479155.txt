<p><strong>Objective:</strong>To determine the possible association between the M235T variant of angiotensinogen gene and preeclampsia in Iranian preeclamtic women with hypertension during pregnancy. <strong>Mand methods:</strong>During a case control study, we used polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis to investigate the association between M235T polymorphism in preeclamtic women compared to normotensive controls.<br /><strong>Results:</strong>The M235T polymorphism was significantly associated with increased preeclampsia risk in the studied population as supported by a p value of 0.017 and chi-square value of 8.12. The frequency of mutated allele and genotype distribution showed a significant difference between preeclamtic women and control groups.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong>The result indicates that the AGT M235T polymorphism plays a significant role in preeclampsia observed in selected Iranian preeclamtic women, and it can be considered as a major risk factor for preeclampsia.</p>

In this paper, adaptive tuning strategies for Near Field Communication (NFC) transmitter module are investigated. The objective is to perform auto-adjustment of the matching network associated with the transmitter antenna in order to compensate the influence of the receiver antenna. Two different strategies are studied, aiming at maintaining a constant emitted magnetic field or a constant current consumption.

This paper proposes a new method for transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) with Multi-objective Memetic Algorithm (MOMA). Recently, the new environment such as power network liberalization and distributed generation brings about uncertainties in power system operation and planning. The importance of improving power supply reliability with probabilistic approaches is of main concern. This paper formulates TNEP as a multi-objective optimization problem that optimizes probabilistic reliability index as well as the construction cost to obtain a set of the Pareto solutions through Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). This paper proposes a new method for TNEP with MOMA that combines Multi-objective meta-heuristics (MOMH) with Tabu Search (TS) to obtain better solution sets. The effectiveness of the proposed method is successfully demonstrated in the IEEE 24-bus system.

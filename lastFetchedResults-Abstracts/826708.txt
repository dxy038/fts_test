In this paper, we presented the multi-item inventory control model whose objectives are minimizing total cost and minimizing the number of manpower. This model is formulated under four constraints consisting of storage spaces, budgetary, allowable shortage quantities and periodic order quantities. The last two constraints are considered as interval. In the presented model, shortage is allowable and lead-time is zero. The parameters such as demands, costs (including: setting, maintenance, shortage) and constraint resources are fuzzy. The type of fuzzy numbers in demand & cost is triangular and the numbers of constraint resources are positive trapezoid. In solution methodology, first we converted the cost objective and manpower objective functions to six objective functions and then reduced fuzzy constraints to crisp constraints via defuzzification. Then we solved the resulted crisp multi objective model using Fuzzy Non Linear Programming (FNLP). Finally we presented a numerical example to solve and describe the model applying Lingo software package.

The study objective is to propose a simple and efficient evaluation method. The groundwater pollutant sources were analyzed and the 20 groundwater samples &amp; 34 chemical indexes were tested in Huainan mining area. Based on analytic testing results, the groundwater quality was evaluated with the method of fuzzy mathematical comprehensive evaluation, and pollution degree was proposed. The results indicate that the most groundwater has been polluted in research area, especially in coal mining industry center and utility area, which occupy 65% pollutions according to the evaluation criteria.

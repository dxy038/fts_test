In this paper, we present an optimum design of two-hand Finite Impulse Response (FiR) Quadrature Mirror Filter hank (QMF) based upon max-flat polynomial for maximum possible discrimination between textured images. There are several applications which may not require reconstruction of signal from its transformed coefficients e.g. texture analysis, remote sensing etc. For such applications, features are extracted at different frequency resolution scales. Therefore, it is extremely important that transformed image coefficients should be distortion less. In view of the fact, that in practice, it is impossible to obtain error free coefficients, we present an optimal design method for maximum possible discrimination between any particular class of textures with minimum possible coefficient error. This method employs pass-band response and transition width of a filter as an objective function to design an optimum filter bank.

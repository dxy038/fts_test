With more and more applications using biometrics, new privacy and security risks arise. Some new biometric systems have been proposed in the last decade following a privacy by design approach: cancelable biometric systems. Their evaluation is still an open issue in research. The objective of this paper is first to define an evaluation methodology for these particular biometric systems by proposing some metrics for testing their robustness. Second, we show through the example of a cancelable biometric system using finger-knuckle-prints how some privacy properties can be checked by simulating attacks.

The main objective of this paper is to focus on the designing of helical antenna in the High Frequency (HF) range from 3 MHz to 30 MHz. Several parameters dimension and helicalÂ´s profiles were studied in order to obtained a suitable resonance frequency. Among the helical antenna parameters that being studied were on its different forms that link to multiple diameters, radius ratio, and number of turns. The software used for the simulation is the CST Microwave Studio (CST MWS) which is an analytical tool that provides an accurate 3D EM simulation results for high frequency design. The helical antenna was constructed, enables the comparison of results to be analyzed. From the design, the ldquoreturn lossesrdquo were obtained.

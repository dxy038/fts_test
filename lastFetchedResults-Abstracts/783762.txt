Objective To examine associations between childhood
psychopathology and family factors at age 8, and sense of
coherence (SOC) at age 18.
Methods The sample includes 2,314 Finnish boys born
1981 with information about psychopathology from parents
and teachers using Rutter scales, and self-reports of
depressive symptoms using Child Depression Inventory
(CDI), and self-reports of SOC at age 18.
Results Low parental education level and living in other
than two biological parent family at age 8 were associated
with low SOC 10 years later. Boys with internalizing
symptoms based on parent/teacher reports, and depressive
symptoms based on self-reports at age 8 were at risk for
lower SOC at follow-up. Comorbidity of internalizing and
conduct problems had the strongest association with low
SOC.
Conclusion The study shows that internalizing symptoms,
comorbid conduct and emotional problems, low
parental education level and nonintact family at age 8
predict low SOC at age 18. Future research whether universal,
selective or indicated early interventions targeted on
risk factors of childhood mental health problems may result
in promotion of well-being (including good SOC) in early
adulthood is warranted.

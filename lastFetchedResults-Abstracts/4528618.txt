WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a promising technology which can offer high speed voice, video and data services upto the requirements at the customerÂ´s end. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of a WiMAX system in the presence of Adjacent channel interference under No diversity case and Selection combining diversity employing different adaptive transmission policies. The WiMAX system incorporates OFDM with QPSK modulation as the transmission scheme. Simulated results of the estimated channel capacity show that the implementation of Optimal power and rate adaptation policy is highly effective to combat adjacent channel interference in the WiMAX communication system under Selection combining.

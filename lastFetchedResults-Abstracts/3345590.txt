This paper synthetically considers community resident´s satisfaction, community resident´s priority, delivery efficiency of resource suppliers and equilibrium matching in the case of multiple community service demand, and establishes a multiple objective community service resources matching model with priority in view of M community residents, L service and N suppliers. Then it gives a solution algorithm based on hierarchical optimization. Because of the problems existing in the community service resources and the computational complexity of the solution algorithm, a simple and quick heuristic solution algorithm is proposed. Finally a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the solution algorithm.

Materials & Methods: The Quasi-Experimental study conducted on 330 Hamedanian women in case and witness groups (randomly selected) in 1386. In case group, education was done based on James Brown education pattern and the witness group took part in education class in clinic. Data analysis was done by SPSS11 software, Chi-square and T.test formulas. The amount of meaningful statistical was P < 0.05. 
Results: Knowledge average scales in case group, including sexual health, anatomy and physiology, diverse aspects of sexual health and awareness of AIDS, STDs and family planning, after education with James Brown pattern increase (81.7 , 78.6, 84.0, 85.9) rather than pre-education stage (44, 45.8, 49.3, 43) (P=0.00). While knowledge average scale in witness group before and after education has no meaningful statistical difference (P=0.62).

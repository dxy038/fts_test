This paper proposes a Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) based on the phase-plane fuzzy logic control to improve the power oscillation damping of a wide-area power system control. The proposed phase-plane fuzzy logic control is applied to the two-area four-machine interconnected power system where the TCSC is installed in series with the transmission line. The objective of the proposed controller is to make the power oscillations more stable and robust due to uncertainty from the delay time of the communication system in a wide-area control. In order to verify the performance of the proposed control, the proposed controller is compared with the lead-lag compensator optimally tuned by GA. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller can enhance the controller performance and robustness under the large communication delay time and various operating conditions.

Optimization problems with bilinear matrix inequalities (BMI) constraints arise frequently in automatic control and are difficult to solve due to the inherent nonconvexity. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the spectral SDP (semidefinite programming) method presented by Thevenetet al. (2004), along with practical information on how to basically use specSDP, a software designed to solve LMI/BMI-constrained optimization problems, with a linear or quadratic objective function. specSDP is a Fortran code, interfaced with Matlab. It is tested here against several examples of reduced order control problems from the benchmark collection COMPlib (Leibfritz and Lipinsky, 2003).

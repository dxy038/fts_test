The objective of the present study was to evaluate the beneficial effect of hCG injected immediately after mating in Arabian barren mares treated with uterine lavage and oxytocin. Arabian barren mares (n = 36) with PMIE were subjected to detailed clinical examinations including palpation per rectum, vaginoscopy, and cytological examination. After mating the 36 mares were randomly divided into four groups. The mares in group 1 (n = 10) were immediately after breeding injected with hCG 3000 IU IM. Uterine lavage with 1 L of N-saline containing 4 million IU of crystalline penicillin and 4 g of streptomycin sulphate was performed 4 h after breeding. Then mares received two injections of oxytocin 40 IU IM 2 h apart after 6 h of mating. Mares in group 2 (n = 10) treated with uterine lavage and oxytocin as group 1. While mares in group 3 (n = 10) received uterine lavage only. A control group (n = 6) as group 4 did not received any treatment. The results of clinical examination indicated that 69.4% of PMIE mares were harboring severe endometritis and 30.6% with a moderate form of endometritis. Significant (P &lt; 0.01) increase in lymphocytes were founded in barren mares included in this study. Higher pregnancy rate (P &lt; 0.01) was founded in Arabian barren mares 80% injected with hCG immediately after breeding and uterine lavage and oxytocin. No significant difference was found in mares received uterine lavage and oxytocin and uterine lavage only. In a conclusion, administration of hCG immediately after mating and intrauterine lavage containing antibiotics performed 4 h and two injections of oxytocin 40 IU IM 2 h apart after 6 h of mating had improved fertility of Arabian barren mares.

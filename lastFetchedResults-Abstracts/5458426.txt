Increasing number of service and manufacturing sectors are investigating the impact of information technology (IT) and information system (IS) on organizations. Also, IT training programs and their role in IS environment are being investigated. Previous studies suggested IT impact measurement for planning and assigning IT end-user training programs. This article develops and implements an integrated model to plan IT end-user training programs based on past IT end-user training programs success results specially IT impacts on individual works. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and integer programming techniques are used to achieve the objective of this study. Previous studies either utilize qualitative measurements or DEA, whereas this study utilizes an integrated qualitative-DEA-integer programming model for planning and optimizing end-user training programs in context of IT/IS. The integrated DEA-integer programming model of this study ensures budget allocation for IT/IS resources achieve the goals and profits of organizations and their sub-organizations. The integrated model is applied to a large gas refinery composed of six major departments and 450 personnel. The result of implementing the proposed model shows its superiority and applicability.

Objective: This study assessed the effects of computer games and computer assisted typing instructions on spelling scores of primary school children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: In this single blind clinical trial, 37 primary school children with ADHD were assigned to group 1 (n=17) and group 2 (n=20). The children in group 1 played computer games in 8 one-hour sessions (three times a week), while the children in group 2 received 8 one-hour sessions of typing instructions (three times a week). Twelve school's spelling scores were obtained; pre-, intra-, and post-intervention, each four scores. Eight session' s spelling scores were also recorded. Results: The two groups were matched for age, school grade, gender, IQ, medications, parents' and teachers' Conner's score, having a personal computer at home, experience of working with the computer, and average spelling scores. After taking sessions of computer games, intra-intervention school's spelling scores (17.93 ± 0.03) showed a significant borderline increase in comparison to the pre-intervention scores (17.25±3.26). The typing instructions sessions made no difference. Conclusion: Improvement in the mean spelling scores of the primary school students with ADHD during sessions of computer games can be due to improvement of their attention. The interesting format of these games, fast feedback, absence of negative feedback, and their supporting the decision making in children can also explain this finding.

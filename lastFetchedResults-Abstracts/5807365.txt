We consider a special mode of production which is called make-to-order, because the traditional modes of production no longer meet the diversified and personalized needs of customers. In this context, we propose a muti-objective optimizations model in MTO scheduling. The objective of the model is to seek the minimum cost of among production idle time, tardiness or earliness penalty and the maximum completion time of an order. In the constraint we add the priority between the production processes in order to ensure the quality of product delivery. We find that production efficiency, delivery satisfaction and equipment utilization are achieved in this model. We develop insights into how companies respond quickly to market changes and bring good economic benefit to the production company.

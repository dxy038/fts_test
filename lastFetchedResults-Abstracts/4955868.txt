This paper presents the prototype of a mixed reality system using the computer controlled dental milling machine, which is called MRD Mill. First, overview of the core dental milling machine developed in this study is presented, showing its kinematics and mechanisms to achieve the objective of the dental treatment. Then the paper covers its basic functions, including joystick-based control, NC code-based control, manipulation recording, and replay operation for the manual manipulation. MRD Mill system was installed with a mixed reality technology using the dental milling machine as the core unit. MRD Mill system is designed to support the operation of the dental mill using the mixed reality technology. This paper shows superimpose of trajectory of cutting tool path and virtual objects over the physical model. Then discussion and future direction will be followed.

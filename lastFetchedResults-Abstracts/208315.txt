Background and Objective: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a monoclonal proliferation of
lymphocytes mainly B cells (B-CLl) in the blood and bone marrow. Morphological and functional abnormalities ofT
cells and monoclonality of them have been documented in eLL. Suchexpanded cells may be specific for recognition of
pathogens. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is most likely involved in this phenomenon in CLL. CMV infection causes a high
level of immune response in immunodeficient patients. In this study, the associationbetween expanded T cells andthe
immune responsesofCMV-specific C04+ andCDS+ cells in B-CLLwas investigated.
Matherials and Methods: This was a cross sectional study and the study group were 41 CMV seropositive B-CLL
patients and 35 CMV seropositive healthy donors (control group). The level of Clvlv-specific C04' and COS' cells
immune responses were detected by intracellular cytokine response to .entigenic activation and CMV tetramer
respectively.
Results: The level of CMV-specific CD4+ cel1s responseswas significantly higherin patientswith a medianof 10.99%
and II % for lFN-r and TNF-a producing CD4+T cells respectively than age-matched controls with a median of4.3%
and 4.6 (IF 0.0001 for IFN-r and P" 0.003 for TNF-a). The level ofCMV-specilic CDS' cells immune responses was
also higher in patients compared to control group (p= 0.03 forNLV). Therewas a positive correlation betweenthe level
ofC04' and CDS' cells immune responses (p='0.OO9).
Conclusions: These results show the deep influence of CMV infection and the immune response to it in T-eel1
alteration inCLL patients. The increased level of CMV-specificT eells may be the cause of increased level of absolute
T cells in these patients.

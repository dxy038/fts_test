BACKGROUND: Despite exercise is recommended as an adjunct to medication therapy in
patients with heart failure (HF), non-adherence to exercise is a major problem. While improving
self-efficacy is an effective way to increase physical activity, the evidence concerning the
relationship between strategies to enhance self-efficacy and exercise among HF has not been
systematically reviewed. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the effect of
interventions to change the self-efficacy on exercise in patients with HF.
METHODS: A systematic database search was conducted for articles reporting exercise selfefficacy
interventions. Databases such as PubMed, ProQuest, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO,
and the Cochrane Library were searched with restrictions to the years 2000-June 2014. A search
of relevant databases identified 10 studies. Published randomized controlled intervention
studies focusing strategies to change self-efficacy to exercise adherence in HF were eligible for
inclusion. In addition, studies that have applied self-efficacy-based interventions to improve
exercise are discussed.
RESULTS: Limited published data exist evaluating the self-efficacy strategies to improve exercise
in HF. Dominant strategies to improve patientsâ€™ self-efficacy were performance
accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, emotional arousal.
CONCLUSION: Evidence from some trials supports the view that incorporating the theory of selfefficacy
into the design of an exercise intervention is beneficial. Moreover, exercise interventions
aimed at integrating the four strategies of exercise self-efficacy can have positive effects on
confidence and the ability to initiate exercise and recover HF symptoms. Findings of this study
suggest that a positive relationship exists between self-efficacy and initiating and maintaining
exercise in HF, especially in the short-term period.

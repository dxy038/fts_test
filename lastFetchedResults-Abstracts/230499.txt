A new optimizing objective (three-dimensional power distribution control) for the load-following problem in nuclear reactor is presented. To realize such an objective, a combination of Harmonic Synthesis Method and Nodal Method has been practiced on the numeric calculation for optimizing problem on the 200 MW Heating Reactor, in which the control rods serve as the only control variables. In contrast, most of the load-following problems have been solved under a one-dimensional neutron model. And it seems that such a model is not suitable for the reactor core whose power was controlled only by control rods. In this case, the control rod causes a strong absorption of neutron in a local area thus makes the radial power distribution play a much more important role in the load-following process. As the 3-dimensional model is used and the corresponding method is performed, both of the total power level and power distribution are controlled well. For example, the power peak-factor is lower about 4% than that with one-dimensional method.

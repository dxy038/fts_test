In this communication, an attempt has been made to find out the convective heat transfer coefficient for active solar distillation system. It is a well-known fact that the distillate output (the yield) decreases significantly with the increase of water depth in the basin of the solar still. It is also known that more yield is obtained in case of active solar distillation system as compared to passive solar still due to higher temperature difference between the water and inner glass cover temperatures in the active mode. For the present study, experiments have been conducted for 24 hours during winter months for different water depths in the basin (0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 m) for passive as well as active solar distillation system. The objective of the present paper is to study the effect of different water depths in the basin on the heat and mass transfer coefficients. It is inferred that the convective heat transfer coefficient between water and inner condensing cover depends significantly on the water depth in the basin. It is also observed that more yield is obtained during the off shine hours as compared to daytime for higher water depths in solar still (0.10 m and 0.15 m) due to storage effect.

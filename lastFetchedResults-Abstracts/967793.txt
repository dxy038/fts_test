Introduction: Apart from glucose, insulin release is stimulated or suppressed by some hormones and neural signs. Ghrelin is a gut hormone that stimulates growth hormone (GH) secretion, and recent studies have suggested its role in insulin secretion. The objective of this study was to determine baseline insulinâ€™s relationship to ghrelin and GH concentration in asthma males.
Methods: In this study, we measured the baseline blood levels of serum ghrelin and GH in adult obese males with mild to moderate asthma and assessed their relationship with serum insulin and pancreatic beta- cell function. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between insulin and other variables. 
Results: A significant negative correlation was found between fasting serum insulin and both ghrelin and GH concentration. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between the beta- cell function and both serum ghrelin and GH (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Our study findings demonstrated that in adult asthma patients, an increase in serum ghrelin and GH is accompanied by a decrease in serum insulin secretion, and the measuring of serum ghrelin or GH is a predictor of blood insulin level in these patients.

The recently reported voltage-source converter type matrix power converter offers advantages in terms of employing the well-known and proven technology of the three-phase voltage-source power converters, bypassing the switching difficulties associated with the bidirectional switches in the conventional 9-switch matrix converter topology, and reduction in the conduction losses. The new matrix converter topology is capable of establishing the dual condition of unity displacement power factor on the utility-side and field vector control on the motor load-side. However, because of the special structure of the transformation matrix and the presence of DC components in the side-2 voltages, the branch currents on side-1 and the AC voltages on side-2 contain some unwanted components resulting in additional losses and waveform distortions. This paper addresses the above problem and proposes a novel technique for the elimination of the unwanted components. Experimental results are used to verify the correctness of the theoretical expectations

Basic objective of synthesis of cam displacement functions is minimizing the acceleration and jerk of the cam-follower especially in high-speed drives. Here classical splines of 6-, 7- and 8-orders and B-splines of 6- and 8-orders are taken for designing cam displacement functions. Multiple control points are introduced. Acceleration and jerk are minimized by manipulating the control point parameters. A searching procedure is adopted, based on GA and fuzzy membership function. It establishes that introduction of control points largely minimizes acceleration and jerk.

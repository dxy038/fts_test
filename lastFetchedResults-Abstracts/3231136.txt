In order to achieve up to 1 Gbit/s peak data rate in the future IMT-Advanced mobile systems, carrier aggregation (CA) technique is introduced by the 3GPP to support higher data rate transmissions over wide frequency bandwidths (up to 100 MHz) in the LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) standards. This technical envisagement puts forward the new challenge in resource allocation. In this paper, we investigates the component carrier (CC) allocation in LTE-A system. We first separate the resource allocation into CC-, resource block (RB)- and power-allocation. Then, an optimization problem that maximizes system sum capacity with proportional fairness(PF) guarantee is formulated. To simplify the optimization problem, we present an approximate RB allocation approach and two alternative objective functions. A greedy algorithm for CC allocation (GACCA) with low computational complexity is presented to solve the simplified optimization problem. To further improve the quality of solution, we introduce cross entropy method into GACCA. Numerical simulations verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

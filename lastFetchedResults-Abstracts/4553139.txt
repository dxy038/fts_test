We present a multi-objective optimization approach for indoor wireless network planning subject to constraints for exposure minimization, coverage maximization and power consumption minimization. We consider heterogeneous networks consisting of WiFi Access Points (APs) and Long Term Evolution (LTE) femtocells. We propose a design framework based on Multi-objective Biogeography-based Optimization (MOBBO). The results of the proposed method indicate the advantages and applicability of the multi-objective approach.

This paper presents system analysis, modeling and simulation of an electric vehicle (EV) with three different control strategies: field oriented control (FOC), direct torque control (DTC), and DTC using space vector modulation (DTC- SVM). The objective is to assess the control strategy impact on the EV efficiency taking into account the vehicle dynamics. Indeed, among EV motor electric propulsion features, the energy efficiency is a basic characteristic that is influenced by vehicle dynamics and system architecture. Simulation tests have been carried out on a 37-kW EV that consists in an induction motor with a three-level IGBT inverter. Preliminary results seem to indicate that the DTC-SVM scheme is the best candidate.

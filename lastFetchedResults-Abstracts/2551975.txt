Background and Objective: Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most prevalent brain neurodegenerative diseases, in which neurons are destroyed, especially in related areas of cognitive activities. It is the leading cause of senile dementia, characterized by neuronal degeneration cognitive deteriorations, especially in the elderly. In the past, many drug therapies have been introduced for Alzheimer’s disease, however, there has not been much success. Therefore, in this research the effect of extract of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) on consolidation phase of memory in streptozotocin rat model of Alzheimer's disease was studied. 

Materials and Methods: In this study, 30 male Wistar rats were divided into five groups. One group had not any injections (intact group), control groups (dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)) or DMSO+aCSF, one group received dimethylsulfoxide-streptozotocin (at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg), another group received intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ) and intraperitoneal cinnamon extract. For induction of Alzheimer’s disease, STZ was injected intracereboventricularly and after that, rats received intraperitoneal cinnamon extract (125 mg/kg, i.p.) for 4 days. To assess learning and memory in rats, the passive avoidance learning test was performed.

Results: Intracereboventricular STZ severely impaired learning and memory in rats and extract significantly prevented this impairment (P < 0.001). 

Conclusion: The overall results showed that Cinnamomum zeylanicum extract may treat cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease.

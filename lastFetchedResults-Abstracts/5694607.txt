The main objective of this pilot study is to improve our understanding of the potential of RFID in the context of warehousing activities in one specific supply chain in the retail industry. Empirical data was gathered from four tightly inter-related firms from three layers of the supply chain. Results indicate that RFID appears to be a disruptive technology as it supports a new business model, entails major redesign of existing processes and fosters a higher level of electronic integration between supply chain members.

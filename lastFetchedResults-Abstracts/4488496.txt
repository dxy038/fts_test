This work concerns the development of a multi-camera tracking system and is linked with the context of human activity monitoring. Our strategy of sensor combination integrates contextual information for representing the suitability of each camera for the task. The suitability of a sensor combines two main points. Firstly it is based on the notion of spatial "isolation" with respect to other object and secondly on the notion of "visibility" with respect to the sensor. A centralized filter combines the result of the local tracking estimations (sensor level) and then performs the track management. The main objective of the proposed architecture is to deal with the problem of visual occlusion.

Introduction: Leisure-time (LTPA), occupational, transportation, and household physical activity were evaluated among participants in the Inter-Tribal Heart Project (ITHP).
Methods: Age-stratified random samples of persons aged ≥25 years were drawn from three communities of Chippewa and Menominee Indians in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Participants (843 women and 501 men) completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess age-adjusted associations between no reported LTPA and potential correlates.
Results: During leisure time, 12% of women and 17% of men were active 7–12 months in the past year; 33% of women and 21% of men reported no LTPA. During a typical workday for employed persons, approximately 90% of both genders walked ≥20 minutes, for carrying/lifting moderate to heavy objects the median value for men was 1 hour and women 0 hours. The median value of weekly household activity for men was 3 hours compared to 10 hours for women. Little transportation activity was reported by either gender. Age, household income, smoking, and poor/fair self-perceived health were associated with leisure-time inactivity in women (p< 0.05). Age, poor/fair self-perceived health, and smoking were associated with leisure-time inactivity in men (p< 0.05). Walking was the most prevalent activity in the population.
Conclusions: Prevalence of leisure-time inactivity is higher than the national health objective of 15%, however, ITHP participants obtain a substantial amount of occupational and household activity that may lower risks of chronic diseases. Health promotion efforts to increase LTPA may lead not only to reduced chronic disease risk, but to additional benefits of enjoyment and improved psychological well-being.

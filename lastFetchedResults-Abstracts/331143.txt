Objective
The purpose of this study was to characterize the etching behavior of titanium in concentrated sulfuric acid and discuss its application on surface modification of titanium for biological use.
Methods

Commercially pure titanium (cpTi) plate was etched in 48% H2SO4 at RT −90 °C for 0.25–8 h. The weight loss was derived from the weight differences before and after etching. The surfaces after etching were characterized by surface roughness, X-ray diffractometry, and scannning electron spectroscopy. The apparent activation energy of the dissolution of cpTi into acid was derived from an Arrhenius plot of the rate of weight loss versus the acid temperature.
Results

The surface roughness of cpTi increased with the acid temperature and etching time. The surface roughness was strongly related to the weight loss. The weight loss increased drastically with the acid temperature after an initial period, which shortened with increasing acid temperature. The apparent activation energy for the dissolution of cpTi in H2SO4 was derived as 67.8 kJ/mol.
Significance

This study indicates that etching with concentrated sulfuric acid is an effective way to modify the surface of titanium for biological applications.

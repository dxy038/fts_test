Understanding and Knowing security environment and its analysis are complicated and ambiguous areas in the realm of security studies.
Therefore, its theoretical foundations enjoy poor research sources. The role of understanding security environment poses the effective element in formulating security strategies of any country. Based on this necessity, the researcher tries to introduce a model for objective understanding in other words, engineering the security environment by using Sniktix Technique (one of the techniques for creating idea) and also tries to explain the effective central and main elements on environment and he does his best to develop the theoretical literature of this field as much as he can by using deductive - analogy approach and ideation.
And for answering the main question of research, id est, what are the elements of understanding and analysing security environment? It introduces strategies such as engineering of security environment, the role of dominated discourse and central factor and... for understanding and analysing this area.

ABSTRACT: Seaweeds contain high levels of minerals, vitamins, essential amino acids, indigestible carbohydrates, and dietary fiber. The objective of this study was to compare Spirulina seaweed yellow alkaline noodles made with different levels of green seaweed to make Yellow alkaline noodle products of high nutritional quality with rich fiber content. Green seaweed powder (Spirulina) was incorporated in different proportions (0, 5, 10, 15%) in noodles. Proximate compositions (protein, fiber, ash, fat, moisture), pH, color, textural intensities, cooking properties (Cooking yield, Cooking loss), and sensory qualities of noodles were evaluated. The results of noodle formula development showed that as the amount of Spirulina seaweed powder increased, the stickiness of the noodles decreased and the appearance became darker. The crude fiber contents of Spirulina seaweed yellow alkaline noodles increased by the addition of Spirulina seaweed powder. Thus, edible seaweeds such as Spirulina might be used as a food supplement to improve the nutritional recommended daily intake.

Objective
m of the present study was to evaluate and compare the expression of CD105 (endoglin) in solid multicystic ameloblastoma (SMA) and unicystic ameloblastoma (UA).
als and methods
enesis was assessed in 20 SMA, 15 UA and 10 normal oral mucosa samples by measuring the mean vascular density (MVD), total vascular area (TVA) and mean vascular area (MVA). The immunohistochemistry was carried out by using monoclonal mouse anti-human antibody against CD105.
s
uskal–Wallis test showed significant difference in mean MVD, TVA, and MVA between SMA, UA, and control group (p &lt; 0.001). Using the Mann–Whitney test, the mean MVD, TVA and MVA, was statistically significant between SMA and control group (p &lt; 0.001) as well as between UA and control group (p &lt; 0.001). No significant difference of mean MVD, TVA, and MVA, was observed between SMA and UA (p &gt; 0.05).
sion
udy results show no significant difference in MVD, TVA and MVA between SMA and UA. This may reflect the fact that though clinical behaviour, histopathological presentation and prognosis of SMA and UA differ, the process of angiogenesis is not different. This suggests that the angiogenesis has an important role in tumour progression and invasiveness of ameloblastoma. Measurement and assessment of tumour angiogenesis may prove very valuable in predicting response to antiangiogenic therapeutic strategies and also provide objective assessment of post therapeutic response particularly in recurrent cases of SMA and UA.

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) have successfully been applied to solve constrained problems in network design. Network systems are being designed with fiber optic, as the usersÂ´ requirements are growing all the time. Selecting a suitable depiction of candidate solutions to the problem at hand is the crucial issue for applying GAs. Well defined network topologies, such as Single Ring, Double Ring and Grid, have been intensively scrutinized. As the number of nodes increases, optimization of the network for a given topology can be challenging for any human or specialized algorithm. For EAs/GAs where the objective is optimization of some characteristics even thought that there is no guaranty that the best optimized solution, better solutions after many runs can be found. These solutions are getting near the optimal one at each time until reaching some satisfaction.

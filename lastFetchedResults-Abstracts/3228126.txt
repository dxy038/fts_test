This paper presents a robust multiuser detection technique for direct sequence-code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems over Nakgami-m fading channels in the presence of impulsive noise. Robust M-decorrelating detector to demodulate non-coherent DPSK signals is implemented by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The PSO algorithm is used to obtain optimum M-estimates by minimizing an objective function, which is a sum of less rapidly increasing function of residuals. Simulation results are provided to show the evolutionary behavior and efficacy of the modified-Hampel based M-estimator in comparison with linear decorrelating detector, the Huber and the Hampel estimator based detectors.

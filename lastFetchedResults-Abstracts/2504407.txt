Background: Reviewing the literature, reveals that pentoxifylline (PTX) plus tocopherol (vitamin E) are used mainly to promote sperm quality. However trials focusing on the effects of these drugs in female partner are limited. Combination of pentoxifylline and vitamin E appeared to improve the pregnancy rate in patients with a thin endometrium by increasing the endometrial thickness and improving ovarian function.
Objective: To determine whether combined PTX and tocopherol treatment can improve clinical pregnancy rate.
Materials and Methods: One hundred twelve infertile women undergoing standardized controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for ICSI- ZIFT entered this randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized to equal groups of combined PTX and tocopherol therapy or none (not receiving PTX and tocopherol). These drugs were administered to the intervention group for two cycles before starting ICSI-ZIFT cycle. Main outcome measure was clinical pregnancy rate. SPSS.11 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago IL.) was used for data collection and analysis.
Results: The clinical pregnancy was higher in the intervention (combined PTX and tocopherol) group in comparison to the other group (57.14% vs 39.29%, p=0.01). However, there was no difference in the mean endometrial thickness, number of retrieved oocytes, the number of metaphase II oocytes and grade of them in both groups.
Conclusion: This study showed that PTX plus tocopherol could improve the ZIFT outcome in infertile couples. Local effects and anti oxidative characteristics of these drugs may be the cause of better results.

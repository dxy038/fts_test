OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether cervical cerclage reduces the maternal and neonatal morbidity in women with placenta previa.
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-nine pregnant women with an initial diagnosis of placenta previa at 24 to 30 weeks’ gestation were randomly assigned to cervical cerclage (n = 19) or conservative management (n = 20). Subjects were followed up until delivery. Primary outcome measure was gestational age at delivery. Secondary outcome measures were prolongation of pregnancy, number of patients bleeding after being randomly assigned, units of blood transfused, birth weight, hospital stay and costs, and admission to neonatal intensive care unit. Statistical significance was calculated by the Student t test, Fisher’s exact probability test, and the χ2 with Yates’ correction factor.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups studied.
CONCLUSION: Cervical cerclage does not appear to be an adequate alternative for the management of placenta previa. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:122-5.)

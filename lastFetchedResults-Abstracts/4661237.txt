Porous silicon nanostructures (PSiNs) has attracted attention as a promising material for optoelectronics applications. For this experiment, we present measurements of photoluminescence and electroluminescence of PSiNs. The study of the electrical properties of this material due to its potential as a novel porous silicon based devices. Objective of this experiment is to determine the electroluminescence of PSiNs. PSiNs samples were prepared by photo-electrochemical anodization using p-type silicon substrate. For the formation of PSiNs, a fixed current density (J=20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>), was applied for the variety of etching time (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 minutes). The light emission can be observed at visible range. Effective EL spectrum will be observed with its maximum intensity at ~655 nm (sample of 30 minutes), which is similar to its PL spectrum at ~675 nm. PSiNs is very promising material for light-emitting diode (LED) application. Porous silicon nanostructures light-emitting diode (PSiNs-LED) will be future flat screen display devices and one of the high potential demands of devices.

In this paper, the optimal power flow analysis is carried out using bacterial foraging algorithm for multi-objective function by considering security constrained and non-smooth cost function. The available capacities of transmission lines are considered for wheeling transactions in the restructured electrical network and the transmission lines are checked for congestion. If there is any congestion then power producers is rescheduled by proposed approach. The proposed method is used to alleviate the congestion, improves the loadability and voltage stability, and reduces the line losses and cost of production by controlling the power flow in the network. And also congestion cost is calculated from the adjustments bids. The proposed method is demonstrated on IEEE 30 bus system and the results are to be compared with other optimization methods.

The main problems occurring during solving the tasks of multiple-criterion optimization of ICs are analyzed in this paper. It is explained that only effective approximating models provide acceptable time of finding optimal solutions of such tasks. We propose the approach for practical solution of multi-objective IC optimization task. Simplified models of ICs are developed in this approach. Practical aspects of the use of simplified models for solving the task of multiple-criterion optimization of ICs with complex analogue function are considered.

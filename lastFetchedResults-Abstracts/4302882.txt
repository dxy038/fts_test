Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is a new network technology where the cars are used as mobile nodes to form a communication network. In VANET, routing protocols have a significant role in terms of the performance because they determine the way of sending and receiving packets between mobile nodes. In this paper, we examine and analyze the performance of Ad-hoc On-Demand (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocols over Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic data type using different speeds and number of nodes. The performance measurements; Packet Delivery Ratio, Average End to End Delay and Average Throughput are examined with respect to speed and number of nodes. The objective of this study is to find the best routing protocol which can be further used for enhancing security. Based on our validated results, AODV performs the best among all three evaluated protocols.

Conventional phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement methods normally use the number of PMU installations as the objective function which is to be minimized. However, the cost of one installation of PMU is not always the same in different locations. It depends on a number of factors. One of these factors is taken into account in the proposed PMU placement method in this paper, which is the number of adjacent branches to the PMU located buses. The concept of full topological observability is adopted and a version of binary particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized. Results from the test on a 17-bus system are demonstrated.

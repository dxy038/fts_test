Background: Selecting the best embryo for transfer, with the highest chance of achieving
a vital pregnancy, is a major goal in current in vitro fertilization (IVF) technology.
The high rate of embryonic developmental arrest during IVF treatment is one of the
limitations in achieving this goal. Chromosomal abnormalities are possibly linked with
chromosomal arrest and selection against abnormal fertilization products. The objective
of this study was to evaluate the frequency and type of chromosomal abnormalities in
preimplantation embryos with developmental arrest.
Materials and Methods: This cohort study included blastomeres of embryos with early
developmental arrest that were biopsied and analyzed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization
(FISH) with probes for chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21 and 22. Forty-five couples
undergoing IVF treatment were included, and 119 arrested embryos were biopsied. All
probes were obtained from the Kinderwunsch Zentrum, Linz, Austria, between August
2009 and August 2011.
Results: Of these embryos, 31.6% were normal for all chromosomes tested, and 68.4%
were abnormal. Eleven embryos were uniformly aneuploid, 20 were polyploid, 3 were
haploid, 11 displayed mosaicism and 22 embryos exhibited chaotic chromosomal complement.
Conclusion: Nearly 70% of arrested embryos exhibit chromosomal errors, making chromosomal
abnormalities a major cause of embryonic arrest and may be a further explanation
for the high developmental failure rates during culture of the embryos in the IVF
setting.

In this article, we present some development results of a system that performs mosaicing (or mosaicking) of panoramic faces. Our objective is to study the feasibility of panoramic face construction in real-time. To do so, we built a simple acquisition system composed of 5 standard cameras which, together, can take simultaneously 5 views of a face at different angles. Then, we chose an easily hardware-achievable algorithm, consisting of successive linear transformations, in order to compose a panoramic face from these 5 views. The method has been tested on a relatively large number of faces. In order to validate our system of panoramic face mosaicing, we also conducted a preliminary study on panoramic faces recognition, based on the principal component method. Experimental results show the feasibility and viability of our system.

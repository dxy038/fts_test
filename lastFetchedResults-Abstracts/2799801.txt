Software Testing is the critical task for any software which helps in building trust and confidence in the product. Usually, the emphasis is on Manual Testing but to reduce cost there is a need of automation in software testing process. This paper proposes a method to generate automated uniformly distributed test cases based on the platform of multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The proposed method is analyzed on the domain of Pareto-Optimality, Dominance and Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm.

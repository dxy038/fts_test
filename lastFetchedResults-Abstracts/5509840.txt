A single-phase bidirectional AC-DC boost rectifier is proposed for a 380V DC power distribution system to control bidirectional power flows and to improve its power conversion efficiency. To reduce the switches´ losses of the proposed full-bridge AC-DC rectifier using an unipolar switching method, switching devices employ IGBTs, MOSFETs, and SiC diodes. Using the analysis of the rectifier´s operating modes, each switching device can be selected by considering switch stresses. In addition, a simple and intuitive frequency detection method for a single-phase SRF-PLL is proposed using fast period detector and FIR filter to improve the tracking dynamics of PLL under fundamental frequency variations. Experimental results will verify the performance of the proposed methods using a 5 kW prototype rectifier.

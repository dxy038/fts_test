Advanced metering system is used to measure, collect, store, analyze and use power consumption information. At present, there is no official version standard released at home and abroad. The rapid development of smart grid puts forward higher requirements to its standardization. Series standards of advanced metering system need to be established. It analyzed the research status of the domestic and international advanced metering standard infrastructure. According to the construction progress and development trends of smart grid, it proposed specific requirements to its standardization. It launched the research of standard for smart metering equipment and power consumption information collection device. It proposed the standardization construction scheme of network communication technology and business data management and application system. At last, it put forward proposals for the standardization of smart bidirectional interaction, smart energy consumption service and information security protection system to regulate and guide the construction and application of advanced metering infrastructure. It provides technical support for perception of smart grid, intelligent control, flexible and interactive, friendly and open, economic and efficient application of advanced metering infrastructure.

The scope for diffusion of very low-enthalpy geothermal plants in the Piemonte region of Italy, using groundwater heat pumps (GWHP), was analyzed to check environmental sustainability and the benefits in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. GWHP implementation seemed particularly suitable to the specific characteristics of the Piemonte plain. An important thick and productive shallow aquifer is present across the entire plain beneath the major energy users and is therefore appropriate for geothermal energy development purposes. The building stock could be adapted to heat pumps in different ways, but objective-oriented policies will be required to reach the best results in terms of environmental benefits.

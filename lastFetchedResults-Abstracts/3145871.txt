According to current commercial bank management requirements of credit risk, this paper studies the optimization allocation model of incremental economic capital of credit businesses in commercial bank. It has the objective function of Economic Value Added (EVA) and the restrictive conditions of hurdle rate, risk adjusted return on capital (RAROC), available economic capital gross, degree of concentration and speeding-up limitation of risk exposure in credit businesses portfolio and so on. To solve shareholderÂ´s value creation of the economic capital optimization problem, then incremental economic capital allocation model of credit operations is built up. Empirical studies have shown that the method of genetic algorithm optimization tool to solve the allocation model is scientific and feasible.

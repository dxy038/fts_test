(Objective) Discovering this" How" is possible through thematic interpretation of politics in the Quran and its authorization along with islamization of political knowledge (Hypothesis). Investigating this hypothesis depends on the identification and explanation of approaches of political studies in the Holy Quran (Method) with the intention of showing the scientific authority of the Quran (Objective). Accordingly, it should be mentioned that second rate studies (the influence of the Quran on political studies) are preferable to first rate studies (investigating the political viewpoints of the Quran) (Findings).

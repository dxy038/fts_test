This paper reports progress within the AUSNET (autonomous undersea systems network) program. AUSNET addresses the need for ad-hoc self-forming networks that can operate in the low-bandwidth undersea environment. The AUSNET program has focused on creation of a network capability based on dynamic source routing (DSR), including the application programmerÂ´s interface (API) between the network drivers and the autonomous undersea applications using these drivers. The capability has been tested within the cooperative AUV development concept (CADCON) simulation environment, and. self-forming and adaptive network capabilities have been demonstrated. Additionally, the incorporation of dead reckoning algorithms into the AUSNET protocol has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number network routing packets required to support the self-forming network, thus enabling improved performance and releasing bandwidth for content (as opposed to network support) data transmissions. Current efforts are focused on transition into an operational environment. The final objective of the AUSNET program is to provide a network capability that would enable the AUV community to achieve interoperability both rapidly and cost effectively.

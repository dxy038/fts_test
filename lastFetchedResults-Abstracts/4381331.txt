This special issue focuses on elucidating computational neuroscience: an interdisciplinary field of scientific research in which one of the primary goals is to understand how electronic activity in brain cells and networks enables biological intelligence. The objective is to provide a selection of papers that expose and review research efforts in aspects of computational neuroscience that demonstrate its rapidly growing intersection with electrical, electronic and computer engineering, and the prospects for interaction in the near and long-term future.

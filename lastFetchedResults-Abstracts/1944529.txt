The main objective of this work was to study the effects of nanoclay (NC), microcrystallinecellulose (MCC), and coupling agent (MAPP) on the mechanical and thermal properties. Theresults showed that mechanical properties of the composites made with MCC were significantlysuperior to those of unfilled. Addition of MAPP could enhance the mechanical and thermalproperties of the blends, due to the improvement of interface bond between the filler andmatrix. The significant improvements in tensile properties of the blends composites made withMAPP and NC were further supported by SEM micrographs. The thermo gravimetric analysisindicated that the addition of 5 wt.% MAPP and 3 wt.% NC remarkably increased the thermalstability of the blends compared to the pure PP. It is to be noted that MCC could not improvethe thermal stability.

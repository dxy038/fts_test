In this study, the authors consider a transmitter location finding problem in a wireless network equipped with RAKE receivers. In these types of receivers, fading is mitigated in the wireless communication channel. This fading is due to multiple versions of the transmitted signal at a spread of arrival times. In the RAKE receiver, a certain number of them are needed - called strongest - to have received signal strength above a threshold. In the optimum location finding problem, the number of bad receiving points determined based on a proposed error function is minimised. Two different criteria, which are defined through the RAKE receiver architecture, form this error function. Thus, a multi-objective optimisation problem is herein solved in order to solve transmitter location finding problem. The proposed optimisation method contains a jointly designed ray tracing engine (RTE) and genetic algorithm (GA). The algorithm is applied on a sample environment, which is fully simulated with RTE. The GA, which is integrated to RTE, determines optimum location(s) of transmitters. The results show that the proposed method perfectly finds the best locations of the minimum number of transmitters.

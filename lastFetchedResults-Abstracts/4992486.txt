The research presented in this paper develops a framework to enhance vehicle fuel consumption efficiency while approaching a signalized intersection through the provision of signal phase and timing information that may be available through vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. While past research uses simplified objective functions to optimize fuel consumption and/or emissions caused by signalized intersections, this research highlights the importance of retaining microscopic fuel consumption models in the optimization function. It presents an example which shows that simplified objective functions may result in erroneous conclusions.

<strong>Objective:</strong> The main purpose of this study was to validate the short-form of the Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire (ESCQ) Scale among Iranian undergraduate students.  <strong><br />Method:</strong> A total of 250 nurse undergraduate students participated in this study. Participants completed the ESCQ in addition to measures of Sheering Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire and Student's Demographic Questionnaire.  <strong><br />Results:</strong> Exploratory factor analysis resulted in three factors that were largely consistent with the a priori scale structure. These factors included such dimensions as appraisal of others' emotions, managing and regulating emotion and specifying and understanding the individuals' own emotions.<br /> <strong>Conclusions :</strong> The results provide initial support for the construct validity of the self- report version of the ESCQ in nurse students.

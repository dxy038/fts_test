In automated electroplating facilities, computer-controlled hoist is used to ensure the transport of jobs between tanks. Each job is mounted on a carrier and each carrier is immersed successively in several chemical baths, following a given processing sequence. The aim of this paper is to present an evolutionary approach to solve a multi-objective Cyclic Hoist Scheduling Problem (CHSP). The criteria which are considered here are to maximize the line production, by minimizing the cycle time; and to minimize the environmental waste in addition to energy consumption. Some experiments are carried out to show the reliability of this multi-objective approach.

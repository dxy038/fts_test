Aimed at the inverse kinematics problem of robot manipulators, this paper proposed a subsection algorithm based on the simplex method. Firstly, the simplex method is explained detailedly, in this paper, and then, aimed at a manipulator with 6 degree-of freedom, a subsection algorithm based on the simplex method is proposed. The proposed algorithm doesnÂ´t need to calculate the first derivative of the objective function when calculating the searching direction and step length. After limit iterations, the angle vector can converge to the solution of problem in large range. Finally, aimed at an inverse kinematics problem of a manipulator with 6 degree-of-freedom, some simulation is given under the proposed algorithm, and the effectiveness, high precision and the speediness of this algorithm are shown through comparing to the classical simplex method and the conjugate gradient method

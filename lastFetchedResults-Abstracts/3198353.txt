Matrix converters are direct converters capable of converting an alternative input power to an alternative output power at different voltage and frequency without using intermediate storage devices. This paper presents an analytical study of an SPSP matrix converter topology with four bidirectional switches. This topology with the necessary switching strategy was then modeled and simulated and the results and conclusions gained are presented. The paper proved the ability of achieving direct ac&#8594;ac conversion depending to a large extendon the software that governs the operation of the matrix converter. The paper also treated to the design of a certain additional circuits required for matrix convertor operation improvements. Such as an input filter and a clamp circuit required to protect the bidirectional switches of the convertor. These circuits help reducing the spikes in voltage across these switches and improving other factors. The method used to commutate the currents in the converter switches is a four-step method, which contributes to reduce stresses experienced by the switches. Using the adopted circuits and methods suitable for the operation of the matrix convertor, a power factor very near to unity (0.997) leading at the input using an inductive load of (0.1) power factor at the required output frequency and a total harmonic distortion of (1.2%) of the load current have been obtained.

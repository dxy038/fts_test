Vehicle Routing Problems have been extensively analyzed to reduce transportation costs. More particularly, the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (DVRPTW) imposes the period of time of customer availability and the request time of customer as two constraints, which precisely reflects the real world situations. Using minimization of the total distance as the main objective to be fulfilled, this paper proposes a general framework to deal with DVRPTW. Based on this framework, different local search heuristics are also designed to wisely adjust the convergence speed. Extensive experiments are conducted. And the results prove the effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach.

In this paper, the process of evacuation in teaching building is considered. The concept of steady degree based on cellular automata and potential field is introduced and it can describe the behavior tendency of evacuees during the evacuation process. With the help of steady degree, the model simulates the indoor evacuation behavior. To reduce the congestion and evacuation time, a multi-objective optimization model considering steady degree and evacuation clearance time is proposed. Finally, an experiment in the Teaching Building No.1 of Wuhan University of Technology is carried out. The results show that this model can reduce the clearance time of emergency evacuation in teaching building compared to other models.

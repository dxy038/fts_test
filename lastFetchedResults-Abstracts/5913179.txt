This paper presents a modified harmony search (MHS) algorithm for solving 0-1 knapsack problems. MHS employs position update strategy for generating new solution vectors that enhances accuracy and convergence rate of harmony search (HS) algorithm. Besides, the harmony memory consideration rate (HMCR) is dynamically adapted to the changing of objective function value in the current harmony memory. Based on the experiment of solving ten classic 0-1 knapsack problems, the MHS has demonstrated stronger convergence and stability than original harmony search (HS) algorithm and its two improved algorithms (IHS and NGHS).

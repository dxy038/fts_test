A multiple objective model for manpower planning in a company sized, 100 person, military reserve unit was developed and tested. The model involves five objectives and consists of over 1150 decision variables and 650 constraints over a 12 month planning horizon. US Army Reserve officers were used as subjects in an experiment in which model solutions were generated interactively using two different solution procedures. One procedure asked subjects to identify their most preferred solution from a set of candidate solutions at each stage of the interactive process, while the other procedure asked subjects to identify their least preferred solution.

This paper describes the development of a flatness measurement system, integrated in the control process of a hot strip mill in the steel industry. The objective of the system is to calculate flatness indexes for every rolled strip, comparing the length of its lateral profiles with the central length. The reconstruction of the profiles is based on a non-linear triangulation technique. Images of the steel strip, at high temperature and high speed, are sampled every two milliseconds at five different points and are processed on-line in order to calculate height displacement values of the strip, which allows the calculation of final flatness indexes for the steel strip. The measurement method developed,introduces an innovative geometry in the disposition of the optic elements which increases the measurement range of the system without reducing its precision. It also includes a tracking system to compensate for the effects of lateral displacements of the strip. The flatness measurement system has been implemented using a heterogeneous distributed computer system

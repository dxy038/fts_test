Objective
Since maxillary sinus is composed of bone structure, the main symptoms of maxillary sinus carcinoma are related to the anatomical feature and the destructive lesion of the bony wall, such as cheek pain and nasal obstruction.
Methods
We report a female case with undifferentiated carcinoma in the right maxillary sinus, only appearing cervical swelling which was revealed as lymph node metastasis.
Results
CT and MRI findings showed just maxillary sinusitis with minor bone destruction. However, fluorine 18-labelled deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was useful for the detection of the primary site. The patient received concomitant chemoradiotherapy, and showed a complete response both in the primary site and neck lymph nodes. She has no recurrence for 18 months after the primary therapy.
Conclusion
The main symptoms of maxillary sinus carcinoma are related to the local progression, and known to have less cervical lymph node metastasis. However, like the present case, there is a rare case that has no symptom and organic features associated with the local mass. With the best use of advanced diagnostic technique, e.g., FDG-PET, we could diagnose and treat atypical maxillary sinus carcinoma patients.

In mobility-aware of Internet of Things (IOT), according to the problem of data-aware and data-transmit which casued by nodes mobility and random. We propose the nodes social relations cognition algorithm which based on social network. Firstly, we would quantize the social relation of all nodes by introducing interconnection factor and distance factor. Then, build cohesive subgroups and node-mobile probability tree to predict the trace of mobile nodes. Finally, we determine awareness service nodes in the objective regions, through trust-transference and probability calculation. Simulation experiment demonstrate that this method helps to resolve the problem of awareness hole in sparse networks, improving the way of date acquistion and increasing the quality of awareness service in IOT.

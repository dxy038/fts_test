In order to obtain high sunlight transmittance for silicon thin film solar cells, the textured surface such as pyramid shapes is commonly
considered along the boundary between the silicon layer and the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer. Layered structure
design having the improved transmittance into the light absorbing layer for specific frequencies is derived using the so called topology
optimization design method combined with the time dependent finite element analysis. A triangle patterned textured surface is considered
as the initial shape for two-dimensional wave analysis and the periodic boundary condition is applied to both sides of the unit-structure
model. The design objective is set to maximize the energy flux at the specified wave absorbing area during some time period so that the
objective function is evaluated as the time integration of a Poynting vector formulation. A multiple layered pattern representing a silicon
layer and a TCO layer in turn is obtained for the optimal shape of the light absorbing boundary. As thicknesses of each layer are associated
with the incident beam wavelength, various wavelengths of incident light condition are considered and each of the optimal design
cases according to the wavelength are compared.

The process control of in-situ bioremediation system is complex and involves multiple objectives. An interactive multi-objective decision-making tool has been developed for process control of the in-situ bioremediation system. The controller consists of three steps. First, the evolutionary multi-objective optimization method is used to identify a set of optimal control strategies and costs corresponding to different efficiency requirements. Secondly, the costs and efficiencies are normalized based on results from a questionnaire that has been developed for acquiring information about the normalization functions. In the third step, the interactive system acquires the userÂ´s preferences on tradeoffs of the two objectives of cost and efficiencies. Then the system generates the optimal control strategy using genetic algorithm. The interactive system has been applied to a case study. The results show that the control system can taken into consideration relative importance of each objective and generate a set of optimal strategies based on the particular requirements of the decision maker

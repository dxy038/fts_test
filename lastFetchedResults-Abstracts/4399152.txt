The problem of multi-objective feedback controller design of nonlinear systems is solved in this paper. The T-S fuzzy model is adopted to describe the nonlinear systems and genetic algorithm is used to identify the T-S fuzzy model. The identified T-S fuzzy model is reduced by applying Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) method. Based on the reduced T-S fuzzy model, an optimal state feedback controller is designed by achieving the trade-off among three conflicting object functions using the optimal Pareto frontier. The simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Cube connected cycles (CCC), a popular and layout-efficient alternative to the hypercube, uses duplex dimensional links. The paper proposes a variant of the CCC interconnection using simplex dimensional links. Usage of simplex links (instead of duplex) is shown to have design advantages. Cost-performance comparison of the proposed ´directed cube connected cycles´ (DCCC) structure with bidirectional CCC is shown. DCCC layout is compared with CCC layout and a routing algorithm for DCCC is proposed. A method for porting CCC algorithms to DCCC is provided, and the extent of slowdown is evaluated. DCCC can embed a loop with unit dilation and unit expansion.

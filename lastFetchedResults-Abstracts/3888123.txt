The authors study the autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) filter for lidar signal processing. After a short presentation of the atmospheric laser Doppler instrument project (ALADIN), they introduce the objective of this paper, which is to extract the Doppler frequency and to retrieve the spectral width of a noised lidar signal. A general presentation of ARMA filters and parametric adaptive algorithms (PAAs) is provided. Then they present results about the choice of the model, the Doppler frequency estimate, and the spectral width estimate. Finally, they study the possible estimate of SNR, which is biased by the first estimates (Doppler frequency and spectral width)

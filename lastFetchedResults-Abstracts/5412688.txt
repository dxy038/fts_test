This study purposes to propose a method of measuring quality of context information in ubiquitous environments. Because Context information is important in ubiquitous environments, quality dimensions and measurement methods should be considered according to characteristics of context information. To measure quality, first, we comprehend the nature of context information in ubiquitous environments, then extracted user??s concern about quality from the nature. Second, on the user??s concern, we proposed quality dimensions as: accuracy, completeness, representation consistency, access security and up-to-dateness. Third, we addressed a method of quality measurement, to illustrate this approach, we presented a first measure using accuracy and completeness as quality dimensions. We enabled objective evaluation of quality level through proposal of a method suitable to quality measurement of context information.

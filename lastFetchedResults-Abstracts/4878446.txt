This work explores the implementation of Bluetooth technology in mobile robots. The mobile robot has the capability to move around autonomously using a complicated and powerful algorithm. The algorithms are stored in a PC that acts as a master cum server. All sensor readings from the mobile robot are transmitted to the master and processed. Then, a command or instruction for further action is transmitted from the server to the mobile robot in a bidirectional full duplex communication mode. Hence, the main "brain" is in the server instead of the mobile robot. This paper focuses on the interfacing between the Bluetooth transceiver and the Handy Board MC68HC11 micro-controller of the mobile robot. For a common case, a receiver and transmitter are needed for each device (robot and control unit), but with Bluetooth technology, only two Bluetooth transceivers are needed to achieve the full duplex connection.

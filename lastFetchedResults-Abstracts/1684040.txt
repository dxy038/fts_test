The objective of this note is to propose a dynamic output control scheme within the LMI framework for robust decentralized stabilization of systems composed of linear dynamic subsystems coupled by static nonlinear interconnections satisfying quadratic constraints. The procedure utilizes the general linear dynamic feedback structure, and consists of two steps, the first giving a block-diagonal Lyapunov matrix together with the robustness degree, and the second the controller parameters. A numerical example illustrates the applicability of the method.

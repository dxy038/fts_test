This paper studies a distributed fault-tolerant control (DFTC) problem for a multi-agent system modeling a large-scale power generator network. The objective is to enable all the agents to achieve the control goal of asymptotic stability without losing the system tracking performance while coordinately identifying the unknown input including nonlinear interconnections and coupling fault functions. A model-based distributed state estimator (DSE) is firstly designed to obtain the residual and a proportional-integral-like nonlinear distributed identifier (DI) is then developed to identify the unknown input. By exploiting the redundancies from the estimated information, a novel continuous DFTC scheme is designed to enable all the agents to achieve the control goal. A power system example and numerical simulation are provided to illustrate the effectiveness.

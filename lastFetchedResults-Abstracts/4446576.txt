The objective of this study was to determine the key factors within communication which facilitates the change process in a technical organization, thereby allowing the organization to reap the true benefits of the change. The results aim at improving the efficiency of roll-out by ensuring that the correct aspects of communication are adequately addressed during the change process. The research was conducted on a technical organisation, where the majority of the workforce comprised highly skilled and qualified individuals focusing on developing cutting edge technological innovations. Two rounds of Delphi questionnaires were used where the first-round questionnaire was analyzed to formulate the second-round questionnaire. The second-round questionnaire was used to determine the desirability, feasibility and importance of each of the factors under review. The study identified key change information to be communicated, the method of communication, and frequency of communication, preferred communicator and the necessity of the organization to understand the change information.

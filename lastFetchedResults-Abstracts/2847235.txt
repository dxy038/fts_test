This paper introduces a hybrid algorithm combining discrete harmony search (DHS) and iterated local search (ILS) for solving the multi-objective resource allocation problem (RAP). Two objectives are considered simultaneously, i.e. minimization of the overall cost and overall efficiency. The harmony search algorithm is used to conduct the global exploration task, while the iterated local search performs the exploitation work. In addition, an external Pareto archive set was introduced to memory the non-dominated solutions found so far. Experimental results on the well-known benchmarks verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the propose algorithm.

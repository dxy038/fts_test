ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress and its adverse effects in vitro or on the body can reduce the number of reproductive cells and embryo quality. Given the fact that vitamin C is a natural antioxidant with a protective role, in this study we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the level of vitamin C in follicular fluid (FF) and maturation of oocytes and embryo quality of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). 
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on the eggs and embryos of 50 patients admitted to IVF unit of Al Zahra Hospital, Rasht, Iran. Patients underwent the same mediations used to induce ovulation, and then they were injected 10000 units of human chorionic gonadotropin. Finally, they underwent 36 hours of follicle suction. Vitamin C level in FF was measured by biochemical methods. Maturation of oocytes and embryo quality were examined with inverted light microscope.
FINDINGS: After examining 583 eggs and 275 embryos the following results were obtained: the percentage of metaphase II oocytes in vitamin C level of less than one was 81.3% (412), but when compared to vitamin C level of one or more, it was 71.1% (54), which were significantly different (p=0.038). In the sub-classification, vitamin C level (0.5-1 mg/dl), MII oocyte frequency and the two pronuclei embryos were higher but the difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the quality of oocyte maturation and embryos in lower levels of vitamin C levels had improved, as compared to higher levels.

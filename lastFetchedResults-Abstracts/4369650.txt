A novel radio resource management approach composed of the space division multiple access (SDMA) strategy and the dynamic resource assignment for the stratospheric platform (SPF) communication system is proposed. Since the whole channel resource is shared with each beam of the digital beamforming (DBF) multibeam onboard antenna, it realizes our objective by making good use of the spectrum resource to meet the increasing demand of mobile communications and broadband fixed wireless access (FWA) services within the limited spectrum. Computer simulation result illustrate that the communication capacity of an SPF communication system increases significantly

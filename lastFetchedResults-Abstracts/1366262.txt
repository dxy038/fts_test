Background: Septins are an evolutionary conserved group of GTP-binding and filament-forming proteins that have diverse cellular roles. An increasing body of data implicates the septin family in the pathogenesis of diverse states including cancers, neurodegeneration, and male infertility. Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate the expression pattern of Septin14 in testis tissue of men with and without spermatogenic failure. Materials and Methods: The samples retrieved accessible random between infertile men who underwent diagnostic testicular biopsy in Royan institute. 10 infertile men with obstructive azoospermia and normal spermatogenesis and 20 infertile men with non-obstructive azoospermia were recruited for real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of the testicular tissue. Total RNA was extracted with trizol reagent. Results: Comparison of the mRNA level of septin14 revealed that in tissues with partial (n=10) or complete spermatogenesis (n=10), the expression of septin 14 was significantly higher than sertoli cell only tissues. Conclusion: The testicular tissues of men with hypospermatogenesis, maturation arrest and sertoli cell only had lower levels of septin 14 transcripts than normal men. These data indicates that Septin 14 expression level is critical for human spermatogenesis.

Excitatory amino acids, cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) have been studied in the etiology and pathogenesis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) of the newborn. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a known mediator of angiogenesis and has been shown to induce vascular proliferation and permeability via NO-mediated mechanism during hypoxia. The objective of this study was to investigate the cerebrospinal fluid and serum VEGF and NO levels in different stages of HIE and the correlation between the two mediators. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples of 19 newborns with HIE and 13 controls were obtained within the first 24 h of life and kept at −70 °C until the time of measurement. NO levels were determined by Sievers NOA by chemiluminescence method and VEGF levels were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay double sandwich method. The NO levels in CSF were higher than the control and mild HIE group in newborns with moderate to severe HIE, and VEGF levels in CSF were higher in the mild HIE group compared to controls but similar in the moderate to severe HIE group compared to mild HIE and control patients. There was no difference between groups with regard to serum NO or VEGF levels, and no correlation was observed between NO and VEGF levels both in CSF and serum samples. Depending on the severity of the hypoxic insult the stimulus for NO production by VEGF may have variable effects on endothelial cells which may give rise to the current results.

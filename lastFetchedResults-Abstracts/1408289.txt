The sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis is the vector of Leishmania infantum, the etiological agent of American visceral leishmaniasis. Despite its importance, until now the internal anatomy of the immature forms has never been described and little is known about their digestive processes. In nature, sand fly larvae feed on organic detritus in the soil, constantly ingesting large amounts of material. The objective of this study was to describe the anatomy of the gut and the pH of the gut lumen, as well as to investigate the proteases responsible for protein digestion. The larvae have a short gut with a prominent, well-developed midgut. Ingestion of food containing indicator dyes permitted the gut pH to be measured. A pH gradient was observed, varying from &gt;9 in the anterior midgut to 6.5–7.0, in the posterior midgut. The endoproteolytic enzymes are secreted in the anterior midgut and are able to digest azocasein over a large pH range, specially at pH 11. Studies with various inhibitors indicated that the digestive endoproteases are trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like enzymes. These results were confirmed by using the substrates BApNA and N-CBZ-l-PpNA, specific for trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. Aminopeptidases were also investigated with p-nitroaniline-derived substrates. These enzymes are located in the posterior midgut, bound to the membranes and functioning at an optimal pH of 6.5–8.0. The results presented here are consistent with the current proposal that proteins are digested to peptides in the anterior midgut inside the endoperitrophic space and subsequently undergo digestion in the ectoperitrophic space of the posterior midgut.

This paper is about the comparative analysis of the static converter and matrix converter, which are the major application in the electrical locomotives. The static converter is designed to convert the single phase input to a standard three phase supply by using the solid state switches which is more efficient and more reliable. In addition to this application of Static Converter in the locomotives, we improvised the design of this converter for operating at various frequencies, which finds various applications in industries as well as in the aerospace applications. The matrix converter is a special case of cyclo converter wherein the conversion is possible by using only 9 bidirectional switches instead of using 36 uni-directional switches used in cyclo converter. The matrix converter is a perfect replacement of the static converter, as the former has less conversion stages. In order to validate the implemented procedure the design was implemented in the simulink and the key results are compared with that of static converter.

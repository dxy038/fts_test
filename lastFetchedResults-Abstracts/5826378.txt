This paper discusses fuzzy-tuned PID controller design for anti-swing gantry crane control. The objective is employing simple structure of PID control by utilizing fuzzy system as gain tuners to improve its robustness to cope with parameters variations in the crane system. The proposed fuzzy-tuned PID system has simple structure. Instead of fixed PID gains, the gains are determined by means of a fuzzy inference system. Weighting factors are also added to fuzzy output. The simulation result shows that the proposed Fuzzy-tuned PID controllers has similar performance with PID controllers with advantage of robustness to parameters variations for anti-swing gantry crane control.

Distributed discrete event systems (Distributed DES) are increasing with the development of networks. A major problem of these systems is the evaluation of their performance at the design stage. We are particularly interested in assessing the impact of computer networking protocols on the control of manufacturing systems. In our design methodology, these systems are modeled using Petri nets. In this context, we propose an approach to modeling network protocols based on oriented object Petri nets. Our ultimate objective is to assess by means of simulations the performances of such a system when one distributes their control models on an operational architecture. In this study, we are implementing a component based approach designed to encourage reuse when modeling new network protocols. To illustrate our approach and its reuse capabilities, we will implement it to model the link layer protocols of the norms IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.3.

This paper introduces a novel speech enhancement system based on sub-band wiener filter with pitch synchronous analysis. The perceptual filter bank provides a good auditory representation, good perceptual quality of speech. Sub-band wiener filter based Pitch synchronous analysis reduces drawbacks of fixed window shift. To increase the inter frame similarities the shift of analysis window is based on pitch period. The pitch is extracted by using clipping level method. Further, to reduce noise each sub-band is wiener filtered using a priori SNR with adaptive parameter. Wavelets transform based wiener filter approach works well than DCT based approach. Objective (SNR, segSNR, LLR, LSD, IS,WSS) experiments prove that the new speech enhancement system is capable of significant noise reduction.

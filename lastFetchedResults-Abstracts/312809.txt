The purpose of this study was to establish and characterize the relationship between foot pressure analysis and radiographic measurements in children that underwent a lateral column lengthening procedure for pes planovalgus (PPV). Eight children (13 feet) with PPV that had failed non-operative treatment underwent a lateral column lengthening procedure. Pre-operative and post-operative standing AP and lateral radiographs and foot pressure data were obtained. The relationships between the radiographic and foot pressure measurements were investigated. The findings from this study demonstrated strong relationships between these parameters. The relationships seen in this study indicate that the addition of foot pressure analysis provides objective documentation of the improvement in foot pressure distribution following a lateral column lengthening. Also, there is a direct, positive relationship between the key radiographic and foot pressure measurements.

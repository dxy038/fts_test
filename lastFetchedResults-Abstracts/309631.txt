Objective:
The aim of the study was to determine oxidative stress in patients with acute and chronic viral hepatitis B.
Design and methods:
23 (11 F, 12 M) healthy controls, 23 (8 F, 15 M) patients with acute viral hepatitis B (AVHB) and 25 (9 F, 16 M) patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (CVHB) were studied.
Serum malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated dienes (CD), ALT, AST, total and direct bilirubins, β-carotene and whole blood reduced glutathione (GSH) levels of all subjects were measured. In patients with CVHB, these parameters were measured both before and 6 months after treatment with interferon-α (IFN-α).
Results:
MDA, CD, ALT, AST and total and direct bilirubin levels of the patients with AVHB and CVHB before treatment were significantly higher (P < 0.001) whereas GSH and β-carotene levels were lower (P < 0.001) than those of the controls. MDA, CD, GSH, β-carotene, ALT, AST and total and direct bilirubin levels of the patients with CVHB returned approximately to normal levels 6 months after treatment with IFN-α.
Conclusion:
Our results clearly show that patients with AVHB and CVHB are under the influence of increased oxidative stress (MDA and CD were increased) associated with lower levels of some antioxidants (β-carotene and GSH). These impairments return to normal levels after IFN-α treatment of CVHB patients. These findings suggest that antioxidant supplementation might be considered in patients with acute or chronic hepatitis B.

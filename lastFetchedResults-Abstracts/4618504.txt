The main objective of this work is to study design methods of polynomial control laws by pole placement that presents actually smart solutions to many industrial applications. Even if these regulators are widely used, most of their applications concern problems where the reference signal does not vary in time. In this paper, we propose an indirect adaptive controller by fractional order pole placement, and show by mean of simulations of its application on a DC motor, the improvement in systemÂ´s behavior when compared to the classical control scheme with integer order poles.

Reversed field pinch (RFP) is an important toroidal magnetic confinement device. The RFP scientific program can address issues relevant not only for RFP, but also more generally for magnetic confinement fusion. And the rich phenomena associated with the strong magnetic self-organization in RFP provide an unusually close connection to a set of important problems in plasma astrophysics. The objective of this paper is to build the control system and data acquisition system for the RFP called KTX which is in the construction in University of science and technology of China. The data acquisition system and the control system includes three ingredients: the master control system, the data acquisition and storage system, the plasma control system. The master control system is a core part of operation scheduling and Centralized management in the fusion experiments for monitoring the system operating situations, and coordinating operations of each module, synchronizing and inspecting. The data acquisition and storage system includes not only hardware modules such as analog to digital converter but also software platform for acquisition control and data access. The plasma control system is used for the control of plasma parameters during experiments. The design of the operating control system and data acquisition system is based on modularized design thoughts and adopt mainstream hardware platform that is easy to for maintaining and system upgrading.

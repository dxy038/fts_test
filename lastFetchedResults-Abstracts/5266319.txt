This article presents the results of an experiment comparing the effects of engaging movie content on user subjective and objective immersion levels, in two conditions: a Classic TV experience (no Ambilight) and an advanced Ambilight TV experience (Ambilight++TV). We measured subjective and objective immersion levels (SIL and OIL) via self-report questionnaires and respectively physiological signals. In terms of SIL, we found that Ambilight++TV induces higher subjective levels of immersion than ClassicTV reflected by significantly more pronounced stress levels (measured with the VAS method), and by more pronounced increasing trends of arousal and stress levels (measured with the SACL method). In terms of OIL, within each condition, all physiological signals showed increasing trends from passive to engaging movie scenes, with respiration rate statistically significant. Overall Ambilight++ TV registered more pronounced increasing trends in physiological signals than Classic TV. The results of the experiment were used to provide a first concept for a closed-loop bio-feedback system for immersion.

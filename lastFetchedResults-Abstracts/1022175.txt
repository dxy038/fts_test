Background and Objective: Increased and decreased CDK5gene expression regulation, as a protein kinase, is associated with launching death or survival pathways in the nervous system. According to the chronic effects of endurance training on growth germination, neuronal function and improvement ofpathological conditions of neurodegenerative diseases, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of 6-week endurance training on gene expression of CDK5 in sensory neurons of male Wistar rats with diabetic neuropathy.

Materials and Methods: Twenty eight adult male Wistar rats in the weight range of 326.3Â±8.4 g, were randomly divided into four groups including healthy control (C), healthy training (HT), neuropathic control (N) and neuropathic training (NT). Diabetes was induced with one injection of STZ (45mg/kg). Training groups performed 6-week endurance training on the treadmill. Subjects sacrificed 24 hours after last session training. CDK5 gene expression in sensory spinal segments forming the sciatic nerve was measured with Real time technique and calculated using the 2-??CT method. For identifying significant differences between factors, two-way ANOVA method was used.

Results: After 6-week endurance training, CDK5 gene expression in sensory neurons of NT group was significantly lower than the NC group. Also, in comparison with neuropathy control, training led to a significant decrease in blood glucose levels in neuropathic training group.

Conclusion: According to the specific role of CDK5 in neuronal growth or death, our study showed the beneficial effects of chronic endurance exercise on neuronal networks leading to reduced (modification) gene expression of CDK5 in a pathologic condition.

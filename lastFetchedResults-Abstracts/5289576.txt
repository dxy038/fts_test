In this paper, experimental design methodology is used for the on-line tuning of a fuzzy controller dedicated to electrical engineering applications with multi-objective criteria. Our purpose is to improve the input and output system characteristics as well as the quality of electrical power. The desirability notion combines here time dynamic and harmonic criteria for a boost rectifier with unity power factor correction and illustrates the trade-off that has to be made between the different properties.

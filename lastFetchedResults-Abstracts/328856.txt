The objective of this investigation was to assess the effect of substrate manipulationon reducing ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Isolated rat hearts were perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing either (in mM): glucose 11 (G1), glucose 22 (G2), or glucose 11 with either xylitol 11 (GX), mannitol 11 (GM), L-leucine 1 (GL), or L-glutamic acid 2 (GGA), respectively. Hearts were subjected to 10 min of global no-flow ischemia, followed by 20 min of reperfusion. Mean tissue perfusion, oxygen consumption, and peak left ventricular pressure (PLVP) were determined at baseline, in the first minute of regular heart rhythm following ischemia, and after 20 minutes of reperfusion. Reperfusion arrhythmia (in sec) was significantly (all p < 0.05) shorter in GGA (115 ± 33) vs G1 (315 ± 29) and G2 (273 ± 33), and also in GL (161 ± 26) vs G1. Dry/wet heart weight ratios were also greater in GGA (0.20), when compared with G2 (0.16), GX (0.17), GM (0.17), GM (0.17), and GL (0.17) (all p < 0.02), suggesting less cellular/interstitial edema. Percent recovery in PLVP was improved (p < 0.03) in GL (81 ± 2) and GGA (81 ± 2) vs. G2 (71 ± 3), without significant alterations in oxygen consumption. Thus, cardiac IRI can be diminished by substrate manipulation, especially by augmentation of glutamate and leucine, most likely due to an improved anaerobic energy generation and utilization.

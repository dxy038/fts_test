In this paper, a digitally controlled three-phase switch mode power rectifier based on matrix converter is proposed for telecommunication power supply application. Matrix converter has the advantage of bidirectional power flow, controllable input power factor, high reliability, and compact design, and high operating frequency of the system allows the size and weight of the transformer to be reduced. The digital controller is developed by TI DSP TMS320F2812, and a novel solution for digital space vector pulse width modulation signalsÂ´ generation is developed in this paper, SVPWM technique applied to a matrix converter is employed and implemented by CPLD. Experiment results are presented from a three-phase 220 V, DC 48 V output laboratory prototype converter.

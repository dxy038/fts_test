Real-time collaborative editors (RCE) provide computer support for modifying simultaneously shared documents, such as articles, wiki pages and programming source code, by dispersed users. Due to data replication, operational transformation (OT) is considered as the efficient and safe method for consistency maintenance in the literature of collaborative editors. Indeed, it is aimed at ensuring copies convergence even though the usersÂ´s updates are executed in any order on different copies. Unfortunately, existing OT algorithms often fail to achieve this objective. Moreover, these algorithms have limited scalability with the number of users as they use vector time stamps to enforce causality dependency. In this paper, we present a novel framework for managing collaborative editing work in a scalable and decentralized fashion. It may be deployed easily on P2P networks as it supports dynamic groups where users can leave and join at any time.

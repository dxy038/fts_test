Background and Objective: In spite of promising results in treatment of blood diseases by umbilical cord blood cell transplantation, low number of derived stem cells has been a matter of concern. Since platelets extracts has been introduced as a potent mesenchymal stem cell culture supplement, the purpose of current study was to investigate the probable effects of umbilical cord blood platelet lysate (UCB-PL) in proliferation, survival and differentiation of cord blood mononuclear cells.

Materials and Methods: The umbilical cord blood platelet lysate (UCB-PL) was added to cord blood mononuclear cells culture (1Ã—10 6 /mL) in presence of FLT3L, TPO and SCF. The effective dose of UCB-PL, cell viability and differentiation of mononuclear cells were determined by trypan blue staining and colony assay method, respectively. The number of mononuclear cells was measured by flowcytometric analysis of CD133+ CD34+CD38- cells. Quantitative expression of CD 34 was performed by QRT-PCR method.

Results: Combination of 5% of UCB-PL with mentioned cytokines yielded a 12-fold cell proliferation in comparison with control group. A higher concentration of UCB-PL showed cytotoxic effects. CD 34 also increased significantly in group of 5% UCB-PL treated cells. In this particular group, a significant increase of colony forming units granulocytes-erythroid-macrophages-megakaryocyte (CFU-GMMM) and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) were detected. 

Conclusion: Our results indicate that 5% UCB -PL can be used as a supplement in MNC cultured cells and in cord blood hematopoietic stem cells for cell therapy purposes.

This paper studies a cellular network in which base station (BS) locations are modeled using a homogenous spatial Poisson point process, and user locations are modeled using an arbitrary stationary homogenous point process. The objective is to maximize the Coverage-Intensity Product (CIP), which represents the average number of users covered per unit area, under constraints on transmit power, BS intensity and transmit power density (per unit area). Expressions for the CIP are obtained considering two user coverage models that differ from each other depending on the BS-user association. Using these expressions, solutions for the optimization problem are provided. All these results are presented for general bounded path loss models that satisfy some mild conditions. The results are also illustrated using a specific bounded path loss model to provide further insights.

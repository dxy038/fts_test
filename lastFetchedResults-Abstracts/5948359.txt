In this paper, state-of-the-art interpolation algorithms for deinterlacing within a single frame are investigated. Based on ChenÂ´s directional measurements and on the median filter, a novel interpolation algorithm for deinterlacing is proposed. By efficiently estimating the diagonal and vertical directional correlations of the neighboring pixels, the proposed method performs better than existing techniques on different images and video sequences, for both subjective and objective measurements. Additionally, the proposed method has a simple structure with low computation complexity, which therefore makes it simple to implement in hardware.

A complex learning process (CLP) is understood as the result of the dynamic and unanticipated integration of diverse pedagogical approaches in a learning process, based on the collaboration between instructors and learners. Educational modeling languages are used to specify and design learning processes that can be adaptable to the demands of a particular pedagogical context. Based upon IMS service-oriented architectural principles, a framework for learning process composition and execution is presented. The objective of that framework is to enable the dynamic and unanticipated composition of distributed learning services. This is guided by a case study of how this framework can be implemented in a complex learning scenario.

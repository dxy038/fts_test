The objective of this work is to demonstrate the use of acceleration feedback to improve the performance of a maglev system, especially in disturbance attenuation. In the single degree-of-freedom (DOF) system studied here, acceleration feedback has the effect of virtually increasing inertia, damping and stiffness. It is shown that it can be used to increase disturbance rejection without sacrificing tracking performance. Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate that disturbance rejection can be improved with acceleration feedback.

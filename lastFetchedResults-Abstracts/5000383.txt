Summary form only given. It is clear that the time for a common, open ATE has arrived. The high level of technology integration and modularity make an open architecture feasible. The technical and economic challenges involved in testing system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs provide the needed driving force to make the common, open ATE architecture not only feasible but also highly desirable. Deployment of the common, open ATE architecture will require the active involvement of all the significant industry participants, a common objective for a more efficient industry and a strong sense of urgency.

In this paper, a design of control laws for mobile agents intending to accomplish multiple objectives is proposed. The agents wish to reach assigned waypoints and at the same time avoid collisions between one another and with static obstacles. A gradient-based controller is constructed using non-negative objective functions and a multiattribute utility copula. Parameters of the multiattribute utility function represent an agent´s preference towards the given objectives. Simulations were conducted to demonstrate the control law´s ability to accomplish both objectives as well as to illustrate the effects of varying the parameters of the multiattribute utility functions.

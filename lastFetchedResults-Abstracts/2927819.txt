Digital production techniques are already revolutionising the way that radio programmes are made. In a large and diverse organisation, such as the BBC, such revolutions tend to begin in the form of sporadic outbreaks of guerrilla activity: an editing system here, a newsgathering system there, perhaps several incompatible editing systems being used in different parts of the same building. A reasonably healthy situation in terms of creativity but not one which is likely to meet the requirements of accountability and value for money which form the cornerstones of Extending Choice and BBC Policy in the 90Â´s.

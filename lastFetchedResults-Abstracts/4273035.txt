In this paper, we find the best base station placement using a genetic approach. A new representation describing base station placement with a real number is proposed, and new genetic operators are introduced. This new representation can describe not only the locations of the base stations but also the number of those. Considering both coverage and economic efficiency, we also suggest a weighted objective function. Our algorithm is applied to an obvious optimization problem and then is verified. Moreover, our approach is tried in an inhomogeneous traffic density environment. The simulation result proves that the algorithm enables one to find near optimal base station placement and the efficient number of base stations

In this paper we are proposing a wireless sensor network based solution for typical indian city traffic. The objective is to understand and solve the congestion of the chaotic traffic. We are proposing to control and optimize the duration of time a signal is green, and the number of vehicles passing through the junction, in a given interval of time. Our objective is to use WSN to make the traffic signal adaptive to the dynamic traffic flow, so that the number of vehicles passing through the signal is maximized. The analysis of our proposed algorithm and our initial experiment based on simulation, we found that 7% more vehicle can be handled by the same infrastructure. This also means that by using our system model and algorithm, 7% more vehicles will pass through the same junction or on an average each vehicle will save 7% of their waiting time at the respective junction.

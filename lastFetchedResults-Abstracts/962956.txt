
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The use of antioxidants has been considered for the prevention and treatment of ischemic complications, particularly in the brain. Previous study showed a reduction in cell death in brain ischemia before and after treatment with antioxidants. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of olive oil on Temporal cortical cell death following ischemia reperfusion injury. 
METHODS: This study was performed on 21 adult male BALB/c mice (35-40 g). Experimental design includes three groups: intact group (n=7), ischemic control (n=7), treatment groups with olive oil (n=7). The mice treated with olive oil (180 micro liter) as pre- treatment for a week. Then, ischemia in temporal cortex lob induced by common carotid artery occlusion (for 15 minutes) and following the reduction in inflammation (a week), the mice post-treated with olive oil. Nissl staining applied to counting necrotic cells and Tunnel kit was used to quantify apoptotic cell death in temporal cortex lob.
FINDINGS: There was a significant increase in cell death in temporal cortex lob in ischemic samples in compared to control group (30-35 cells increased in treatment group compared to ischemia group) (p < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in cell death rate in treatment group in compared to ischemia group (50-55 cells decreased in ischemia group compared to control group) (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that olive oil consumption significantly reduced cell death following ischemia reperfusion injury.

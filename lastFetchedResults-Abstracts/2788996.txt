We study co-primary spectrum sharing concept in small cell multiuser networks. Downlink transmission is considered with Rayleigh fading in interfering broadcast channel. Multiple-input-single-output (MISO) system is considered in two small cells. The sum rate maximization problem is studied in two cells having multiple users with multiple subcarriers. Zero-forcing (ZF) precoders are considered at both base stations. The problem becomes non-convex then and we factor the main objective problem into two subproblems. First subproblem is multiuser with subcarriers allocation where we assume that each subcarrier can be allocated to multiple users. Gale-Shapley algorithm is proposed for subcarrier allocation problem. Second subproblem is where ZF precoders are employed at both base stations for allocating power. It leads to water-filling based power allocation for both base stations.

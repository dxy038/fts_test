Dynamic scales allow vehicles to be weighed in motion and are therefore termed Weigh In Motion (WIM) scales. The objective of measurement is the quantitative determination of the vehicleÂ´s individual static axle loads and its gross weight. This work provides a description of fusion process in WIM systems with different degrees of complexity: from the simplest, equipped with only two load sensors, to the most complex ones, comprising a plurality of sensors of various physical quantities. The paper presents an analysis of elements of cooperative and complementary fusion and fusion performed at the data, properties and decisions levels. It also deals with issues relating to the selection of sensors and their number in WIM systems, selection of sensors for Multi-Sensor WIM systems and effects of external factors on weighing results.

Shows how it is possible to increase the precision on the slant angle, for a special kind of texture: regular macro textures. It is a theoretical study. The objective is to obtain a good knowledge of the shape from texture methods behavior. So, we combine two approaches. First we use a technique based on a wavelets decomposition and an interpolation of a local scales map. At the end of this first stage, we have a value for the tilt and the slant angles. Then, with these values, we extract all the texels from the plane and we look for the vanishing line. With this line equation, we compute again the tilt and slant angles values. So we obtain two sets of plane parameters. The comparison between these two sets shows that the use of vanishing line method always leads us to better results.

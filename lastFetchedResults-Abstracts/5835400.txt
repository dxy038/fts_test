A full duplex optical module is a key device for 1.3/1.55 /spl mu/m bidirectional wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical subscriber systems and reducing its cost is particularly important. The most promising way to do this is hybrid integration with a planar lightwave circuit (PLC) platform, where a laser diode (LD) and a receiver photodiode (R-PD) are directly mounted on a compact PLC wafer board. However, when this technology is applied to a full duplex optical module, the signal crosstalk between the LD and PD is a severe problem, because the LD is located near the PD on the platform. This paper describes a full duplex optical module configuration on a PLC platform that suppresses the signal crosstalk and the first demonstration of full duplex operation on a hybrid integrated optical module using a PLC platform operation at a speed of 156 Mbit/s.

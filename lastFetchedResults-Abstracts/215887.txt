Background: Hydatid disease is a major world health problem and pulmonary hydatidosis is a widespread disease. It is
presented with different clinical manifestations. In order to determine the most clinical manifestation, diagnostic methods
and clinical outcome in our patients, we conducted this study.
Methods: Forty-nine patients with pulmonary hydatid cysts who were admitted to our hospital in Zahedan (Southeast of
Iran) between 1990 and 2005, evaluated. We retrospectively reviewed the patients’ symptomatology, diagnostic studies,
treatment options, and morbidity as well as mortality rate.
Results: The ages of the patients ranged from 16 to 68 years (mean 43 years). Seventy–five percent of patients were from
male gender. Hemoptysis was one of the most common clinical presentations in our patients. Radiological studies were the
main diagnostic tool. The correct preoperative diagnosis was made in 92% of the patients by chest roentgenogram plus chest
CT-Scan. Eighty seven percent of patients were treated by surgical route. Only one patient was expired during surgery.
Conclusion: Upon the results emerged from this study, hemoptysis is one of the most prevalent clinical manifestation in
patients with pulmonary hydatidosis and it can mimic pulmonary tuberculosis in endemic area.

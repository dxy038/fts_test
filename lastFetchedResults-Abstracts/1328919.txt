An advanced numerical simulation model for the thermal and fluid dynamic optimization of hermetic reciprocating compressors has been developed. The quality of the numerical solution has been verified by means of a critical analysis of the different sources of errors, and validated through an extensive experimental comparison. This work is focused on presenting different parametric studies of hermetic reciprocating compressors, based on the numerical simulation model developed. Results presented show the influence of different aspects (geometry, motor, valves, working conditions, etc.) on the basis of the meaningful non-dimensional parameters, which describe the compressor behaviour (volumetric and isentropic efficiency, coefficient of performance, etc.). The idea of this paper is to show the possibilities offered by the simulation model and its final objective, a better understanding of the thermal and fluid dynamic compressor behaviour to improve the design of these equipments.

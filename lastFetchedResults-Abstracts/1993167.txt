The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of storage pH (3 and 7) and biopolymer emulsifier type (Whey protein isolate (WPI), Modified starch (MS) and Gum arabic (GA)) on the physical and oxidative stability of rice bran oil-in-water emulsions. All three emulsifiers formed small emulsion droplets (d32 &lt; 0.5 μm) when used at sufficiently high levels: 0.45%, 1% and 10% for WPI, MS and GA, respectively. The droplets were relatively stable to droplet growth throughout storage (d32 &lt; 0.6 μm after 20 days), although there was some evidence of droplet aggregation particularly in the MS-stabilized emulsions. The electrical charge on the biopolymer-coated lipid droplets depended on pH and biopolymer type: −13 and −27 mV at pH 3 and 7 for GA; −2 and −3 mV at pH 3 and 7 for MS; +37 and −38 mV at pH 3 and 7 for WPI. The oxidative stability of the emulsions was monitored by measuring peroxide (primary products) and hexanal (secondary products) formation during storage at 37 °C, for up to 20 days, in the presence of a pro-oxidant (iron/EDTA). Rice bran oil emulsions containing MS- and WPI-coated lipid droplets were relatively stable to lipid oxidation, but those containing GA-coated droplets were highly unstable to oxidation at both pH 3 and 7. The results are interpreted in terms of the impact of the electrical characteristics of the biopolymers on the ability of cationic iron ions to interact with emulsified lipids. These results have important implications for utilizing rice bran oil, and other oxidatively unstable oils, in commercial food and beverage products.

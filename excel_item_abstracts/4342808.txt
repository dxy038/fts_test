This paper deals with the blind source separation (BSS) problem in the overdetermined case, i.e. the number of receive antennas is larger than that of sources. First, a method, which converts the over-determined BSS into complete BSS, is presented. Then a maximum ratio combining (MRC) based BSS algorithm (MRC-FastICA) is proposed. The proposed algorithm includes source separation, estimated signals classification and MRC of multiple estimated signals corresponding to a source signal. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain diversity gain, and has better performance than traditional methods.

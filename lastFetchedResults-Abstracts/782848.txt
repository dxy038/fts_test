The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of non-surgical embryo collection
in goats. Five lactating Saanen goats were tested alternately in a cross-over design for two
treatments (T1 and T2). In both treatments, intravaginal progesterone devices were inserted
(day 0/6 p.m.) and removed six days later (day 6/18:00 p.m.) and 22.5  g cloprostenol were
administered by intravulvosubmucosal via (day 0). From day 4 (18:00 p.m.), goats received
six decreasing doses of FSH (250–400 IU) at 12 h interval. Three doses of 50 mg flunixin
meglumine were administered on days 9, 10, and 11. In T1 and T2, animals received two
doses of saline or 250 mg of rbST on day 0 and on first detection of estrus, respectively.
Goats were mated until the end of estrus and uteri were flushed by cervical route seven
days after first mating. The embryo collection interval was 60 days. Percentage of flushing
medium recovered was close to 100% in both treatments. Total number of ova (18.4 ± 9.4
and 15.7 ± 11.0) and viable embryos (13.4 ± 4.1 and 8.2 ± 3.0) were similar (P > 0.05) for
T1 and T2, respectively. Short-term progesterone protocol was efficient for superovulation
in lactating Saanen goats but association with rbST did not enhance embryo recovery or
quality. Non surgical flushing by cervical via was efficient to recover flushing medium and
embryos in goats.

This paper presents a new fuzzy linear programming (FLP) approach to determine the multiobjective power dispatch problem by taking into account fuel cost and environmental impact of NO<sub>x</sub> emission. The FLP technique first separately optimizes each objective. To further offer the best compromise solution out of the noninferiority domain obtained by the FLP based operator, a preference index of a distance membership function is used to aid the power system operator to adjust the generation levels in a most economic manner but also with minimal impact on the environment. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on a 10-bus 5-generator system. Numerical results reveal that the FLP is a promising and efficient approach for dealing with the multiobjective nature of the power dispatch problem

A dual-band bidirectional high gain dipole array antenna for WLAN (2.4/5.8 GHz) applications is proposed and analysed. The array antenna is composed of four elements. Each element is a double-sided printed dipole which is fed with a balanced twin transmission line. Measured results agree very well with simulation results. According to the measured results, the bandwidth with a VSWR less than two is about 400 and 1100 MHz in the two bands, respectively. Good shaped patterns are also achieved. The measured gains for the 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands are between 4.8-6 and 6-8.8 dBi, respectively.

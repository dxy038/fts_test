In this paper, a diode bridge with two power switches is adopted to achieve single phase dual output ac-dc-rectifier. The main objective is to obtain the unity power factor with less harmonic distortion. Hysteresis current controller and fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are designed and compared for the application of a single-phase dual output ac-to-dc converter. Compared with the hysteresis current control (HCC) technique; fuzzy logic gives better steady state performance such as high power factor and low harmonic distortion. Closed loop analysis with HCC and FLC is presented where the line current is driven to follow the reference sinusoidal current. The high power factor (PF) and low current total harmonic distortion are verified by software simulation.

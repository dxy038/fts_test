In this paper, a multi-objective microgrid reconfiguration model is proposed with two aims of minimizing the operation cost and maximizing power supply reliability after analyzing the influencing factors like the timing characteristics of daily power output of wind turbines and photovoltaic generators, as well as microgrid load and farmers load outside the microgrid. Microgrid battery charge and discharge, the power balance and micro-powers output constraints are formed simultaneously. The mathematical model is realized based on NSGA- II. The simulation results show that the microgrid reconfiguration schemes presented can keep morerural loads from the impact of power failure and make good performance on economy and security during the calculating of multi-objectives.

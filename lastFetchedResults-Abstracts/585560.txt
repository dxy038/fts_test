In this paper, optimal Congest Management
(CM) problem by the Vector Evaluated Particle Swarm
Optimization (VEPSO) in the deregulated electricity
market is present. The CM problem is formulated as an
optimization problem according to the generator
sensitivity by objective function to minimizing redispatch
cost which is solved by the VEPSO technique
that has a strong ability to find the most optimistic
results. In the proposed VEPSO technique, generators are
choosing based on their sensitivity for efficient utilization
on line congested. The task of optimal rescheduling
active powers of participating generators to reduce
transmission line congestion is attempted by VEPSO. The
proposed algorithm applied on different test standard
power system. The effectiveness of the proposed method
is compared with CPSO, PSO-TVAC and PSO-TVIW.
Results showed the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

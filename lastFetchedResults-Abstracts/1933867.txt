The main objective of this review is to provide current information regarding non-infectious risk factors associated with stillborn piglets. These factors can be roughly categorized as genetic, maternal, piglet and environmental factors, but also interactions exist between several factors. An understanding of this multifactorial problem should help practitioners and farmers implementing a more effective farrowing management to obtain a high reproductive efficiency. From the papers studied in this review, it can be concluded that litter size, parity, sow's body condition and farrowing supervision/birth assistance seems to be the most relevant risk factors associated with stillborn piglets.

In this paper the facility layout problem is being solved for a job shop type layout. The objective may be stated as the formulation of an algorithmic approach, which will allow plant layout problems to be solved for multiple factors, handle qualitative and quantitative factors similarly, and a meta-heuristic, which will generate a good plant layout quickly, A new optimization technique known as ant colony optimization technique is gaining momentum, it is a multiagent approach, and is found effective in solving combinatorial optimization problem.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms in pregnancy that occur during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. A way for relief is consumption of natural products. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ginger powder as capsule on nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.
METHODS: Forty four selected women were entered in a double - blind randomized cross-over trial. Each woman swallowed capsules containing either 250 mg powder of ginger root or starch T.I.D during the first 3 days of the treatment period. After a 3 days wash-out, the alternate medication was given in the second 3 days period.
FINDINGS: Findings showed that median change in nausea (duration, severity, frequency) and vomiting (severity, frequency) after consumption of ginger capsule was significantly greater than placebo (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Powdered root of ginger in daily doses of 750 mg during 3 days is better than placebo in reducing the nausea and vomiting.

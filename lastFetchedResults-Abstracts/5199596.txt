The modernization of GPS signal has commenced with the launch of next generation satellites (IIR-M). The principal objective of modernising GPS signal is to improve the overall performance of the system, in terms of improving the accuracy, providing better immunity to RF interference and multipath and better atmospheric corrections. These are done by providing additional coded civil signals on multiple carrier frequencies. This paper presents the various acquisition and tracking strategies of the Modernised GPS L2C signal.

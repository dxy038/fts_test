He wants to know whether the chain of events in the past is a disconnected and aimless group of incidents or whether behind such chains there is an end to be discovered.

This paper aims to study and analyze the three primary questions and their answers posed by theoretical philosophy of history from the viewpoint of the philosopher â€“ jurist, Mohaghgheghgh-e Sabzevari.

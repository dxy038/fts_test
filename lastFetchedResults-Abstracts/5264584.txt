Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a communication technique that divides a communication channel into a number of equally spaced frequency bands. Despite of many advantages of OFDM, one major problem which degrades its performance is the high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Nowadays; clipping has become a well known technique in reducing PAPR due to its simplicity. However, this technique has caused the degradation of bit error rate (BER) and enhanced and enhanced the growth of out of band radiation (OOBR) which has led to the degradation of OFDM overall performance. In this paper, an OFDM system with enhanced clipping technique is designed, evaluated and optimized. The system is designed with the objective to further reduce the high peak average power ratio (PAPR) value by means of clipping while minimizing the negative effects caused by clipping. The optimum values of designed parameters have resulted in maximum PAPR reduction and OOBR suppression capability of 16 dB and 70 dB respectively at the cut-off BER of 5.75 times 10<sup>-4</sup>.

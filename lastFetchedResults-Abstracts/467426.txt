Objective: Recent clinical studies suggested that intrapartum maternal fever is a strong independent risk factor for neonatal encephalopathy. With use of a well-studied rat model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encepalopathy, this study investigated the hypothesis that intraischemic hyperthermia accelerates and worsens brain injury in immature animals and examined whether apoptotic cell death machinery is involved in the underlying mechanisms. Study Design: Seven-day-old rats underwent a combination of left common carotid artery ligation and exposure to 8% oxygen for 15 minutes (n = 32 rats). During the 15-minute hypoxic insult, body temperature was elevated to 40°C in 16 animals (hyperthermic hypoxic insult group), and was maintained at 37°C in 16 animals (normothermic hypoxic insult group). Then both groups were placed in the same chamber in a water bath at 37°C for 24 hours and finally returned to the mothers. Caspase-3-like activity was assessed 36 hours after the hypoxic-ischemic insult. One week later, microtubule-associated protein-2 immunostaining was used to examine neuronal damage. Results: Intraischemic hyperthermia was shown to activate the caspase-3 activity 36 hours after hypoxia-ischemia while caspase-3 was activated insignificantly in the normothermic hypoxic insult group at that time. The hyperthermic hypoxic insult group also showed a reduced microtubule-associated protein-2-positive area 7 days after hypoxia-ischemia compared with that in the normothermia group. Conclusion: Hyperthermia during hypoxia-ischemia makes the immature brain inordinately susceptible to hypoxic-ischemic insult and causes brain injury, even if hypoxic-ischemic insult is so mild that it causes no or little injury by itself. This effect may be mediated by the escalation of the apoptotic cell death pathway in the immature animal. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:768-73.)

Indicating the places where the signals read from the surface of the head by means of EEG electrode systems originate is a crucial problem in BCI. Locating the sources of EEG signals (signal generators), i.e. indicating the places in the brain that the signals come from is the objective of the inverse problem. The two algorithms based on the methods used in the inverse problem: the linear least squares method and the LORETA method were compared. An analysis of the accuracy of locating the sources generating EEG signals on the basis of the two above mentioned methods was carried out with the use of the MATLAB programme. The findings made it possible to determine both the complexity of calculation involved in the methods under consideration and to compare the accuracy of the results obtained.

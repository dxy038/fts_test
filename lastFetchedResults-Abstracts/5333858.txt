Traditional peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks such as Chord, CAN, Pastry and Tapestry provide a type of novel platform for a variety of scalable and decentralized distributed applications, whilst they bring tremendous delay to network routing due to less care of network topology structure. In this paper, we propose a structured P2P system with low network delay, named Cone, which is extended to enable physical topology aware and applicable to routing on the base of Chord. In the Cone, nodes are divided into groups according to prefixes of their identifiers, finger tables are set bidirectional, and associated pointers are indicated to the nearest nodes in relevant groups; By landmark+RTT method proximity information is generated and proximity neighbor selection is applied to exploit proximity information; And the routing algorithms, node arrival and departure mechanisms, and fault tolerant are designed and tested. The results of simulation experiments suggest that the ConeÂ´s performance is obviously improved in the delay of routing and the hops of overlay network by contrast with the one of Chord.

A traffic light controller takes as input an estimation of the number of vehicles entering the intersection and produces as output a light plan, with the objective to reduce the traffic jam. The quality of the input traffic estimation is a key consideration on the performance of the traffic light controller. The advent of Wireless Sensor Networks, with their relatively low deployment and operation price, led to the development of several sensor-based architectures for intersection monitoring. We show in this paper that the solutions proposed in the literature are unrealistic in terms of communication possibilities and that they do not allow a measure of the vehicular queue length at a lane level. Based on extensive experimental results, we propose an energy efficient, low cost and lightweight multihop wireless sensor network architecture to measure with a good accuracy the vehicle queue length, in order to have a more precise vision of traffic at the intersection. Associated challenges are then discussed, such as self-configuration, routing and energy harvesting, which should be addressed in order to reduce the cost of the proposed solution and to improve the performance of the target application.

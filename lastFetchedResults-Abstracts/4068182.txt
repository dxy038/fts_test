Secure multiparty protocols have been proposed to enable noncolluding parties to cooperate without a trusted server. Even though such protocols prevent information disclosure other than the objective function, they are quite costly in computation and communication. The high overhead motivates parties to estimate the utility that can be achieved as a result of the protocol beforehand. In this paper, we propose a look-ahead approach, specifically for secure multiparty protocols to achieve distributed k-anonymity, which helps parties to decide if the utility benefit from the protocol is within an acceptable range before initiating the protocol. The look-ahead operation is highly localized and its accuracy depends on the amount of information the parties are willing to share. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

This paper looks into the energy efficiency optimization problem of electric vehicle driven by four independent motors by developing an optimizing torque distribution strategy based on the motor efficiency map. Firstly analyzing the efficiency characteristic of the driven motor and deriving the optimizing objective function, considering the limitation of the road adhesion force, and the torque distribution coefficient is got by numerical computation. Simulation test is carried out on different adhesion coefficient road and over the ECE(Economic Commission for Europe) based on the Matlab/Simulink platform. The simulation results certify the effectiveness of this strategy.

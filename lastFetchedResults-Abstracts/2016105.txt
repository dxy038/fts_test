Lockstitch sewing machine is one of the most
common apparel industrial machines. The thread take-up
lever mechanism of a sewing machine has an important role
for proper stitch forming and smooth working of the
machine. Acquiring a mechanism with optimized geometry is
of great importance to reach this goal. Therefore, in this
study the optimization of the thread take-up lever mechanism
with respect to some important features such as the optimal
path of the coupler point and variation of coupler point
acceleration (jerk) is presented. Modification of the objective
function with respect to the jerk is applied to assure smooth
movement of the thread take-up lever during sewing process.
For this purpose, the imperialistic competitive algorithm is
used to find the optimal link lengths of the take-up lever
mechanism. The analysis results present further verify that
the coupler point jerk in the optimized mechanism in the
horizontal direction has been decreased about 52 percent
without any conflict in the consistent operation of different
parts of the sewing machine.

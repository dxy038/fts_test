This paper gives a Bliss-type multiplier rule for general constrained variational
problems with time delay. Our formulation allows the time delay terms and their
derivatives to be present in both the objective functional and the equality and
inequality constraint equations. Our major results include a Lagrange Multiplier
Rule involving Euler]Lagrange equations for delay differential equations and
transversality conditions. Of special note is that these results will be used in later
work by the authors to obtain new analytical techniques to solve general constrained
problems involving delay differential equations for the Calculus of Variations
and for Optimal Control Theory. They will also lead to new general, accurate,
and efficient numerical methods to solve these important problems where no such
methods exist at this time. Thus, for the first time, we will be able to solve this
important class of problems obtaining analytic solutions for simpler problems and
accurate numerical results for more complex problems when such a solution exists.

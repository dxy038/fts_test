The objective of the present work is to evaluate the potential co-fermentation of hydrolysate from water prehydrolysis of Eucalyptus wood and cassava pulp for bioethanol production. The hydrolysate composed of 49.16 g/L glucose, 16.99 g/L xylose, and 6.99 g/L galactose, which was obtained from hydrolysis of the mixture by &#945;-amylase (Termamyl<sup>&#174;</sup> 120L, 20000 IU/mL) and dilute sulfuric acid subsequently, was used for ethanol production by SHY07-1 yeast without prior detoxification and nutrient supplementation. A final ethanol concentration of 24.55 g/L was achieved, corresponding to an ethanol yield of 0.40 g/g with a fermentation efficiency of 74.54% and an ethanol productivity of 0.20 g/(L h). The results confirmed the feasibility of co-fermentation of these two waste materials for bioconversion to ethanol.

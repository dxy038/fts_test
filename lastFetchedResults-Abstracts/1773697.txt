Summary
terine contraception is the most cost-effective reversible method of contraception today, but its mechanism of action is not well understood. Our objective was to investigate immunohistochemical distribution patterns of αv, α3, β1 integrins in women using a copper T380 intrauterine device (IUD) for different periods of time to obtain insight into the role of integrins in intrauterine contraception. Endometrial biopsies were obtained from patients using T Cu380A IUD in follicular and luteal phases and in menopausal women grouped according to the period of time of IUD use (group 1: &lt;3 year, and group 2: ⩾3 years). Each group consisted of 10 patients, with a total number of 60 patients. Labelling intensity of all integrins, except for β1 which increased in the follicular phase, were decreased in women who used IUD for ⩾3 years when compared with group 1 in the follicular and luteal phases and in the menopause. We conclude that long-term use of IUD affects integrin expression in endometrium not only in follicular and luteal phases of premenopausal women but also in postmenopausal women. Copper IUD can inhibit binding of integrins to the extracellular matrix and it may cause inhibition of the implantation stage, which is crucial for pregnancy.

Long Term Evolution (LTE) network planning is a very important and challenging task. It requires careful attention from all service providers since it affects the cost and the performance of the network and its services. In order to be able to plan a good network, the traffic provided for network planning has to include as many realistic parameters as possible. Previous network planning approaches tend to collect measurements regardless of how time consuming it is considered, while others find it easier to assume or predict values. The main objective of this paper is to introduce a traffic model that considers different realistic parameters that can be used for the planning of LTE networks. To that end, a set of equations is proposed to generate reasonable traffic profiles while considering various practical aspects such as signaling, bandwidth, busy hour session attempts and number of simultaneous bearers.

The problem of optimum reconfiguration with
FACTS devices planning in distribution systems is a task
that must be solved in an optimal manner for distribution
companies. Also, FACTS devices such as Static VAR
Compensator also have been planned for loss reduction
and voltage profile improvement in steady state
conditions. This problem has been modeled as a nonlinear
and multi objective optimization problem based on
a multi-stage hieratical optimization problem to improve
power system voltage stability margin and reduce losses.
This reconfiguration algorithm starts with a radial
topology by a theoretical approach based on the Graph
concept and Matroid theory. The presented approach is
useful to avoid tedious mesh checks for the topology
constraint validation. Also, the voltage stability index is
calculated to evaluate static voltage stability security
margin. This calculation is done for each configuration
pattern with defined SVCs planning. A toolbox has been
developed to recognize loadability limit.

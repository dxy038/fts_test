Sketching With Words may provide a scientific basis for human face recognition system by simulating the forensic sketch expert in the discipline of computational forensic. In this paper we have used fuzzy geometry for defining as well as measuring the different types of noses. In proposed work three types of noses small, medium, and large have considered. The nose has considered as a fuzzy triangle. Consist of three fuzzy lines, sum of internal angles, and length of nose. The proper aggregation of these five parameters may generate a nose of desired degree of OR-ness. The concept of fuzzy granule has been applied for modeling onlookerÂ´s mind set. The Minimal Variability, Maximum Entropy, Chi Square, Least Square Deviation, and Minimizing Distance from Extreme Point nonlinear Ordered Weighted Aggregation objective models have used for estimating the fuzzy validity of triangular nose. The results show that, the values of f-validity of noses generated by Minimizing Distance from Extreme Point model are closer to desire degree of OR-ness.

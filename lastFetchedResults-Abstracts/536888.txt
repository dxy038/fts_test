In this paper we present a new method for voice disorders classification based on multilayer neural network. Theprocessing algorithm is based on a hybrid technique which uses the wavelets energy coefficients as input of the multilayerneural network. The training step uses a speech database of several pathological and normal voices collected from thenational hospital “Rabta - Tunis” and was conducted in a supervised mode for discrimination of normal and pathology voicesand in a second step classification between neural and vocal pathologies (Parkinson, Alzheimer, laryngeal, dyslexia…).Several simulation results will be presented in function of the disease and will be compared with the clinical diagnosis in orderto have an objective evaluation of the developed tool

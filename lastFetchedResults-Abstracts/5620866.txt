The efficiency and quality of product agile design (PAD) is essentially about designer as well as in a rapidly changing and strongly competitive environment. The primary objective of this fundamental research will be to propose the conception of product agile design management (PADM), which designed specially for design affairs management of product agile design. The author carried on deep research on PADM, and found out an effective management model. Furthermore, the author developed PADM system. The PADM system not only could be used in managing a design group, but also could accomplish the management work in connection with lots of groups in different places. The proposition of PADM perfected the theoretical system of design management (DM), and made the DM more flexible and practical. It had a positive function in promoting the development of DM theory in our country. Additionally, because that product agile design involves more than 80% product design cases in small and medium enterprises, and more than 60% product design cases in design companies, and more than 95% product design cases in universities and design colleges, the research on PADM can promote the effective merger of design resources, enhance the quality of design, and improve design efficiency. Finally, the PADM system was developed to realize the application in the process of quick product design.

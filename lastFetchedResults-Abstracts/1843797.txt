To improve the construction efficiency of the Longtan Hydropower Project, this paper studies the multi-mode resourceconstrained
project scheduling problem in its Drilling Grouting Construction Project. A multiple objective decision making model
with bi-random coefficients is first proposed for this practical problem to cope with hybrid uncertain environment where twofold
randomness exists. Subsequently, to deal with the uncertainties, the chance constraint operator is introduced and the equivalent
crisp model is derived. Furthermore, the particular nature of our model motivates us to develop particle swarm ptimization
algorithm for the equivalent crisp model. Finally, the results generated by computer highlight the performances of the proposed
model and algorithm in solving large-scale practical problems.

Abrasive flow machining (AFM) is a unique machining method used to achieve high surface quality on inner, difficult-to-access and on outside contours. Using AFM, it is possible to realise predefined edge rounding on any brittle or hard material. AFM is easy to integrate in an automated manufacturing environment. The abrasive medium applied during AFM is a fluid consisting of a polymer which carries silicon carbide or super-abrasive grains. With a specified pressure and temperature, this fluid flows in alternating directions along the contours of the workpiece resulting in an abrasive effect. AFM is also well suited to process advanced ceramic materials. Especially advanced ceramics are playing increasingly a significant role as a substitute for metals. However the high costs for the inevitable finishing process on ceramics prevent a more frequent use. This paper represents the technological results of a research-project discovering the fundamental principles of AFM on advanced ceramic materials such as a correlation between flow processes, surface formation and edge rounding. Furthermore an insight into a process model is given, which was developed using modern simulation techniques. The overall objective of this approach is to anticipate work results like surface quality and edge rounding on any user-defined geometry.

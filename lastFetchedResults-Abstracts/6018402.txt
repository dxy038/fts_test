This paper describes a new research and development program called multi-dimensional, assured, robust communications for an on-the-move network (MARCON-i) that recently began at Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Ft. Monmouth NJ. The MARCON-i effort focused on the development and integration of two complementary networking technologies needed to achieve increased bandwidth and greater connectivity on the battlefield: proactive diverse link selection (PAD-LS) and directional networking technologies (DNT). The first technology area, PAD-LS, was being developed to enable automatic link selection over multiple, widely varying transmission paths to bypass congestion and/or outages. This is an important element needed to enhance both communications survivability and network capacity. DNT was envisioned to integrate advanced directional networking technologies to provide additional capacity, anti jam/low probability of intercept (AJ/LPI), and network robustness. The program began in FY 2005 and was scheduled to run through FY 2009. Based on shifts in research and development priorities, the MARCON-i program was refocused to concentrate on the challenge of limited network reliability resulting from the inability to make optimal use of all available link types, simultaneously. The resulting program will look to leverage the PAD-LS technologies investigated under the MARCON-i program. This new program is currently entitled the proactive integrated link selection for network robustness (PILSNER) army technology objective (demonstration) (ATO(D)) program and is scheduled to run from FY 2006 through FY 2009.

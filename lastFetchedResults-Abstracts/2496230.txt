Objective
Neural tube defects (NTDs) are the most common congenital defects of central
nervous system due to neural tube closure deficit during the third and fourth
weeks of gestational age. Our study was performed to detect the incidence and
risk factors of NTDs in Kashan, center of Iran.
Material & Methods
This case-control study was done on all pregnancies with NTD affected
neonates (n=91) and 209 pregnancies with normal neonates from February
2007 to December 2012 in three hospitals in Kashan, center of Iran. Annual and
the mean incidence of NTDs were calculated. Risk factors including neonatal
gender, maternal age, gravidity, maternal abortion history, maternal gestational
diabetes (GDM), folic acid use, familial marriage, maternal body mass index
(BMI), birth season and family history of NTDs were evaluated by interview
with mothers. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to
analyze the risk factors.
Results
The mean incidence of NTDs was 2.33 per 1000 births. The multivariate analysis
indicated that maternal history of abortion (OR: 4.9, CI: 1.9-12.8), and maternal
obesity (OR: 5.4, CI: 1.3-21.8) were significantly associated with NTDs.
Conclusion
 Maternal history of abortion and BMI were the major risk factors of NTDs.

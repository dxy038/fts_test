The objective of this project is to support the healthcare networks by proposing the reliable transmission protocol for the transmission of emergency signals. Patient monitoring systems are gaining their importance as the fast-growing global elderly population increases demands for caretaking and to look after them. These systems use wireless technologies in adhoc environment to transmit vital signs for medical evaluation. In a multihop Wi-Fi network, the existing systems usually use broadcast or multicast schemes to increase the reliability of signals transmission; however, significantly higher network traffic and end-to-end transmission delay are the results observed from the above schemes. In our project, a reliable transmission protocol is presented based on anycast routing for wireless patient monitoring. Proposed scheme automatically selects the closest data receiver in an anycast group as a destination to reduce the transmission latency as well as the control overhead. Using Optimizing Route Request Response Technique as a contribution, control overhead is minimized in the proposed protocol. The new protocol also shortens the latency of path recovery by initiating route recovery from the intermediate routers of the original path. Based on the reliable transmission scheme, signal from the fall detection system is transmitted. Performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated using Network Simulator (ns-2) and compared with existing basic AODV routing protocol. Simulation results prove that the proposed protocol is apt for emergency signal transmission with reliability.

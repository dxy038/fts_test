Introduction & Objective: Febrile seizures are the most common form of convulsions in childhood. Rectal diazepam in solution is very suitable for acute treatment of febrile convulsions. Furthermore, diazepam suppositories are used prophylactically. The aims of this study were to prepare a suitable and efficient formulation of diazepam suppository and to elucidate the influence of suppository base on dissolution rate using various techniques.
Materials & Methods:Suppositories containing diazepam (5 mg) were manufactured with Witepsol H35, PEG300 plus PEG400o, PEG1aoo plus PEGaooa and PEGipoo plus PEG5ooo, by the fusion method. Physical characteristics of suppositories such as weight variation, liquefaction time, mechanical strength, content uniformity and percent of drug released were studied and compared to a brand of diazepam suppository. Dissolution testing was done by three methods: the USP basket, paddle and dialysis cell.
Results:The results showed that the release of drug from PEG1000+4000

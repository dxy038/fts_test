A comparison is made between the performance of two difference network architectures to implement multichannel-metropolitan area networks (M-MANs). Both networks, the bidirectional Manhattan street network (BMSN) and the shuffle net (SN), are assumed with connectivity degree four. Performance under investigation includes throughput, average delay and packet loss. In the authors´ model, user´s attachments to network nodes are equipped with input and output buffers and performance depends on buffer sizes. The network reliability is taken into account and the behavior of both networks under given link failure occurrences is noted. The comparison is based on simulation results. Pros and cons of the two M-MAN architectures are pointed out in the discussion of the results

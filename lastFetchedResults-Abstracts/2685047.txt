We present an operation-switchable bidirectional ring-cavity pulsed fiber laser incorporating a carbon-nanotube-based saturable absorber and a polarization-dependent four-port circulator. By manipulating the intra-cavity polarization state of light, two sets of mode-locked pulses in terms of fundamental repetition rate and pulse width can be achieved separately from the same laser cavity. In clockwise direction, the laser generates mode-locked output pulse train with a pulse width of 600 fs and a fundamental repetition rate of 12.68 MHz. While in counter-clockwise direction, the laser generates mode-locked pulses with a pulse width of 480 fs and a fundamental repetition rate of 16.46 MHz. Furthermore, the same laser cavity can produce bidirectional Q-switched output pulse trains with synchronized repetition rate. Such synchronized repetition rate is linearly proportional to pump power. The results show a multi-functional pulsed fiber laser with selectable output pulse trains.

Heterogeneous multi-processor platforms are an interesting option to satisfy the computational performance of dynamic multi-media applications at a reasonable energy cost for embedded portable systems. In this paper is shown different inter frame compression algorithms for different GOPs (group of pictures) and different trade offs in terms of power consumption/time execution, image quality/bit rate. This study gives information about this multi-dimension optimization objective. Taking into account packet and transmit data through a wireless channel. The objective is to adapt this amount of compressed data to transmit it through the channel bandwidth optimizing system performance

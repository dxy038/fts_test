Recent advances in consumer electronics, personal computing and mobile applications have created a great need for wireless communications at very high data rates over short distances. Ultra Wideband radio is an example of enabling technologies for 4G communication systems that offer great promise to satisfy the growing necessity for low-cost wireless communications at short-range for High-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks by providing data rates of several hundred Mbps. The objective of this paper is to utilize M-ary PSK Trellis Coded Modulation based Multi-Band Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing communication system as a means of achieving higher throughput and range improvement over realistic multipath-fading environments as specified by the modified Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) UWB channel models in terms of coded BER, link PER, received SNR and transmission range.

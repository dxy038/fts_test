An easy optimization methodology for design of permanent magnet synchronous motors is presented. The analyzed structure is a permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor (PMA-SRM). For a motor design optimization the parameters are the geometric and electrical magnitudes. The proposed method of optimization is divided into two parts: global optimization (geometric parameters) and local optimization (electrical optimization). The main objective is to minimize the motor cost. The performance computations are made with Finite Element Method. Finally, the method is used to compare the motors for two types of permanent magnets (NdFeB and Ferrite).

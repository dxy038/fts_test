Trade-offs in efficiency, equity and acceptability arise as a central feature in traffic management. TodayÂ´s urban traffic network management strategies focus on overall system performance and often overlook the interests of the individual road user. In addition, the emphasis is on travel time savings and scarcely on the environmental impact of traffic. This research contributes to knowledge on the trade-offs between collective and individual interests (multi-level) and accessibility, and the environment (multi-objective). The objective is to integrate these trade-offs in new strategies for energy efficient network management and evaluate these strategies with the ecoAdaptive Balancing and Control application of the eCoMove project. This paper discusses findings from literature review and presents the design of a Ph.D. research.

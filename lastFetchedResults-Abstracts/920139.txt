Background & Objective: Despite numerous findings that aerobic exercise is positively associated with cognitive functions , the data in populations such as people with Down syndrome who suffer from memory impairment is little and limited to animal models .The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of aerobic exercise on short-term memory in individual with Down syndrome.
Material &Methods: The sample of 20 individual with Down's syndrome from Karaj Association were selected and divided into experimental and control groups randomly. Following the evaluation of memories by Wechsler memory test, 3month training period, 3 days a week was conducted for experimental group. Then evaluation of memories was performed again. Data were analyzed by using SPSS 16 software and ANOVA with repeated measures and   t-test. 
Results: there was no significant difference between mean scores of verbal and visual of control and experimental groups in the beginning (p=0.585,p=0.807,resprctively), but this difference after 3 month was significant (p < 0.001, for 2 types memory). Also there was no significant difference in mean scores of control group before and after intervention (p=0.63,p=0.094, respectively), but this difference in experimental group was significant (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: These findings emphasis on relationship between aerobic exercise and short-term memory, and using these types of exercise to enhance memory functions in individuals with Down syndrome are considered effective.

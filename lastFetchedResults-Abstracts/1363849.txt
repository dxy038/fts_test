The achievement of a sustainable practice of everyday urban life is directly linked to the urban landscape, beauty, and creative potential of its desirable spaces. Visual elements of urban landscape not only present aesthetical values but also verify the mutual relationships of these values in cultural, economic, and biological dimensions. Urban landscape is in an urban environment to meet the man-made environment on the natural environment in the material and spiritual aspects of the landscape needs. Urban landscape affects people's lives, psychological and rational arrangement of the public spaces to meet the people's needs, from the psychological and aesthetic demands of the city, to create the necessary environment. Urban landscape is a living system, that a complex assembly of flows, structures, connections, and owners form it. In order to have a safe, convenient, and beautiful urban environment we should fundamentally consider the aesthetics aspect of urban landscape. A desirable urban landscape would be accomplished when the shape, scale, and beauties of the buildings, which are participant in creation of this urban landscape, are being lauded. In addition, untimely changes in urban landscape and destruction of worthy of remarkable and memorable buildings should be prevented. In fact, a desirable urban landscape deserves something more than not only apartment complexes and non-built spaces, but also traditional and vernacular senses. The urban landscape could be called beautiful, when it gives the chance of living in an emotional, well ordered, peaceful, calm, and dreamful city to the people. When one passes through a city with beautiful urban landscape, his/her eyes will give him/her a satisfactory sight of buildings with their harmonic lines and pleasant outlooks. The beautiful urban landscape will not excite the fear, presentiment, and anxiety. It is mixed with natural theme and its well- configured ratio of natural spaces and buildings, provokes people to pass through city. The objective of this paper is to investigate the features and qualities of urban landscape, definition of aesthetics standards in urban landscape, categorizing the aesthetics theories of the urban landscape and eventually to introduce the elements and qualities of a beautiful urban landscape. The findings of this study show that the urban landscape is the perceptible or visible aspect of the environment, which has its own form, function, meaning, and particularly beauty.

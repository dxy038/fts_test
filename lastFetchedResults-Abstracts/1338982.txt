An 8-year-old Hungarian warmblood gelding used for show jumping was evaluated because of poor performance and chronic weight loss. On admission, oral and gastroesophageal ulcerations and malabsorption were detected. Results of thoracic radiography, ultrasonography, bronchoalveolar lavage cytology, and positive polymerase chain reaction for equine herpesvirus 5 raised the possible diagnosis of equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis. However, abdominal ultrasonography revealed inhomogeneous spleen with many different sized well-demarcated hypoechoic areas, which suggested further differential diagnoses such as tuberculosis, neoplasias, immune mediated diseases, systemic granulomatous disease (SGD), or toxicoses. The horse was euthanized at the owner's request because of the poor condition and possible grave prognosis. Histopathology findings were characteristic of SGD, which is a rare disorder of horses characterized by skin lesions, weight loss, and granulomatous inflammation of multiple organ systems. The lack of skin lesions in this case is an unusual finding. Systemic granulomatous disease is hypothesized to be induced by multiple conventional antigens that are not cleared from affected tissues. Equine herpesvirus 5 might have triggered the granulomatous reactions in this particular case.

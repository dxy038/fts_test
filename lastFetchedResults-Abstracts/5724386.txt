This paper presents a small and lightweight tactile display system and describes its capabilities with respect to spatial and temporal tactile feedback. Each tactile display module is comprised of a 4times4 piezoelectric ultrasonic actuator array with a spatial resolution of 1.5 mm and a temporal resolution of 20 Hz. The objective of this research is to build a small and lightweight tactile display system such that the system, including the display modules and complete controller parts, will be wearable by a user. It was found that the developed tactile display module can display both spatial and temporal information with less power consumption.

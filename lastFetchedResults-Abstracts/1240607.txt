The objective of this work is to test a model-guided approach, coupled with an efficient material synthesis method, for the development of new thermoluminescent (TL) material using yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG, Y3Al5O12) as a model material. We systematically investigated undoped and lanthanide-doped YAG using x-ray diffraction (XRD), TL, and radioluminescence (RL) to understand the role of the lanthanides in the TL process, i.e., whether they act as trapping centers or recombination centers. We also prepared samples with multiple dopants to test the possibility of creating materials with multiple TL peaks. The initial rise method of TL analysis was used to estimate the activation energies associated with the TL peaks.

The RLCM parameters of the ladder network detailed model of a transformer winding are obtained using a new estimation method based on frequency response measurements on transformer terminals. The estimation problem is reformulated from electromagnetic formulations used in the model evaluation algorithm. A multi-objective global search for solutions is performed by means of a genetic algorithm in a space of reduced and fixed dimension. The coupling characteristic is intrinsic to the model, thereby avoiding inductive inequality constraints. The proposed method is characterized by its simplicity, high physical cohesion, good conditioning and computational efficiency.

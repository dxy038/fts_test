People who struggle financially are often some of the most discriminating consumers; value for money takes on more urgency when resources are limited. This scarcity also leads to innovative solutions to everyday problems which can be leveraged by supporting them through use of ICT to create sustainable services/products. This research paper is set within the background of management of natural resources and their related environments in Rural India. It proposes a framework to support the emergence of a Knowledge Infrastructure that allows for creation of localized products/services. The infrastructure would model and document processes mapping the bricoleur approach to resource management prevalent in India to structured grids of information. With this objective, we provide for knowledge to be managed in ways that enable the benefits from bottom-up, and allow for geographically dispersed, incrementalist teams. The paper makes an attempt to look at existing structures, open-source methodologies and organizations that support rural innovation. It comments on how these can be leveraged using an experience management framework to create more opportunities for innovation. The central lessons is that the mutual dependencies between different layers in the distributed team of the Enterprise involving farmers, technical experts, management, etc. enable continuous innovation in methods involved in any process. In conclusion, the paper objectifies the context of these innovations and attempts to emphasize the need for effective translation of methods from bricoleur tacit knowledge to a documented method for innovation

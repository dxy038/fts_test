Tissue engineered constructs have the potential to be used as replacements for current bone graft technologies. One component necessary for bone tissue engineering is a readily available, osteogenic cell source. Human dermal fibroblasts may have the potential to differentiate along an osteoblastic lineage, making them a candidate for use in bone tissue engineering applications. The objective of this study was to validate the ability of dermal fibroblasts to express gene and protein markers of osteoblastic differentiation and to explore their potential, in combination with biomaterial scaffolds and signaling factors, for use in bone tissue engineering

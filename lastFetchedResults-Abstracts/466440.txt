Objective: Our aim was to compare outcomes in women with a questionable history of incompetent cervix, followed up with early transvaginal ultrasonography, with outcomes in women who had early cerclage. Study Design: Charts were reviewed and patients identified for incompetent cervix from our obstetric database from 1995 through 1997. We included women who had an unclear history of incompetent cervix as follows: second-trimester loss or termination, â‰¥3 first-trimester terminations, cone biopsy or loop electrosurgical excision, or exposure to diethylstilbestrol. The primary outcome variable was gestational age at delivery. Results: A total of 106 women were included, 45 in the early cerclage group and 61 in the early transvaginal ultrasonography group. The mean gestational age at delivery was 35.1 weeks for the early cerclage group versus 36.1 weeks for the early transvaginal ultrasonography group. Conclusion: In women with an unclear history of incompetent cervix, early cerclage does not appear to offer significant benefit over early transvaginal ultrasonography.

Objective
To assess the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features differentiating tuberculous spondylitis from pyogenic spondylitis.
Methods
MR imaging findings in 10 patients with tuberculous spondylitis were retrospectively compared with those of 13 patients with pyogenic spondylitis.
Results
There were significant differences in imaging criteria (paraspinal abnormal signal, paraspinal or intraspinal abscess, thoracic spine involvement, and abnormal signal around the facet joint).
Conclusions
MR imaging is a very useful technique for differentiation of tuberculous spondylitis from pyogenic spondylitis.

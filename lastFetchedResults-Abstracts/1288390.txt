A series of 4-quinolylhydrazones was synthesized and tested in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. At a concentration of 6.25 Î¼g/mL, most of the newly synthesized compounds displayed 100% inhibitory activity against M. tuberculosis in cellular assays. Further screening allowed the identification of very potent antitubercular agents. Compound 4c was also tested in a time-course experiment and against mtb clinical isolates, displaying interesting results.

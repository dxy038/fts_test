It is important for business organizations to be adaptive so that they are able to withstand the changes in the environment like sudden increase in the task arrival rate. Flexible assignment of the number of resources to organizations is necessary for adaptation. In this paper, a technique based on Organization Self-Design (OSD) is used to achieve this objective. The basic aim is to cater to the real-time requirements. Agents controlling different resource types allocate or release instances of the resource types depending on the load on the resources. With the increase in the number of resources, tasks could be allocated to the new resource instances. This increase in the parallelism allows the system to cater to the increase in the demand. The resource instances are released with the decrease in the demand for cost-effective problem solving. Extensive simulation studies have been performed to understand the dynamics of the system. It has been demonstrated empirically that the OSD technique works well for adaptive problem solving.

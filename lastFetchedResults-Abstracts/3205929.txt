The objective of the work is to propose a dynamic authentication system for consumer supplies using Quick Response (QR) code in a Mobile Cloud Computing environment. In recent years, extensive research has been carried out on vision-based automatic identification technology that recognizes image codes using smart phones to provide various services that can recognize the authenticity of any product. Standard image codes like one-dimensional barcodes and two-dimensional codes with black and white patterns identifies a product for its value and basic features but does not authenticate it, moreover not every product that is identified, is used for authenticating manufacturer´s warranty. So a novel method of using QR code verifies products by capturing it through the smart phone, then decodes and sends it to the cloud for authentication. The web server forwards the message to product manufacturer´s data center and the response received from the cloud enables the consumer to decide based on the products authenticity. The proposed software architecture uses the Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI) to provide Software as a Services (SaaS) model deployed in a public cloud set up of Google App Engine.

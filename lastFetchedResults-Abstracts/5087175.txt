A new cross layer path selection scheme with quality of service (QoS) support along urban areas is proposed. First, we introduce a cross-layer approach where the routing decision takes explicit consideration of the application layer objective function. Second, the queueing based mobility model, spatial traffic distribution and probability of connectivity for sparse and dense Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) are taken into consideration for developing the cross-layer routing protocol. We focus on the video streaming application and optimize application layer performance metric, i.e., Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). Video stream is downloaded from a Road Side Unit (RSU) deployed along the road and is transmitted to the destination vehicle via multi-hop communication. Simulation results show that the cross layer path selection scheme can achieve results close to the upper analytical bound.

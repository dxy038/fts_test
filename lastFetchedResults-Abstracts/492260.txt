Understanding the soil quality indices on different landscape position and use appropriates indices would result in a better land management in such areas. The main objective of the current study was to assess some indicators of soil quality in almond orchards in Saman region, Shahrekord. The experiment consisting of a split-plot design arranged in a randomized complete block with three replicates. Tree parallel transects (as block), each 10 meter away from each other were selected in two slope aspects (North and South as main-plots). Soil samples were taken from the top 30 cm in four slope positions from summit to toe slope position (as subplots) under Almond tree (canopy spaces) and in open spaces with an interval of 10 meters. Soil texture, bulk density, electrical conductivity and the concentrations of total organic carbon, total N, microbial respiration, alkaline and acid phosphates activities and N mineralization were measured. The results indicated that the lower slope positions including foot slope and toe slope had the highest amounts of clay, organic C, total N, EC, alkaline and acid phosphates activities, N mineralization and C mineralization rates. The amounts of total organic C and N mineralization rates reflect the differences between the two slope aspects. The highest amount of, clay and C mineralization observed in the toe slopes of north aspect. In addition, both aspects and sampling locations had significant interaction effects on all soil quality indicators. Therefore, most soil properties are depended largely on landscape position that could have a long-term influence on soil development and evolution. Among the measured soil properties, the amounts of organic carbon, microbial respiration and phosphates activity are more suitable indicators for assessing the effects of landscape position on soil quality in the studied area.

Objective
The immunomodulatory effect of deer antler, which is used as traditional medicine, has been known, but the active component of antlers from Cervus elaphus has not been identified. In this study, we identified the immunomodulator from C. elaphus and examined its biological activities on the immune system.
Methods

To identify an immunomodulator, we used bioassay-guided fractionation after silica gel column chromatography. Structural analysis was performed with one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance techniques and tandem mass spectrometry coupled with fast atom bombardment.
Results

The subfraction, phosphatidylcholines, isolated 70% ethanol extract of C. elaphus induced the proliferation of spleen cells in synergy with concanavalin A. According to the structural analysis, phosphatidylcholines were classified as a family (1,2-alkyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholines) containing arachidonyl (C20:4), stearoyl (C18:0), oleoyl (C18:1), linoleoyl (C18:2), palmitoyl (C16:0), and myristoyl (C14:0) chains in their fatty acyl chains. Because the unsaturated fatty acids showed an inhibitory effect on the immune system, dialkyl phosphatidylcholines with different chain lengths from C10:0 to C20:0 that stimulate the proliferation of spleen cells were examined extensively. Among other saturated phosphatidylcholines used, dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (C14:0) induced the proliferation of spleen cells more efficiently, whereas dimyristoleoyl phosphatidylcholine (C14:1) effected little change in the proliferation of spleen cells.
Conclusions

These data collectively suggest that phosphatidylcholines with saturated fatty acyl chains are immunostimulating factors. They may modify the proliferation of known mitogens. Further, chain length and saturation of the fatty acids may play important roles in the proliferation of spleen cells.

The mobile user objective system (MUOS) is a geo-satellite communications system derived from the terrestrial cellular WCDMA air interface. WCDMA power control with the long geo-satellite round trip time presents substantial challenges. This paper describes the Point-to-Point power control system with simulation results using time-varying channel models specified by the MUOS program office.

Introduction & Objective: Magnesium is a NMDA receptor antagonist and a calcium channel blocker. The aim of the study is to evaluate the analgesic efficiency of preoperative magne-sium sulfate infusion in patients undergoing elective cesarean surgery. 
Materials & Methods: In a randomized double blind trial study approved by local ethics com-mittee, 68 parturient who were admitted for elective cesarean section through spinal anesthe-sia were divided into two equal groups. Magnesium group (M) received IV magnesium sul-fate 50 mg/kg as a bolus and then 10 mg/kg/h IV as continuous infusion at the time of sur-gery. The control group (S) received the same amount of isotonic saline. Both groups were completely monitored  and  the data about blood pressure, heart rate ,side effects and severity of pain (VAS) was recorded for 24  hours in  the obstetric ward.  The patients who had VAS = 4–6 received supp. Diclofenac Na (100 mg) and the patients who had VAS=7–10 received Diclofenac Na (75 mg) by intramuscular injection. The rate of diclofenac Na consumption was recorded for each patient.
Results: The pain scores in  the magnesium group  were significantly lower than the control group at 2 and 24 hours post operatively(P < 0.05). Diclofenac dose consumption was also significantly lower in the magnesium group  (137 ± 54 rather than 231± 67) and (P < 0.005). 
Conclusion: IV magnesium sulfate administration during cesarean section in  the parturients  anesthetized intrathecally, decreases analgesic consumption after surgery and improves post-operative analgesia.

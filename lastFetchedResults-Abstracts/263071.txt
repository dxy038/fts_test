Experimental results in button cells show that a porous chemically inert barrier layer can extend the range of coke-free operation on Niâ€“YSZ anode structures, even with pure methane as the fuel. The first objective of this paper is to assist interpreting these results using computational models that consider porous-media transport and heterogeneous reforming chemistry. The second objective is to predict the performance of a chemically inert barrier layer in a tubular, anode-supported, solid-oxide fuel cell.

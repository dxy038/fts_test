We develop a new automated pattern recognition system for interpretation of heart sounds based on wavelet decomposition of signals and classification using neural network. Inputs to the system are the heart sound signals acquired by a stethoscope in a noiseless environment. We generate features for the objective concise representation of heart sound signals by means of wavelet decomposition. Classification of the features is performed using a back propagation neural network with adaptive learning rate. Two hundred record windows obtained from young humans are studied. One hundred of the record windows in the database are selected for use as a training phase for the neural network. The test results of the intelligent pattern recognition system for ten different types of heart sound signals displayed a high success.

The main objective of future wireless mobile multimedia networks is to provide services efficiently to the mobile users in allenvironments. In wireless mobile Communication the channel allocation and bandwidth sharing are the major factors and quality of service isthe important issue to decide the system performance. In this work a Hybrid Channel Allocation(HCA)strategy for channel allocation and anovel bandwidth sharing technique applied to Hybrid Channel Allocation strategy for Quality of Service(QoS) provisioning are implemented. The proposed HCA strategy considers new calls in Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) method and handoff calls in Dynamic Channel Allocation (DCA) method. In the bandwidth sharing of mobile multimedia calls, a multimedia call is considered as a combination of three classes namelyvoice of CBR, Voice with low rate video of CBR and Voice with high rate video of VBR. Priority of the above classes and a new bandwidthsharing method is implemented. When the required bandwidth is not available for a handoff (HO) call, it rejects a low Priority class andpostpones bandwidth sharing to the class, that may cause delay, but it is not a major problem for the Quality of Service (QoS). Our methoddecreases the handoff call dropping probability (CDP) when compared with Without Control method (WCM). It also improves thecommunication quality of handoff calls in mobile multimedia networks

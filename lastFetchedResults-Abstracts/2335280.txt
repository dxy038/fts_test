Introduction: Tuberculous or tubercular liver abscess (TLA) is  a  rare  manifestation  of  extrapulmonary  tuberculosis (TB) and  it  should be  considered  in  the  differential  diagnosis  of  mass  or  cystic  lesions  of  the  liver especially in a high TB prevalence country like Iran. 
Case Presentation: We report an immunocompetent 48 year-old woman with TLA and peritoneal infection.
Although hepatic TLA is very  rare,  it  should  be  considered  in  the  differential  diagnosis  of  mass  or  cystic  lesions  of  the  liver  especially  in  a  high  TB  prevalence country.

Objective
The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of oligohydramnios in term pregnancies during the Paris heat wave of 2003 (August 4-14).
Study design
A comparison of this frequency to a historical control group examined during the same period in 2002.
Results
The frequency of oligohydramnios in normal term pregnancies was 17.5% during the heat wave that affected Paris in August 2003.
Conclusion
This frequency was substantially higher than the rate of oligohydramnios in normal term pregnancies in August 2002 (4.4%).

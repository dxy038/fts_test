The objective of this study was to determine effects of pre rigor stretching on beef tenderness development. Beef loins (M. longissimus dorsi; n = 24) were assigned to either stretching or non-stretching treatments and aged for 14 days at − 1.5 °C. Sarcomere length, shear force, water-holding capacity and proteolysis were determined for the loins at 1, 7 and 14 days of ageing. Stretching increased the length of the loins by 33% resulting in a trend of increasing sarcomere length (P = 0.19). However, no significant differences for shear force values, purge, drip and cooking losses between treatments were found. Shear force values decreased with ageing times (P &lt; 0.05). Western blot assay found that stretching did not affect the extent of desmin degradation. The findings from the present study suggest that pre rigor stretching with the current increase in length will not contribute to tenderness improvement of the beef loins.

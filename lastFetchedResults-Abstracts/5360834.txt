The objective of this work is to model driver behaviour in the area of route selection. The research focuses on an optimum route search function in a typical in-car navigation system or dynamic route guidance system. In this work, the authors emphasize the need to orientate the route selection method on the driver´s preference. Each route candidate has a set of attributes. A fuzzy-neural approach is used to represent the correlation of the attributes with the driver´s route selection. A recommendation or route ranking can be provided to the driver. Based on a training of the fuzzy-neural net on the driver´s choice, the route selection function can be made adaptive to the decision-making of the driver

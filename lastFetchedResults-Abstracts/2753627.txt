This paper presents an integrated control scheme for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operation in the distribution grid with renewable energy sources. A hierarchical framework is proposed for V2G applications, and the mathematical models are built for both smart charging and V2G operation with distribution grid constraints. V2G power is regulated to minimize the total operating cost (TOC) while providing frequency regulation. The simulation results verify the control algorithm in coordinating distributed electric vehicle (EV) aggregations with the varying wind power and daily load. For V2G dynamic regulation, EVs connected in close proximity to wind power generators can locally compensate for the wind fluctuation with fast response and, hence, smooth out the power fluctuation at the bus having wind power generators and EVs. Each individual EV is strategically assigned to implement the simulated control algorithm through a bidirectional converter. An experimental platform is incorporated into the proposed integrated energy management to demonstrate the instantaneous response of EV battery storage.

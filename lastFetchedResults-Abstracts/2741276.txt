High quality speech at low bit rates makes code excited linear prediction (CELP) the dominant choice for a narrowband coding technique despite the susceptibility to packet loss. One of the few techniques which received attention after the introduction of CELP coding technique is the internet low bitrate codec (iLBC) because of inherent high robustness to packet loss. Addition of rate flexibility and scalability makes the iLBC an attractive choice for voice communication over IP networks. In this paper, performance improvement schemes of multi-rate iLBC and its scalable structure are proposed, and the proposed codec enhanced from the previous work is re-designed based on the subjective listening quality instead of the objective quality. In particular, perceptual weighting and the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) with short overlap in weighted signal domain are employed along with the improved packet loss concealment (PLC) algorithm. The subjective evaluation results show that the speech quality of the proposed codec is equivalent to that of state-of-the-art codec, G.718, under both a clean channel condition and lossy channel conditions. This result is significant considering that development of the proposed codec is still in early stage.

Objective The mortality of psychiatric
patients is higher than that of the general population.
Earlier studies have typically focused on specific
diagnostic categories or causes of death. The aim of
this study was to assess the overall mortality in acute
psychiatric hospital patients covering all diagnostic
groups, with special emphasis on substance abuse.
Methods The sample consisted of all 18â€“64-year old
patients (n = 3,835) treated or evaluated in the acute
wards of the Department of Psychiatry at Tampere
University Hospital between the years 1999 and 2003,
who were followed-up until the end of the year 2005.
We assessed the various causes of death according to
background variables in bivariate and multivariate
analyses and calculated the standardized mortality
ratios (SMRs). Results During the study period 379
subjects died (9.9% of the sample). Mortality among
men was almost twice as high as among women. Of all
deaths, 45.6% were considered to be alcohol or drug
related. SMR covering all subjects was 6.55. The SMRs
for unnatural causes were higher than those for natural
causes. The highest SMRs for unnatural causes of
death were found in patients with mood disorders
and the highest SMRs for natural causes of death in
patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Use
of coercive measures was associated with increased
mortality. Conclusion Mortality among Finnish psychiatric
acute hospital patients is considerably higher
than in general population. Excessive alcohol consumption
plays a major role in causing excess deaths
that could be potentially avoided

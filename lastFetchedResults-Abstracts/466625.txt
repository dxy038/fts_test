Objective: To document the occurrence of long-term sequelae after type I female genital mutilation (FGM) and describe the surgical treatment of epidermal clitoral inclusion cyst. Study Design: Twenty-one women presented with epidermal clitoral inclusion cyst after type I FGM at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at King Fahad Armed Forces Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The duration (mean ± SD, range) of symptoms was 10.3 ± 5.4, 2 to 20 years. They were treated by excision of the cyst with particular attention to preserve the remaining part of the clitoris. The technique involves making a vertical incision in the skin, dissecting and excising the cyst, removing the excessive skin, and reapproximating the skin edges. Results: The procedure was done on all patients without intraoperative complications. All except one were discharged home on the second postoperative day. Follow-up showed no recurrence of symptoms. Conclusion: Long-term sequelae can occur after type I FGM. The surgical treatment of clitoral inclusion cyst is simple and effective. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:569-71.)

Potassium (K) is one of the major essential elements for plants nutrition. The objective of this study was to determine the origin of extractable K in soils of the Mesaoria plain. The study was conducted in 6 widely distributed soil series of the Mesaoria plain, which covers 1/3rd of the cultivated lands. Results showed that exchangeable K levels in soils are above 150 mg kg-1, which was mainly, due to the presence of illite, even in low amounts, mineral in all studied series. Exchangeable and non-exchangeable K fractions were positively correlated. Results suggested that at present available K in the soils is not limiting for common crops in N. Mesaoria plain however, at soils close to insufficient levels, cropping K-demanding crops such as maize may cause K deficiencies. Â© 2010 Friends Science Publishers

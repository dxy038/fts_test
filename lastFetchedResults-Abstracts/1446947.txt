The objective of this study was to compare the carcass and meat quality of pigs of two sire lines (A vs B) reared in either a spacious or crowded environment. A total of 128 pigs (barrows and gilts) were used in the study. Animals were slaughtered at 120 kg live weight. Dressing percentage was greater for line A in the spacious but not the crowded environment and line A had a greater loin eye area than line B. Compared to line B, the longissimus from line A had lower pH, higher L* and b* values, and was judged to be paler and softer with a lower marbling fat content. Longissimus L* values were lower for pigs reared in the crowded compared to the spacious environment. Longissimus drip loss was greater for line A compared to line B in the spacious but not the crowded environment. This study highlights genetic differences in pork quality and suggests rearing environment effects that warrant further study.

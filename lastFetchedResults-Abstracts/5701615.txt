Experimental system identification and position control results are presented for third- and fourth-order systems based on a DC motor with higher-order dynamics. The objective was to obtain high closed-loop bandwidths by implementing a pole-zero placement controlled designed using the experimentally identified systems models. The system identification and control were implemented digitally using recently introduced delta operator formulations. It was found that high-performance control could be obtained and that the systems could effectively perform for different system parameter values when accurate identification models were used for the controller design. The effect of filtering on the least squares results was found to be significant

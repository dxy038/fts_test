This book is truly the first scholarly study of Tesla that is not only objective but also provides extensive references and endnotes to support and document the narrative. There are a whopping forty-nine pages of references and endnotes, a rich list of archival collections, and a list of major sources of information ?? not the least of which is The Tesla Collection, originally a 23-volume collection of full-text articles by and about Tesla appearing in periodicals and newspapers between 1896 and 1920. These difficult-to-find articles are catalogued by publication, author, year subject and title ?? and the best part is they can be accessed from the Internet at www.teslacollection.com/.

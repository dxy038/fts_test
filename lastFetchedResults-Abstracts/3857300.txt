A dynamic and practical method for teaching power system protection engineering is presented. The method is based on creating an undergraduate course that simulates actual work of a protection engineer at a utility company. Course assignments are obtained from a set of actual cases that had to be handled at various utility companies. The objective is to reduce or even eliminate the training period for the new engineers when they start to work in this area. The course is popular among graduating seniors and local utility engineers

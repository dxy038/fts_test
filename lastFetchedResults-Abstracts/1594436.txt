The Battle Enhanced Analysis Methodologies (BEAM) project was designed to investigate the use of computer graphics in describing the performance of battalion-sized units in simulated combat. These descriptions were to be data-based and objective, providing useful critiques of actual performance according to standard Army doctrine. They would be natural candidates for use at the Army's Combat Training Centers.

oject was conducted in two phases. In the first, objective graphic displays were derived which portray the destructive potential of direct fire weapons (the shooter must be able to see the target) in the defense. These displays allow straightforward objective comparisons of different defensive alignments and, from simulated battle runs, of defensive fire control strategies. These references also describe simple uncluttered displays that portray the movements and interactions of company (or higher) sized units throughout a battle.

aper describes results of the second phase of the BEAM project. A major result is the derivation of displays which portray the destructive potential of indirect fire weapons (the shooter normally cannot see the target) in the defense using the same units as the direct fire displays. This allows separate and joint examination of the direct and indirect fire destructive potential, providing, among other things, objective measures of the synchronization and agility of a force, as well as indicators of its intelligence function.

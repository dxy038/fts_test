Topological configuration of the physical links of a network (network structure) is an important problem of mobile communication network planning because it will determine the long-term performance and service quality of networks. In this paper, the architecture aspects of radio access network (RAN) physical links configuration for the fourth generation (4G) of wireless networks are considered. In the 4G systems ring structures of a RAN configuration may be applied in contrast to RANs of current wireless systems. Therefore, the objective of our research is to estimate the RAN ring structure from the viewpoint of cost and reliability parameters and compare the obtained parameters with those of other structures. As a result of this study, we are able to give recommendations on using different configurations of physical links in the RAN for mobile communication systems beyond IMT-2000 (4G systems).

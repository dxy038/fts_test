Image Retrieval system is an effective and efficient tool for managing large image databases. A content based image retrieval system allows the user to present a query image in order to retrieve images stored in the database according to their similarity to the query image. In this paper content based image retrieval method is used as diagnosis aid in medical fields. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the retrieval system based on Texture features. The texture features are extracted by using pyramidal wavelet transform. The major advantage of such an approach is that little human intervention is required. The method is evaluated on Diabetic Retinopathy Database (DRD). Here the precision rate obtained is about 60% for DRD images.

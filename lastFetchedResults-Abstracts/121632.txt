Background & Aim: Patients' satisfaction is one of the most important indices for evaluating quality of care. Restricting patients to be bed rest after angiography leads to minimize the complications bleeding which is always accompanied by patient's fatigue and dissatisfaction. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of changing patients' position on the levels of fatigue and satisfaction and to monitor the amount of bleeding and hematoma after angiography.
Material & Method: This study was a quasi-experimental design with accessible sampling on Iranian patients (with 18-80 years old) who had undergone non-emergency angiography, were randomly allocated to experimental or control group (35 patients in each group). A demographic questionnaire, visual analog scale to measure the fatigue intensity and the level of satisfaction, and a specific ruler to measure the amount of bleeding and hematoma were used to collect data. The experimental group was treated with the modified positioning compared to the control group with routine protocol.
Results: To analyze the data, t-test, chi square, ANOVA with repeated measure and correlation tests were used. The study finding showed that the control group had significantly higher fatigue scores, and lower satisfaction scores than the experimental group at 3, 6, 8 hours and on the next morning after angiography (P<0.05). There also was no significant difference in the amount of bleeding and hematoma in the experimental group compared to the control group (P>0.05).
Conclusion: According to the study results, modifying positioning of the patients after angiography is associated with decreased level of fatigue and increased satisfaction level without increasing the risk of bleeding and hematoma.

Consumption of nonrenewable resource, weighted coefficient and the duration are combined, and objective function is constructed dynamically by choosing different weights. In this way, the optimal solution of scheduling mode can be gained which meets different needs of projects. It has been proved that by adopting the algorithm, not only duration can be the shortest, but also nonrenewable resources can be saved maximum, which will be great significance to achieve the optimal arrangement of time and resources in practical production.

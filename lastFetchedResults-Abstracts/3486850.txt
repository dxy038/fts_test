We present the results of structural lightning protective system (LPS) tests conducted in 2004 and 2005 at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) at Camp Blanding, FL. Lightning was triggered using the rocket-and- wire technique, and its current was directly injected into the LPS. The test configurations in 2004 and 2005 differed in the lightning current injection point, number of down conductors, grounding system at the test house, and the use of surge protective devices. The primary objective was to examine the division of the injected lightning current between the grounding system of the test house, and remote ground accessible via the neutral of the power-supply cable. In 2004, the mean value of the peak current entering the electrical circuit neutral in search of its way to remote ground was about 22% of the injected lightning current peak, while in 2005, it was about 59%. For comparison, more than 80% of the injected peak current was observed to enter the electrical circuit neutral in similar 1997 tests at the ICLRT in which a different test house with a different (poorer) grounding system was used (Rakov et al. 2002 [1]). An attempt to model the 2004 and 2005 experiments is presented in a companion paper.

Summary form only given. In almost all current network management systems, a relational database or an object oriented database has been utilized for implementing the management information base (MIB). By using such conventional databases, network management systems can benefit from efficient query processing and reliable transaction processing. However, these features are not sufficient for managing evolving telecommunication networks and services. In order to deal with this problem and to sustain the timely user response and the quality of network services under any circumstances, it is important for the conventional MIB to add real-time capabilities that take into account the priority of each management operation. A real-time database system (RTDBS) is a database system that has real-time capabilities. The main objective of the RTDBS is to complete transactions before their deadlines expire. In order to study a new MIB implementation, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the RTDBS. The RTDBS contains a variety of modules, such as transaction scheduling, concurrency control, and buffer management. Among these, we focus on transaction scheduling by using a memory based RTDBS. In our evaluation, we consider an ATM transmission network that consists of 7 network elements, and 28 physical links

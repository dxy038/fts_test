This paper presents a real-time system of distributed video coding (DVC). DVC is a current video compression paradigm. The decoding process of DVC is normally complex, which causes difficulty in real-time implementation. To address this problem, we propose a new configuration of DVC with three methods: simple rate control without the feedback channel, simple transmitting of dynamic range and simple bidirectional motion estimation to reduce complexity. Then we implement the system with parallelization techniques. We also develop the encoder for a low power processor. Experimental results show that the encoder on i.MX31 400 MHz could operates at about CIF 13 fps, and the decoder on Core 2 Quad 2.83 GHz operates at more than CIF 30 fps.

Abstract
Background and Objectives: L- asparaginase is an anti-neoblastic agent used in the chemotherapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This enzyme is widely distributed among microorganisms and animals. Microorganisms have proved to be a better alternative for L- asparaginase. The 
objective of this study was isolation and molecular identification of L- asparaginase producing bacteria from Persian Gulf.
Material and Methods: In this study, samples were collected both water and sediments of Persian Gulf. An screening culture was performed on M9 in order to isolate the L- asparaginase 
producing bacteria. Next, after preparation of bacterial cell free suspension, the L- asparaginase activity was measured by Colorimertic method. Among producing L- asparaginase strains 13 
isolates with high L-asparaginase activity were selected and their phylogeny were detected based on nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene.
Results: Totally, 57 isolates out of 181 achieved bacterial colonies were able to produce 
L- asparaginase. Based on 16SrRNA analysis, these 13 chosen isolates with high L-asparaginase producing ability belonged to Bacillus spp. (8 isolate, 61.5%), Pseudomonas spp. (2 isolate, 15.4%), Zobellella spp. (1 isolate, 7.7%), Oceanimonas spp. (1 isolate, 7.7%) and Acinetobacter (1 isolate, 7.7%). The highest and lowest L- asparaginase productivity was measured in  
Pseudomonas sp. PG-01 with 1.6 IU and Acinetobacter sp. PG-14 with 0.07 IU, respectively. 
Conclusion: Some marine bacterial strains isolated from Persian Gulf are potential source of 
L- asparaginase enzyme. Pseudomonas sp. PG-01 is especially useful for commercial production of this enzyme. In this study, the ability of Zobellella spp. for production of L- asparaginase is reported for first time.

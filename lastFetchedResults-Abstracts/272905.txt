The objective of the present paper is to demonstrate the effect of large deformations on the piezoelectric materials
and structures. An energy based electromechanical piezoelectric constitutive law derived by Tiersten is adopted. For
large deformation analysis of beams a counterpart of Von Karman’s plate equation is considered. The displacement
fields in finite element method are based on the first order shear deformation theory. To analyze the nonlinear equilibrium
equations an incremental iterative technique based on the Newton–Raphson method is employed. In the
present algorithm the equilibrium is examined considering the electromechanical coupling effects. Nonlinear effects due
to transverse and axial loading on a cantilever and a pinned–pinned PVDF bimorph beam have been investigated

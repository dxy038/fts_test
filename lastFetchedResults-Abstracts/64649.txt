Eight cases of feline (muco)cutaneous mycobacteriosis were studied to identify the causative agent and examine for phenotype and functional characteristics (expression of interleukin (IL)-1BETA, IL-6, IL-12, tumour necrosis factor-ALPHA and inducible nitric oxide synthase) of the inflammatory cells. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing identified the causative agents as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. avium complex in each four cases. Lesions were characterised by pyogranulomatous infiltration, with variability in the presence and size of necrotic areas, the presence of multinucleated giant cells and the degree of lymphocyte infiltration. Macrophages were positive for myeloid/histiocyte antigen (calprotectin), suggesting they represented freshly recruited monocytes; further differentiation to epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells was associated with loss of the myeloid/histiocyte antigen. Lymphocytes were found disseminated in the infiltrate (predominantly T cells) and as B cell-dominated accumulations mainly in the periphery of the lesions. Acid-fast bacilli were numerous. In M. tuberculosis complex infection, extracellular bacilli were most prominent, whereas in M. avium complex infection, bacilli were mainly located intracellularly. All cytokines examined as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were variably expressed by macrophages, epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells. Expression was most intense in degenerating macrophages loaded with intracellular bacilli, but was also seen cell-free within necrotic areas. The intense induction of cytokine and iNOS expression especially in infected macrophages suggests a relatively low virulence for these infectious agents in cats. Furthermore, the confinement of the bacilli to lesions indicates a successful response to infection.

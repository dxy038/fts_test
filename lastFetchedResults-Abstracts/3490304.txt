When constructing a propagation channel model, a substitute is often created by giving an arbitrary shape or form to scatterer distributions based on its intuitive appeal for a certain radio environment. However, such models do not necessarily represent the actual propagation process and may yield inaccurate results. The main objective of this paper is to provide an insight into the underlying relationship between geometric models and the particular physical propagation process they represent. The workhorse is the semi-geometrically based statistical (SGBS) model and the two heuristic rules. The SGBS model defines the distribution of dominant scatterers contributing to the last reradiation of multipath components to the base station. The earlier multiple-reflection process is modeled using the composite Nakagami/log-normal probability density function. Two parameters are then introduced; namely, the effective path length and the normalized space-dependent intensity measure. Using these two metrics, two heuristic rules are subsequently proposed to provide the missing link between the canonical models and the physical channel. The rules are then applied to revisit several widely used geometric models in macro- and microcellular environments. As a working example, the Gaussian scatterer density model is further extended using such an approach. Important channel parameters such as power azimuthal spectrum, power delay spectrum, and azimuthal and delay spreads are then calculated and compared with simulation results.

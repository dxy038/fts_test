Research on usage of Learning Management Systems (LMS) in higher education has shown the particular benefits that can arise by LMS usage via personal laptop. The objective of the present study is to devise a method to investigate the extent to which these benefits are also valid in primary education and particularly so for Science and Technology education in the primary school. The aim is to test the educational usability of a specially designed and constructed platform based on Moodle, conceived with young (10-12 year old) children in mind, with the view that as Moodle is open-source, the new platform will be adopted by primary schools. All three LMS measurable quality-factors are targeted for educational evaluation: ease of navigation, speed and interactivity, and studentsÂ´ achievements when using the Learning Management System. The educational testing procedure is analysed herein.

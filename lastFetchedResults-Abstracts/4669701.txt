In this paper, we examine procedural and managerial gaps between air traffic control (ATC) and airline operations, and propose some solutions to address the problems. We suggest that accountability can drive many improvements, including better departure information, that will benefit customers, air traffic managers, and the airlines themselves. As new air traffic management methodologies are developed, it is critical to include better airline information to prevent the more costly economic consequences arising from inefficient national airspace system (NAS) operations. Keys to facilitating a better airline and FAA information are more accurate measures of both airline and FAA delay performance. We also suggest ways to prioritize flights entering the NAS based on objective operational and economic standards.

Small scale grid connected photovoltaics (PV) have rapidly increased in Australia over the past decade. This rapid increase has heightened supply utility concerns about the impact of these systems on customer power quality. The objective of this paper is to provide electricity supply utilities with information on how PV systems affect the network and ways to minimise the negative impacts. Analysis of physical data from case study areas has indicated that current penetration levels are too low to cause significant power quality issues, however power factor and current harmonic issues have been identified. Modeled increases in PV penetration are shown to cause voltage rise and current swing issues. Management strategies suggested are a monitoring program, energy storage, limitation of PV penetration on distribution transformers, and implementation of network infrastructure. Through effective management PV risk is reduced and benefits are fully utilised.

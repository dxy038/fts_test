Cooperative coevolution has been shown to be useful in evolutionary multiobjective optimization for bi- objective problems. However, this approach has yet to be investigated for multi-objective problems with higher dimensionality. In this paper, our objective is to conduct comprehensive empirical tests for cooperative coevolution using an evolutionary multiobjective algorithm for 3-dimensional problems. A new algorithm which integrates cooperative coevolutionary (CC) and the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) is proposed to achieve this objective. The resulting algorithm is referred to as the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 with cooperative coevolution (SPEA2-CC). The performance between SPEA2- CC is compared against SPEA2 in solving tri-objectives problems in DTLZ suite of test problems. The results showed that SPEA2-CC clearly outperforms SPEA2, further proving the validity and effectiveness of augmenting evolutionary multi-objective algorithms with the cooperative coevolution approach.

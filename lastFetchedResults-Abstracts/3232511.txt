In Brazil, the resolution No. 303/2002 of the National Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL) joined the guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) for limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields. Based on this principle, measurements campaigns were carried out in a radio base-station (RBS) of a local cellular phone company. The objective of this work is to evaluate the levels of non-ionizing radiation that the population, inhabiting adjacent areas of the RBS, is submitted. These measures, which comprise the database used in this article, show the relationship power versus distance used to calculate the far field (electric field in the region). This field is used to calculate the levels of exposure to non-ionizing radiation (NIR) that the general population is exposed (this is in accordance with Regulation of the Brazilian Telecommunication Agency - ANATEL). This also considers whether one needs an immediate downsizing of power radiated or a possible relocation station.

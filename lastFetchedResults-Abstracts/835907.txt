Furrow irrigation is one of the surface irrigation methods that hereby, increase of its efficiency using optimal design and management tools were considered. In this research, a new methodology was presented to determine optimal furrow length and inlet flow rate using simulation- optimization model for three regimes including continuous, cutback, and surge regimes, and their performance were evaluated using field data of clay loam texture. To  evaluate the effects of soil texture on optimization results, optimization processes were applied for sandy loam and clay soil texture. In clay loam soil, continuous regime showed longer optimal furrow length than other regimes. Surge regime needed higher inlet flow rate and shorter furrow length than other regimes to achieve maximum irrigation water efficiency and uniform distribution. Also, in continuous regime, optimal furrow length and objective function changes showed irrigation efficiency decrease by increasing inlet flow rate. According to investigation of the effect of objective functions on optimal furrow length, objective functions including combination of application efficiency and uniform distribution, or combination of tail water and deep percolation, are recommended for furrow design and management.

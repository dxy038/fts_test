Aiming at the problem of geomagnetic navigation relying on prior knowledge, this paper present a bio-inspired search navigate model for AUV using geomagnetic information without any priori knowledge. At first, we generalize the biologic navigation process as a convergence of geomagnetic multi-objective from the present point values to object point values problems is inspired by animal geomagnetic navigation behavior. Then, a random walk model is employed to describe AUV motion model and a stress evolution algorithm is used to obtain the parameters of navigate. The interaction between solving the problem of multi-objective navigation with searching navigation motion will guide the AUV tasks to achieve. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm allows the AUV to navigate efficiently using geomagnetic information without prior map. The proposed algorithm offers insights into the research and application of the biologically inspired geomagnetic navigation.

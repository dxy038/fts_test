The issue on how to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) is one of the hot topics for Test-Bed in cloud computing environment. In this paper, a new QoS evaluation model is proposed based on the evaluation index system. Firstly, the key parameters of QoS are determined as subjective index, objective index and the third-party index based on the evaluation index system. Then, a reasonable method is introduced to quantify the related indexes. Furthermore, the utility function is applied to evaluate the service from different providers. Finally, an experimental case is analyzed to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method and the empirical results show that the method can effectively help the client to find the optimal services.

The design of &#8220;stretcher&#8211;compressor&#8221; using aperiodic multilayers (aMLs) for attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region is presented. We use a single-objective temporal optimization method based on a genetic algorithm (GA) to maximize pulse reflection efficiency for a single mirror. Employing this method, we studied the relationships of optimal number of layers, achievable energy reflectivity, and pulse duration. We then apply the findings to a design of an attosecond &#8220;stretcher&#8211;compressor&#8221; configuration with much improved overall throughput for a near-transform-limited attosecond pulse in a multimirror system.

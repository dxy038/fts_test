We consider the shortest path problem in a communication network with random link costs drawn from unknown distributions. A realization of the total end-to-end cost is obtained when a path is selected for communication. The objective is an online learning algorithm that minimizes the total expected communication cost in the long run. The problem is formulated as a multi-armed bandit problem with dependent arms, and an algorithm based on basis-based learning integrated with a Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) is developed.

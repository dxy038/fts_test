Based on a discussion of channel characteristics and the design objective of a high overall link availability, it is shown that a frequency-hopping communication system using phase-shift-keying modulation can overcome the problems of the more traditional narrowband communication systems. The design parameters of such a system are then discussed. The performance is evaluated, and results of measurements in testbeds and on the power mains are presented

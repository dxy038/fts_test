Objective
This case study is about an 11-year-old girl with bilateral facial weakness,
abnormal taste sensation, and absent deep tendon reflexes of both knees and
ankles. However, the muscle power of the lower and upper extremities across
all muscle groups was normal. After 2 days, she developed paresthesia and
numbness in the lower extremities. Other neurologic examinations, such as
fundoscopic evaluation of the retina were normal with the muscle power of
both upper- and lower-extremities intact. A lumbar puncture revealed albumincytological
dissociation. EMG and NCV were in favor of Guillain-Barre
syndrome, for which IVIG was prescribed and the abnormal sensations in the
lower limbs rapidly improved. Bilateral facial diplegia without weakness and
paresthesia is a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome that mostly presents with
acute onset, rapid progression with or without limb weakness, paresthesia, and
decreased or absent DTR and albumin-cytological dissociation

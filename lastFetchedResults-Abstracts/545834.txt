Objective: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is an illicit, recreational drug
that causes cellular death and neurotoxicity. This study evaluates the effects of different
doses of MDMA on the expression of apoptosisâ€“related proteins and genes in the hippocampus
of adult rats.
Materials and Methods: In this expremental study,a total of 20 male Sprague Dawley rats
(200-250 g ) were treated with MDMA (0, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg i.p. twice daily) for 7 days. Seven
days after the last administration of MDMA, the rats were killed. Bax and Bcl-2 genes
in addition to protein expressions were detected by western blot and reverse transcriptionpolymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR).Results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and
p?0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: Our results showed that MDMA caused dose dependent up-regulation of Bax
and down-regulation of Bcl-2 in the hippocampus. There was a significant alteration in
bcl-2 and bax genes density.
Conclusion: Changes in apoptosis-related proteins and respective genes relating to Bax
and Bcl-2 might be involved in the molecular mechanism of MDMA-induced apoptosis.

The Optimization model is established with two objects, which are the maximal generation of and the firm power in certain probability. The NSGA-II is applied to simulate optimal operating strategies based on a 10 year data set. Two representative algorithms, dynamic programming with successive approximation (SADP) and discrete differential dynamic programming, are also applied to evaluate simulation performance. The result demonstrates that both the annual generation and the firm power of cascade system, derived from NSGA-II, are superior to the traditional strategy and the other two algorithms. It indicated that NSGA-II exhibits obvious advantage on solution of complex multi-variable and multi-objective problems on comparison with other traditional optimization algorithms.

&#8220;Traditional&#8221; risk modeling formalisms (e.g. FMEA, Fault Trees, Markov Processes, etc.) are well mastered by safety analysts. Efficient algorithms and tools are available. However, models designed with these formalisms are far from the specifications of the systems under study. They are consequently hard to design and to maintain throughout the life cycle of systems. The high-level modeling language AltaRica has been created to tackle this problem. The objective of the AltaRica 3.0 project is to design a new version of AltaRica, and to develop a complete set of authoring, simulation and assessment tools to perform safety analyses: virtual experiments on systems, via models, calculation of different kinds of reliability indicators, etc. AltaRica 3.0 improves significantly the expressive power of AltaRica Data-Flow without decreasing the efficiency of its assessment algorithms. Prototypes of a Fault Tree compiler, a stochastic and a stepwise simulators have been already developed. Other tools are under specification or implementation.

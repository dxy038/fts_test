A study on the prevalence of gastro-intestinal endoparasites in indigenous chicken was carried out in three regions in Kenya. The objective of the study was to determine the species and their prevalence rates. A total of 710 adult free-ranging local chickens were sampled from six districts, Kakamega (162), Bondo (81), Narok (81), Bomet (150), Turkana (70) and West Pokot (166). Qualitative and quantitative microscopic parasitological examinations were used for faecal examination. The survey showed that 192 (27.04%) was infected with Coccidial oocysts, 182 (25.63%) with Ascaridia galli, 10 (1.41%) with Heterakis gallinarum, 2 (0.3%) with Syngamus trachea, 37 (5.21%) with Capillaria retunsa, 8.45% with Capillaria annulata, 21 (2.96%) with Raillietina tetragona, 94 (13.24%), while 112 (15.8%) were negative, with no helminthes infestation. The findings suggested that endoparasites are a common health problem in free range indigenous chicken in Kenya and agro-climate significantly influenced the distribution of endoparasites.

The objective of this effort is to develop a global but regionalized water cycle model which by proper linkages can be used within the multilevel model of the world system. The concern is with issues broader than questions of water resources as such. The water model is based on the regionalization adopted for the total project; its structure and equations have been developed and programmed for use in computer analysis. Parameters are estimated for various regions and the usefullness of the model is assessed by means of a preliminary analysis of alternative scenario regarding future developments.

Today, Air Traffic keep increasing, for this raison, many research programs focus on collision avoidance technique. Aircraft trajectory prediction is a critical issue for Air Traffic Management (ATM). A safe and efficient prediction is a prerequisite for the implementation of automated tools that detect and solve conflicts between trajectories. Moreover, regarding the safety constraints, it could be more reasonable to predict intervals rather than precise aircraft positions. This paper a twofold objective; the first one, we develop an approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), called Optimization of Multilayer Perceptron Architecture (OMPA), the second one, we use this approach to forecast trajectory in vertical plane to solve conflicts between two aircrafts in airspace.

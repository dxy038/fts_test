The objective of this study was to determine the effect of deoxynivalenol (DON) on in vitro rumen fermentation by assessing pH, ammonia-N, total gas, volatile fatty acid (VFA) production, and DON degradation under the context of two different carbon sources (corn starch or cellulose). Fifty millilitre of ruminal fluid:buffer (1:1) was incubated for up to 6 h with four possible treatments: corn starch 1.5 g, corn starch 1.5 g + DON at 40 mg/kg dry matter (DM), cellulose 1.5 g, and cellulose 1.5 g + DON at 40 mg/kg DM. Our results indicate that carbon source appears to markedly influence all rumen fermentative parameters (P&lt;0.05), whereas DON negatively impacted certain aspects of rumen fermentative capacity, such as ammonia-N and total gas production, especially acetate and propionate production having been reduced (P&lt;0.01). Therefore, it may be possible for carbon source to influence and limit the degree upon which DON's effects are exerted. DON degradation rate was especially influenced by carbon source context (P=0.0105) with cellulose leading to a higher rate of DON degradation than that of corn starch. This would indicate that concentrate/forage ratio, in the diet, may have an effect on DON degradation.

The interleaved bidirectional converter (IBC) has lower input current ripple and higher power conversion efficiency than the bidirectional chopper because of the current sharing operation. However, the step up/down ratio of the IBC is the same as that of the bidirectional chopper. As a converter with high step up ratio, the two-phase interleaved DC-DC converter with parallel-input series-output connection (ICPS) is proposed. The ICPS realizes twice the step up ratio of the interleaved boost converter. Also, the ICPS has lower input ripple than the interleaved boost converter at the same step up ratio. This paper proposes bidirectional operation of the ICPS, which realizes the high step up/down ratio and the reduction of current ripple on the low voltage side. The proposed bidirectional operational principles and the steady-state analysis have been verified by simulation and circuit experiment.

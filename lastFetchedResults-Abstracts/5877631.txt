Patterns of faults that are catastrophic for regular architectures, particularly the systolic arrays, have been studied. For a given link configuration, there are many fault patterns which are catastrophic. Among those, there is a particular fault pattern, called the reference fault pattern, which is crucial for the development of testing techniques; furthermore, the efficiency of any testing algorithm can be further improved in the presence of efficient algorithms for constructing the reference fault pattern. The authors develop a new algorithm for the construction of the reference fault pattern for VLSI reconfigurable arrays in which the links are bidirectional. The complexity of the new algorithm is <e1>O</e1>(<e1>kN</e1>) which is a significant improvement over the existing <e1>O</e1>(<e1>N</e1><sup>2 </sup>) algorithm, where <e1>k</e1> is the number of bypass links, and <e1>N</e1> is the length of the largest bypass link

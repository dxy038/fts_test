A new robust to noise algorithm for mammographic image segmentation is presented in this paper. Its main objective is the separation of breast and background, establishing correctly the boundaries of the breast. The algorithm is a combination of several image processing operations such as histogram specification, re-sampling, histogram adjustment, arithmetic and morphological operations. It was tested in mini-MIAS database of mammograms with very satisfactory results with 97% of correct segmentation.

The Istanbul Transportation Information System has been established for the purpose of processing and storing data in a computer environment to arrange, in its most general sense, management service, coordination and planning activities related to transportation. The information system for this objective is one that is composed of a series of hardware and software components including data storage, data processing, data analysis and representation functions. A database called the transportation information system for evaluating the graphical and non-graphical data for the city of Istanbul has been formed. Moreover, some analyses are performed toward design and optimization based on a single intersection. Up-to-date data are accessed with an appropriate interrogation easily and efficiently

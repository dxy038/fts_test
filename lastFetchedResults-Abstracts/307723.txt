Objective:
We examined the association of plasma apolipoprotein (apoB) B-48, remnant-like particle (RLP)-cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol concentrations with apoB-100 kinetics in overweight-obese men.
Methods and results:
Very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apoB-100 kinetics were measured in 53 men (BMI 33 Â± 4 kg/m2) using stable isotopes and multicompartmental modeling to estimate production rate (PR) and fractional catabolic rate (FCR). Fasting apoB-48 and RLP-cholesterol concentrations were measured using immunoassays. In univariate regression, apoB-48 and RLP-cholesterol were inversely associated with VLDL-apoB-100 FCR and IDL-apoB-100 FCR (P < 0.01 for all), but not with VLDL-, IDL- and LDL-apoB-100 PRs. Plasma non-HDL-cholesterol concentration was significantly and positively associated with the secretion rate of VLDL-apoB-100 (P < 0.05), and inversely correlated with the FCR of LDL-apoB-100 (P < 0.01).
Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that in overweight-obese men plasma concentrations of apoB-48, RLP-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol are partly dependent on catabolism of apoB-100 containing lipoproteins.

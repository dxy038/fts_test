To address performance anomaly problem in conventional wireless LAN, proportional fair(PF) rate allocation schemes for IEEE 802.11e wireless LAN has been recently reported. However, as it is based on logarithmic utility objective function, it only realizes only a single point in throughput-fairness tradeoff range. For general wireless scheduling, generalized PF(GPF) scheduling framework has been proposed recently. The GPF framework has the ability to arbitrary control the tradeoff between total throughput and fairness among users. In this paper, we extend the PF rate allocation schemes to GPF rate allocation schemes so that we can control the throughput-fairness tradeoff as desired. We combine the PF rate allocation schemes with the GPF framework and derive two GPF rate allocation schemes. Effectiveness of our schemes is verified through simulations.

This paper presents the design optimization of a Delta-like robot manipulator with respect to multiple global stiffness objectives. For this purpose, a systematic elasto-geometrical modeling method is used to derive the analytical manipulator stiffness models by taking into account their link and joint compliances. The models are then involved within a statistically sensitivity analysis of the influence of the geometric parameters on four global indices that describe the structure stiffness over the workspace. Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm, i.e. Pareto-optimization, is taken as the appropriate framework for the definition and the solution of the addressed multi-objective optimization problem. Our approach is original in the sense that it is systematic and it can be applied to any serial and parallel manipulators for which stiffness is a critical issue.

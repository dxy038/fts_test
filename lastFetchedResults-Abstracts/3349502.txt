The idea we explore in this paper is whether we can use input reconstruction methods for control problems. In input reconstruction problems, the outputs of a dynamical system are known, and the objective is to reconstruct the inputs to the system that caused the measured outputs. Command following problems can be viewed from a similar perspective. The desired outputs of the system are known and the control inputs that would yield those desired outputs have to be determined. In that sense, by implicitly assuming that a control input exists such that the output of the system will be equal to the desired output, one can use input reconstruction to determine the corresponding control inputs by pretending that the the desired outputs are the actual outputs of the system. With this end in view we explore a few control schemes based on the filter-based approach to input reconstruction and demonstrate the efficacy of these methods with illustrative numerical examples.

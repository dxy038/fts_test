In this study, a theoretical model for the combination of all individual questions from a questionnaire is investigated. For this implementation, a well-fitted Elman neural network is used in order to formulate the weighting relations between questions of the questionnaire which is produced for the project &#8220;Innovative Services to Strengthen Cooperation and Internationalization between SMEs&#8221; (I.S.C.I.) which has as objective the internationalization processes of the agro food industry of the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) (in Apulia Region, Italy, and in Ionian Islands, Greece). The aim of this study is the evaluation of the above questionnaire using a data mining technique in which the mental processing of an expert is linking with the Elman Neural Network. For this reason a proper questionnaire was used in order to classify the SMEs into three (3) classes according to their performance.

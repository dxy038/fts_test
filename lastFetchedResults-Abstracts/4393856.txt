Energy Systems are rapidly evolving, driven by a combination of factors, including cost, efficiency, environmental impact and security-of-supply, while being facilitated by increased deregulation. This complexity is facilitated by the rollout of complex Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT) systems that will play a significant role in operating, managing, planning, and securing the energy infrastructure. SmartGrid is an umbrella term used to describe the broad scope of interdependent systems that make up this modernized grid. These systems cover the full life cycle of energy from generation to transmission, distribution, and consumption. SmartGrid through use of ICT enables bidirectional flows of energy between these component systems and uses two-way communication and control capabilities to maintain efficiency, availability, and robustness. SmartGrid will bring about significant economic and environmental benefits to consumers, organisations, and countries, all facilitated by ICT. This paper provides a high level overview of the role of ICT in SmartGrid, focusing on some of the key issues.

The objective of the study was to examine the effect of alkali ion release, pH control and buffer capacity on the expression of the osteoblastic phenotype. In addition, we determined the importance of modifications of the surface of porous bioactive glass (BG) on the activity of rat calvaria osteoblasts in vitro. We found that at a low tissue culture medium (TCM) volume to BG surface area (Vol/SA) ratio, the products of glass corrosion elevated the pH of the TCM to a value that adversely affected cellular activity; thus, the matrix synthesized by the cells was non-mineralized. On the other hand, when the Vol/SA was high and the buffer capacity of the medium was not exceeded, the cells generated a mineralized extracellular matrix. Addressing the second issue, we observed that modification of the composition of the BG surface markedly influenced osteoblast activity. BG that was coated with either a calcium phosphate-rich layer only or a serum protein layer changed the phenotypic characteristics of the osteoblasts. The presence of either of these surfaces lowered the alkaline phosphatase activity of the attached cells; this finding indicated that the osteoblast phenotype was not conserved. However, when the BG was coated with a bilayer of calcium phosphate and serum proteins, the alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity was elevated and the extracellular matrix contained characteristic bone markers. Our findings indicate that the calcium phosphate-rich layer promotes adsorption and concentration of proteins from the TCM, and it is utilized by the osteoblasts to form the mineralized extracellular matrix.

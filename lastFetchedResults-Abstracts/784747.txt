Objective: To assess the association of nutritional status with sex, age, race/color, education, smoking,
physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, and hospitalization in older adults residing in the city of Havana, Cuba.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional, population-based household survey. A total of 1,905 persons (1,197 women
and 708 men; ≥ 60 years) were examined between 1999 and 2000, selected by probabilistic sampling. Nutritional
status was assessed by body mass index (BMI): BMI < 22,0 kg/m2 = underweight; BMI > 27,0 kg/m2 =
overweight. Multinomial logistic regression analysis (crude and adjusted) was used. Results: The estimation of
the prevalence of underweight was 33.0% and that of overweight was 29.6%. The adjusted regression model
showed that the probability of underweight was higher in older age groups (OR = 1.63, 70-79 years; OR = 2.05, ≥
80 years) and among smokers (OR = 1.83). There was negative association between underweight, and
hypertension and diabetes. Hypertension (OR = 1.99) was positively associated with overweight. The lower
likelihood of overweight was observed among men, smokers, and those aged 80 years and more. Conclusion: The
elderly population of Havana presents a vulnerable nutritional status in view of the prevalence of underweight
and overweight. Increasing age, smoking, gender, and hypertension are the factors positively associated with
vulnerable nutritional status

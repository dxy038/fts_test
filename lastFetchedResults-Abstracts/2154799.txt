In this study by using multi-criteria techniques, Lorestan province; because of unique mountainous texture and the existence heights and peaks above 4000 meters; is identified one of the most capable provinces in terms of geomorphological phenomena. The main objective of this research is considering the geomorphologic and climatic conditions of region to identify winter geo-tourism areas (ski places) in the LORESTAN province. In this study, maps after being built in GIS and ENVI software, by (ANP) and (AHP) models, determined and used TOPSIS model in ARC GIS software to identify the final map prone areas of winter tourism.

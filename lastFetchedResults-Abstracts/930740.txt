The objective of this study was to determine the effects of different manufacturing processes of Galotyri-type cheese on its chemical and sensory characteristics, with the aim to help cheesemakers to produce cheese of more consistent and high quality. Three cheesemaking methods were evaluated, namely production of cheese using salted ewesâ€™ milk, starter culture and rennet (SM + R), and starter culture with or without rennet and salting the curd after draining (R + SC or SC, respectively). The SC cheese had significantly (P < 0.05) higher moisture and lower fat and protein contents than the other two cheeses made with rennet. No significant (P > 0.05) differences in fat-in-dry matter, lactose, salt, salt-in-moisture, ash, pH, acidity and yield were observed among the cheeses studied. The cheesemaking method significantly affected cheese proteolysis as shown by the determination of water soluble nitrogen (WSN). Omission of rennet during Galotyri-type cheese preparation resulted in reduced proteolysis during manufacture and storage. The SM + R cheese had higher levels of WSN than the other cheeses throughout storage. No bitterness or off-flavour was noted by any member of the taste panel in SC and R + SC cheeses. On the contrary, the SM + R cheese exhibited slight bitterness and unclean flavour after 15 days from manufacture. The R + SC cheese had the most consistent quality during storage and was the most preferred by the panelists

This paper is concerned with a deadbeat tracking problem of continuous-time systems. The control objective is to achieve complete (or deadbeat) tracking in finite time. The purpose of this paper is to give a design method for achieving deadbeat tracking in multivariable continuous-time systems. A special feature of the method is to use delay elements in the controller (instead of sample-and-hold devices)

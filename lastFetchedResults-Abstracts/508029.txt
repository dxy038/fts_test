In this paper, the portfolio selection problem is considered, where fuzziness and randomness appear simultaneously in optimization process. Since return and dividend play an important role in such problems, a new model is developed in a mixed environment by incorporating fuzzy random variable as multi-objective nonlinear model. Then a novel interactive approach is proposed to determine the preferred solution. Finally a numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed model.

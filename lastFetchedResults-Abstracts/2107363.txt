In this paper, optimization and control of a tubular reactor for thermal bulk post-polymerization of styrene have been investigated. By using the reactor mathematical model, static and dynamic simulations are carried out. Based on an objective function including polymer conversion and polydispersity, reactor optimal temperature profile has been obtained. In the absence of model mismatch, desired product characteristic can also be obtained by applying the corresponding reactor wall or jacket temperature profile. To achieve this temperature trajectory, reactor jacket is divided into three zones and jacket inlet temperatures are used as manipulated variables. Effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated through computer simulation. Furthermore for a special case of model mismatch, a method has been proposed which results in a near optimal profile. Â

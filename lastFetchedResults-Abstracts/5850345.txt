Since 1997, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) been acquiring and deploying Advanced Technology Explosives Detection Devices (AT) for some U.S domestic airport facilities. This initiative was in response to recommendations put forth by the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security (the Gore Commission). The primary objective of this effort has been to gain operational experience of ATs in U.S. airports. This paper will address the technologies, system integration issues, operational characteristics and their application in the airport for screening checked baggage. It will outline the deployment lessons learned in various operational configurations and equipment/system performance trade-offs of four types of ATs. Without revealing sensitive and proprietary data, it will discuss each type of ATÂ´s principle of operation and performance factors such as throughput, detection, and false alarm rate

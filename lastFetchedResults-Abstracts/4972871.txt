The objective of this qualitative study was to explore and understand the conditions that influence software testing as an online service and elicit important research issues. Interviews were conducted with managers from eleven organizations. The study used qualitative grounded theory as its research method. The results indicate that the demand for software testing as an online service is on the rise and is influenced by conditions such as the level of domain knowledge needed to effectively test an application, flexibility and cost effectiveness as benefits, security and pricing as top requirements, cloud computing as the delivery mode and the need for software testers to hone their skills. Potential research areas suggested include application areas best suited for online software testing, pricing and handling of test data among others.

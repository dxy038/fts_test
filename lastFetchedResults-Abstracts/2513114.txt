The exercise time duration was one hour and was carried out three times per week for three months.Â  Emotional, behavioral, electrolyte, autonomic, neurovegatative and skin symptoms of PMS were compared between two groups. P value was considered significant at &lt; 0.05.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> A significant difference was observed for electrolytic, neurovegetative and cognitive symptoms before and after the exercise.

The paper focuses on numerical evaluation of electromagnetic fields set up by overhead transmission lines, the principal objective of the paper, which reports preliminary work, is to develop the principles and concepts together with their validation. For this purpose, a system of conductors parallel to the earth plane is considered. In this case, the field problem is reduced to one with two dimensions only. However, the extension to a 3-dimensional case will be conceptually straightforward. The finite difference method (TDM) is simple to formulate and can readily be extended to two or three-dimensional problems and requires less computational work than the finite element method (FEM) and more recently, with the advent of numerical grid generation approach, the FDM has become comparable to FEM in dealing with irregular geometries. A formulation based on FDM for solving the 2 dimensional electromagnetic field problem is presented in the paper. In this approach, derivatives are replaced by equivalent differences, to calculate the electric and magnetic field subject to the boundary conditions of continuity in both horizontal and vertical components of magnetic fields at the earth plane. The goal of this work is to develop software to implement a comprehensive and general set of FDM equations derived from the MaxwellÂ´s equation set applicable to the region in the air, on the earth plane, and in the body of the earth. The software gives accurate results and uses the biconjugate gradient method to compute the solution of a sparse system.

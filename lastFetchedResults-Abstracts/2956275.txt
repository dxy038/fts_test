We consider multiobjective linear programming problem with interval objective functions. One solution for this problem is called a necessarily efficient solution, that is efficient for every possible perturbation of coefficients within given intervals, which can be regarded as a kind of robust solution for optimal control problems. We improve the simplex based multiobjective problem solving method for generating a set of necessarily efficient solutions of multiobjective linear optimal control problems

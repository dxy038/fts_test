Meteorology Grid Computing aims to provide scientist with seamless, reliable, secure and inexpensive access to meteorological resources. In this paper, we presented a semantic-based meteorology grid service registry, discovery and composition framework by combining grid technologies and the advantages of semantic web techniques. The main objective of the framework is to support automating the discovery, selection, and workflow composition of semantically described heterogeneous meteorological grid services, which offers the possibility of facilitating geographically distributed meteorological scientists to resolve complex scientific problems cooperately. With this framework, the key technologies such as semantic registry, semantic matchmaking, QoS ranking and composition model, will be discussed.

The use of virtual learning environments is more and more common as a support tool for classroom activities. In this case the objective of these environments is to provide pedagogic tools and methodologies to enhance the teaching-learning process. The main objective of this paper is to present the Dependence Map, a pedagogical tool that allows the teacher to plan a subject of study and its evaluation, based on educational aims, not on programmatic contents. Furthermore, this work presents a methodology, in which the Dependence Map is inserted, that includes the use of modern pedagogic theories. Also, the proposed methodology is being implemented in a software module under development, in order to be inserted in a VLE.

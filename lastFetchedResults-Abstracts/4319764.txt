We describe an algorithm for solving a single machine scheduling problem with additional assumptions motivated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. In the operating model, the setup times are sequence dependent and the objective is to minimize the total production time. An application of the algorithm to the real MRI examination results in an increase of the scanner workflow.

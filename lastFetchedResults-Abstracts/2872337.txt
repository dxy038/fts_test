In this paper, we consider the coordinated charging control of electrical vehicle (EV) in the charging stations. The goals are to minimize the total charging cost of all the vehicles at the charging station, respecting subscription type to electricity for charging station. The algorithm is based on a given future electricity prices and uses linear programming. This cost reduction of charging being achieved through bidirectional power flow between vehicles and grid. Thus functionalities of electrical vehicle can be divided into two aspects: on one hand, battery of the EV can be considered as a variable load. With optimal charging or smart charging for the battery, vehicle owners could maximize their profits by purchasing energy, G2V (Grid to Vehicle), at the lowest possible electricity price and in on the other hand, battery of the EV canal so be considered as energy storage capacity which has possibility to provide energy V2G (Vehicle to Grid). After the simulations performed by applying this strategy to coordinate EV charging, we achieved a cost reduction with 20% from the initial cost.

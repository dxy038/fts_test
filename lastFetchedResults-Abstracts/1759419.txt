Objective
ess the impact of a managed care-based patient reminder/recall system on immunization rates and preventive care visits among low-income adolescents.
s
ducted a randomized controlled trial between December 2009 and December 2010 that assigned adolescents aged 11â€“17 years to one of three groups: mailed letter, telephone reminders, or control. Publicly insured youths (n = 4115) were identified in 37 participating primary care practices. The main outcome measures were immunization rates for routine vaccines (meningococcus, pertussis, HPV) and preventive visit rates at study end.
s
ention and control groups were similar at baseline for demographics, immunization rates, and preventive visits. Among adolescents who were behind at the start, immunization rates at study end increased by 21% for mailed (P &lt; .01 vs control), 17% for telephone (P &lt; .05), and 13% for control groups. The proportion of adolescents with a preventive visit (within 12 months) was: mailed (65%; P &lt; .01), telephone (63%; P &lt; .05), and controls (59%). The number needed to treat for an additional fully vaccinated adolescent was 14 for mailed and 25 for telephone reminders; for an additional preventive visit, it was 17 and 29. The intervention cost $18.78 (mailed) or $16.68 (phone) per adolescent per year to deliver. The cost per additional adolescent fully vaccinated was $463.99 for mailed and $714.98 for telephone; the cost per additional adolescent receiving a preventive visit was $324.75 and $487.03.
sions
d care-based mail or telephone reminder/recall improved adolescent immunizations and preventive visits, with modest costs and modest impact.

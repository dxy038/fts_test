The objective of this study is to investigate the use of electromyography (EMG) signals and video based soft tissue deformation (STD) analysis for identifying the gait patterns of healthy and injured subjects. The system includes a wireless surface electromyography (EMG) sensor unit and two video camera systems for measuring the neuromuscular activity of lower limb muscles, and a custom-developed artificial neural network based intelligent system software for identifying the gait patterns of subjects during walking activity. The system uses root mean square (RMS) value of EMG signals and soft tissue deformation parameter (STDP) as the input features. In order to estimate the STD during a muscular contraction while walking, flexible triangular meshes are built on reference points. The positions of these selected points are evaluated by applying the block matching motion estimation technique. Based on the extracted features, multilayer feed-forward backpropagation networks (FFBPNNs) with different network training functions were designed and their classification performances were compared. The system has been tested for a group of healthy and injured subjects. The results showed that FFBPNN with Levenberg-Marquardt training function provided better prediction behavior (98% overall accuracy) as compared to FFBPNN with other training functions for gait patterns identification based on RMS value of EMG and STDP.

The primary objective of the Nighttime Solar Cell<sup>TM</sup> is to produce electric power at night. The lack of energy production when there is no incident solar energy is a major drawback to photovoltaic cells. Nighttime utilization of the new device produces electrical energy using a thermoelectric generator (TEG) operating in the temperature differential that exists between deep space at an effective temperature of 4 K and the surrounding ambient temperature (nominally at 300 K). Thus the ambient or surroundings of the device are the source of thermal energy while deep space provides a thermal sink. The cold junction of the TEG is insulated from the surroundings by a vacuum cell, improving its overall effectiveness. This research is an on-going effort to develop a clean, reliable, safe, inexpensive, alternate source of electric power using deep space. The model discussed herein investigates the many design parameters that influence electrical power production including semiconductor configuration, cold junction plate area and depth of vacuum required in the cell for acceptable performance

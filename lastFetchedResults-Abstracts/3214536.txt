Multidimensional scaling is a technique for exploratory analysis of multidimensional data, whose essential part is optimization of a function possessing many adverse properties including multi objectivities, multimodality, and non differentiability etc.,. In this paper, global optimization algorithms for multi Objective problems are chosen for different kind of problems especially in the power Industry. Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization Technique (APSO) is a global optimization algorithm applied to the single phase three level and three phase three level diode clamped multi level inverter, in which Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is taken as an objective function. Different optimized pulse patterns are obtained by the Accelerated particle swarm optimization technique (APSO), these multi level inverters are simulated in MATLAB and results are shown to be better than recently reported work.

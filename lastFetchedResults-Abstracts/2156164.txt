In this study, a carbon paste electrode modified with TiO2 nanoparticles and ferrocene monocarboxylic acid (FM) was used to prepare a novel electrochemical sensor. The objective of this novel electrode modification was to seek new electrochemical performances for the detection of methyldopa in the presence of folic acid and glycine. The peak potentials recorded in a phosphate buffer solution (PBS) of pH 7.0 were 325, 750 and 880 mV vs. Ag/AgCl/KCl (3.0 M) for methyldopa, folic acid and glycine, respectively. Under the optimum pH of 7.0, the oxidation of methyldopa occurred at a potential about 160 mV less positive than that of the unmodified carbon paste electrode (CPE). The response of catalytic current with methyldopa concentration showed a linear relation in the range from 2.0 × 10− 7 to 1.0 × 10− 4 M with a detection limit of 8.0 (± 0.2) × 10− 8 M.

Active queue management achieves the objective of congestion control in some degree, and is becoming a research focus in the Internet community. Most of the existing AQM algorithms follow the probability-based packet dropping mechanism originated from RED, which goes against the router performance optimization because random number generation requires rather computational effort. In this paper, we define a congestion index to indicate the degree of the network congestion. Then, a novel intelligent packet dropping mechanism is designed based on fuzzy logic. The off-line integration greatly simplifies on-line process, which is very beneficial in order to optimize the router performance. The simulation results show that the intelligent mechanism is superior to the classical RED algorithm.

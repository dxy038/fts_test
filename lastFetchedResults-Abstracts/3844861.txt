The main contribution of this paper is the design of a new clamp circuit for an AC/DC converter topology based on ac/ac matrix converter theory. The drive is capable of delivering 250-A DC from a three-phase 480-V AC source while keeping the insulated gate bipolar transistor voltage and current within the safe operating area of the devices. The power level required by the dc drive discussed in This work presents several design challenges which have been overcome with innovative solutions. An example is the clamp circuitry, necessary for the safe operation of the bidirectional switches, which is described, analyzed and demonstrated experimentally.

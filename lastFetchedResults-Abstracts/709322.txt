The objective of this quasi-experimental design study was to evaluate an 8-week course of research utilization training provided for nurses. Eighty-nine nurses participated in the complete study. Age and education background of the nurses in the control group matched that of the participants in the experimental group. The research instruments included a scale of attitudes toward nursing research, a scale of perceived support for nursing research, a research participation questionnaire, and a research utilization questionnaire. Repeated measures analysis of covariance and the Mannâ€“Whitney U test were adopted for statistical analysis. The results showed that there were significant differences in attitudes between the two groups toward research and perceived support of institutions. Participation in research also differed significantly when analyzed at posttests 2 and 6 months after the course. There was no significant difference in research utilization. These results suggest that continuous consultation and assistance should be provided to the nurses after the course, so as to implement the results of research utilization.

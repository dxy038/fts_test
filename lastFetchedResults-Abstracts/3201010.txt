In this paper we discuss throughput analysis for fixed allocation of channels in a cognitive radio network. In fixed allocation of channels number of primary users allocated to a channel is fixed all the time. But the number of primary users is different for different channels. The secondary users or cognitive users sense the channel whether the channel is free or not. But sometimes when secondary users access the channel then primary users arrive and collision occurs. The transmission probabilities of primary and secondary users are different. The packet transmission delay and channel access delay of secondary users is considered in this paper. Our objective is to find the optimal number of secondary users to maximize the total throughput of primary and secondary users.

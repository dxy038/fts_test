The objective of this correspondence is to design a fixed-order H <sub>2</sub> optimal inverse filter of a given periodic FIR digital filter in the presence of measurement noise. The problem is solved by using a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach to an equivalent time-invariant H<sub>2</sub> optimization problem constructed by applying the lifting technique to the original periodic problem. An example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach

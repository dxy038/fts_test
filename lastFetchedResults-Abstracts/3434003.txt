The world has witnessed explosive growth in the use of personal storage devices such as USB flash drives. Until recently, no standard authentication method existed for these devices.

IEEE 1667 defines bidirectional TSD authentication: the host can authenticate the TSD´s identity, and the TSD can also authenticate the host´s identity

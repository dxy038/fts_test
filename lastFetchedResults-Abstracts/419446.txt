The aim of this study was to compare objectively and subjectively the results after temporalis tendon and microneurovascular transfer for reanimation of the paralysed face.

For the objective analysis, measurements of the distances between static and dynamic points in three-dimensional space were performed at rest and during smiling. The patients were assessed subjectively by non-professionals scoring videotapes.

The range of motion of the oral commissure on smiling was 1.7 mm (0.8, mean and SE) after tendon and 5.5 mm (1.6) after microneurovascular transfer (P< 0.05) without showing teeth, and 0.6 mm (1.3) vs 3.6 mm (2.4, ns) with showing teeth. Compared with the healthy side, the excursions reached 6% (16) after tendon and 71% (26,P< 0.05) after microneurovascular transfer for smiling without, and â€“4% (14) vs 19% (14, ns) for smiling with showing teeth, respectively. Virtually no difference was found in the measurements at rest as well as in the subjective evaluation. Swelling of the cheek (28%) and tethering of the skin (24%) were shown to be the most disturbing symptoms after microneurovascular transfer.

Better excursion and symmetry of the oral commissure were achieved by microneurovascular reconstruction for voluntary smile. However, the aesthetic outcome after microneurovascular transfer is markedly impaired by chronic complications including swelling of the cheek and tethering of the skin, which were not detected by the three-dimensional measurement technique used. We conclude that the aesthetic appearance should be considered equally important as the range of motion in the reanimated face.

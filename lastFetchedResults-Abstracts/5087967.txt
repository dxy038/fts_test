In the inverse planning optimization of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Algorithm (MOPSA) is applied to optimization the test examples whose objective functions are based on average dose distribution and Dose-Volume Histogram (DVH) respectively. The calculation time, converge speed, numbers of non-inferior solution are compared with two kinds of objective functions. The results show that the objective function influence optimization process, and the DVH based objective function has the superiority in converge speed and the numbers of non-inferior solution.

We propose an efficient method for the form-finding of tensegrity structures. The force densities of each tensegrity are obtained by the minimisation of a particular objective function, leading to a semi-positive definite force density matrix (a super-stable tensegrity) with a required rank deficiency. A genetic algorithm is used as a global search technique for the minimisation. The geometry of a tensegrity is subsequently formed based on those eigenvectors of the force density matrix corresponding to zero eigenvalues. Furthermore, two other methods are introduced to convert the asymmetrical geometry obtained from the main algorithm into its symmetrical counterparts. This transformation in geometry is performed by finding a suitable linear combination of the mentioned eigenvectors. Examples from well-known tensegrities including prismatic, truncated tetrahedron, expandable octahedron and truncated icosahedron tensegrities are studied using the present method, and the results obtained are compared with those documented in the literature to verify the efficiency of the present method.

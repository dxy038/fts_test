New results concerned with the Lyapunov stability and with estimates of trajectory behavior and bounds of composite or interconnected systems, described by ordinary differential equations, are established. In all cases the objective is the same: to analyze composite systems in terms of their lower order subsystems and in terms of their interconnecting structure. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the present method, four specific examples are considered.

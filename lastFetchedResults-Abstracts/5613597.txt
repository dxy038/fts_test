Our research objective is to make two single-sided inverted-mesa type concave resonators on a quartz blank by etching process for bio-sensors and so forth. Then three kind of concave blanks were made for different resonating frequencies. By using dual-face polishing machine, the first blank was formed to be concave as 0.5 mum from front and rear sides (total 1.0 mum), the second one as 1.0 mum and the third one as 1.5 mum. The rear side of every concave blank was naturally made to be in convex lens shape. The changing height of convex lens shape blank was related to every quantity of polished quartz. Furthermore, the electrical property of every quartz resonator was reported to correspond to every polished amount of quartz

This paper presents a novel dc-dc converter configuration, which successfully integrates two technologies, including a switched capacitor and a switched coupled inductor, into one converter. By adopting a coupled inductor to charge a switched capacitor, the voltage gain can be effectively increased, and the turns ratio of the coupled inductor can be also reduced. Not only lower conduction losses but also higher power conversion efficiency is benefited from a lower part count and lower turns ratios. The proposed converter is simply composed of six components, which can be further derived to varied converters for different purposes, such as a bidirectional converter. The operating principle and steady-state analysis are discussed in this paper. A 250-W laboratory hardware prototype is completed and verified. The voltage gain is up to 11. The highest efficiency is 97.2%, and the full-load efficiency is kept at 93.6%.

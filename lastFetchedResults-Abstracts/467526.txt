Objective: We assessed and compared the quality of life, marital relationship, and sexual function of women who had urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) or detrusor overactivity (DO) diagnosed. Study Design: Women with the following urodynamic diagnoses, normal, USI, or DO, were compared by using the psychometric questionnaires: King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ, for quality of life), Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS, for marital relationship), and Derogatis Sexual Functioning Inventory (DSFI, for sexual function). Results: Women with DO (n = 29) were younger than healthy women (n = 28) and women with USI (n = 36) (P< .05). Women with USI or DO had a poorer quality of life (P< .05), poorer marital relationship (P< .05), and less sexual satisfaction (P< .05), despite having no change in sexual drive (P> .05). Regression analyses showed that only sexual satisfaction and incontinence-related emotions were associated with marital relationship (P< .05). Conclusion: Marital relationship and sexual function were negatively affected in women who had USI or DO. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1244-8.)

During the 20th century, oil, coal and natural gas were the most used by man power sources. These are being depleted to their widespread use in many areas. These sources used to produce energy, emit gaseous effluents containing greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming. The use of renewable energy proves thus indispensable. Indeed, they are clean and free of harmful effects on the environment. In this sense, energy from waste is a preferred route. The objective of this work is to contribute to the characterization of emissions from one type of food industry enjoyed active in Algeria, "the dairy industry." Biochemical and physic-chemical a property of liquid effluents studied analyzes were performed before and after various processing techniques made. Our results show that compounds partially or fully hydrolyzed whey represents a significant resource in particular (protein, fat, lactose ....) Who can subsequently be used in different areas: nutritional, technological, economic, agro-industries food and medical.

The fundamental challenge in design of Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) is proper utilization of resources which are scare. One of the critical challenges is to maximize the bandwidth utilization in data gathering from sensor nodes and forward to sink. The main design objective of this paper is to utilize the available bandwidth efficiently in terms of reduced packet delivery ratio and throughput. Bandwidth Efficient Heterogeneity aware Cluster based Data Aggregation (BHCDA) algorithm presents the solution for the effective data gathering with in-network aggregation. It considers the network with heterogeneous nodes in terms of energy and mobile sink to aggregate the data packets. It embodies the optimal approach by Intra and inter-cluster aggregation on the randomly distributed nodes with variable data generation rate while routing data to sink. It uses the correlation of data within the packet for applying the aggregation function on data generated by nodes. BHCDA shows significant improvement in packet delivery ratio (67.66 % &amp; 19.62 %) and throughput (37.01 % &amp; 17.16 %) as compared with the state-of-the-art solutions, Two Tier Cluster based Data Aggregation (TTCDA) and Energy Efficient Cluster based Data Aggregation (EECDA).

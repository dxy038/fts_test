Comparisons were made between three sets of meteorological fields used to support air quality predictions for the California Regional Particulate Air Quality Study (CRPAQS) winter episode from December 15, 2000 to January 6, 2001. The first set of fields was interpolated from observations using an objective analysis method. The second set of fields was generated using the WRF prognostic model without data assimilation. The third set of fields was generated using the WRF prognostic model with the four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) technique. The UCD/CIT air quality model was applied with each set of meteorological fields to predict the concentrations of airborne particulate matter and gaseous species in central California. The results show that the WRF model without data assimilation over-predicts surface wind speed by âˆ¼30% on average and consequently yields under-predictions for all PM and gaseous species except sulfate (S(VI)) and ozone(O3). The WRF model with FDDA improves the agreement between predicted and observed wind and temperature values and consequently yields improved predictions for all PM and gaseous species. Overall, diagnostic meteorological fields produced more accurate air quality predictions than either version of the WRF prognostic fields during this episode. Population-weighted average PM2.5 exposure is 40% higher using diagnostic meteorological fields compared to prognostic meteorological fields created without data assimilation. These results suggest diagnostic meteorological fields based on a dense measurement network are the preferred choice for air quality model studies during stagnant periods in locations with complex topography.

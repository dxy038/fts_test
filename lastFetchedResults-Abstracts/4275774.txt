Modeling and demonstrating, validating and evaluating by simulation experiment is an effectual method to study a complex warfare system. There are such obvious differences in the condition, demand and process of simulation between warfare system and general physical systems that this paper dissertates the relative research development of grid-based simulation, sets up a mapping from requirement and objective to framework and blue print to analyze the requirement, objective, framework and the key technical solution to the problem, and furthermore analyzes the running mode and process of grid-based complex warfare system simulation. A case study for land warfare system simulation is presented in this paper. The research fruit shows that grid-based simulation supports complex warfare system technology demonstrations in theory and practice, and provides a feasible approach.

Objective: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. Chemotherapeutic
agents have been shown to have adverse side-effects, and natural compounds
have been recommended for cancer treatment, nowadays. Crab shell has been shown to
have cancer preventative and suppressive effects in vivo and in vitro. The aim of present
study was to investigate the effect of crab shell extract on prostate cancer cell line (LNcap)
in vitro.
Materials and Methods: In this in vitro experimental study, LNcap cells were treated with
different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1000 ?g/ml) of crab shell hydroalcoholic
extract in three different culture periods (24, 48 and 72 hours). LNcap viability was
evaluated by trypan blue staining and MTT assay. Cell apoptosis and nitric oxide (NO) secretion
were determined by TUNEL and Griess assays, respectively. Data were analyzed
by one-way ANOVA test and P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: LNcap viability was decreased dose- and time-dependently. Thus 400, 800, and
1000 ?g/ml doses showed significant differences compared to control group (P < 0.001).
Dose-dependent increase in the apoptotic index was also observed in 800 and 1000 ?g/
ml concentrations (P < 0.001). Nitric oxide secretion of LNcap cell was decreased time- and
dose-dependently, while it was significant for 1000 ?g/ml (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Crab shell extract showed anti-prostate cancer effect, by inducing cell apoptosis
and decreasing NO production.

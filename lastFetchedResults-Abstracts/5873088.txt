This study applies a fuzzy simple additive weighting system (FSAWS) to investigate a real-world case of health examination institution location selection in Taipei Metropolitan. By integrating fuzzy set theory, factor rating system and simple additive weighting, FSAWS is applied effectively to deal with subjective/objective (qualitative and quantitative) criteria. Especially, the procedure considers the professional experience or authority importance of each decision maker under group decision-making conditions. In this study, the final solution is obtained by identifying the optimal site of health examination institution for further evaluation and negotiation.

Summary form only given. Time-advance algorithms based on Hamilton´s variational principle are being developed for application to problems in plasma physics. The numerical solution of systems of ordinary differential equations via Hamilton´s principle has been addressed in the present work. The basic idea is first to choose a class of functions for approximating the solution of the ordinary differential equations over a specific time interval. Then the parameters in the approximating function are determined by applying Hamilton´s principle exactly within the class of approximating functions. The issue of how to choose time-advance algorithms is very important for achieving efficient, physically meaningful computer simulations. The objective here is to reliably simulate those characteristics of an evolving system which are scientifically most relevant.

Waylan, A. T., O'Quinn, P. R., Goodband, R. D., Unruh, J. A., Nelssen, J. L., Woodworth, J. C. and Tokach, M. D. 2003. Effects of dietary additions of modified tall oil, chromium nicotinate, and L-carnitine on growth performance, carcass characteristics, and bacon characteristics of growing-finishing pigs. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 83:459-467. Eighty gilts were supplemented with modified tall oil (MTO), chromium nicotinate (CrNic), and L-carnitine to determine effects on growth and meat quality characteristics. Pigs were assigned to one of eight treatments in a 2*2*2 factorial with main effects of MTO (0 or 0.5%), CrNic (0 or 50 (mu)g kg^-1), and L-carnitine (0 or 50 mg kg^-1). Pigs fed MTO had increased (P = 0.03) average daily gain and pigs fed CrNic had improved (P = 0.02) gain:feed. Bellies from pigs supplemented with MTO with no CrNic were firmer (P < 0.05) than bellies from all other treatment combinations. No differences (P > 0.05) were detected for longissimus muscle (LM) visual or objective color values. Furthermore, no differences (P > 0.05) were detected for LM Warner-BratzIer shear force or sensory traits. Bacon from pigs fed MTO had firmer (P < 0.05) slices than bacon from pigs fed no MTO. These data suggest improvements in growth performance from addition of 0.50% MTO and(or) 50 (mu)g kg^-1 CrNic to diets of finishing gilts. Supplementing with MTO, CrNic, and L-carnitine had minimal effects on carcass, LM color and sensory, or bacon characteristics.

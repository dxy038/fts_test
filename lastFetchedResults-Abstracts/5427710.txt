On 31 October 1996, BT began installation of a new public interactive networked multimedia touch screen kiosk, branded Touchpoint. When the pilot formally begins shortly (1997), there will be around 200 kiosks in and around London, offering a unique range of information, promotional and transactions services. The objective of the pilot is to assess the technical, operational and commercial issues associated with the platform prior to the implementation of a roll out. The paper presents a top level description of the Touchpoint product and its architecture, and positions kiosks within the context of a comprehensive multimedia strategy and product portfolio. It also highlights a number of the key issues which have had to be addressed during the project so far

Firstly, the paper uses horizontal double decomposition and resource parameter decomposition to decompose the large scale with trapezoidal structure multi-objective programming model; then the resources decomposition influence of deviation variables and the relationship of the optimal solutions have been discussed; finally the relationship between the optimal solutions of horizontal decomposition problem have been proved.

The use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to solve problems with multiple objectives (known as multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs)) has attracted much attention. Being population based approaches, EAs offer a means to find a group of Pareto-optimal solutions in a single run. Differential evolution (DE) is an EA that was developed to handle optimization problems over continuous domains. The objective of this paper is to introduce a novel Pareto-frontier differential evolution (PDE) algorithm to solve MOPs. The solutions provided by the proposed algorithm for two standard test problems, outperform the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm, one of the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms for solving MOPs

Objective: To examine the differences in realization of expected benefits, complications, and quality of life (QOL) 3 months after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Design: Nonexperimental, prospective, and comparative. Before discharge, participants listed benefits expected from the procedure, as well as comorbid health problems (Charlson Comorbidity Index) and complications. At 3 months, they quantified their realization of expected benefits, reported postdischarge complications, and completed Ferrans and Powers’ Quality of Life Index—Cardiac Version III. Sample: 36 patients who had PTCA; 38 patients who had CABG. Results: There were no differences between groups in realization of expected benefits or QOL. Patients who had CABG reported a greater number of complications after discharge, and a greater proportion of patients who had PTCA reported angina. Patients who had PTCA and then recurrent angina had significantly lower health QOL and psychologic and spiritual QOL. Conclusions: Patients who undergo CABG need guidance regarding what complications to expect, and patients who undergo PTCA need to know that recurrent angina is possible and how to manage it.

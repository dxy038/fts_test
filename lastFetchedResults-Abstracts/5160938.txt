A single-crank-double-rocker mechanism is used to realize the flapping motion of Micro flapping aerial vehicle. However, this vehicle often pitches toward left or right and crashes during flight which mainly caused by the incomplete symmetry of wings movement. To solve this problem, mathematical models of the flapping angle and angular velocity of two wings are established, respectively. An optimal design based on the objective function is carried out under some mechanics, bionics and aerodynamics restraint condition. To verify the mathematical model, then, the mechanism is also analyzed in ADAMS environment. The results indicate that the optimization can remarkably improve the symmetry of flapping wings movement.

The provinces of I.R. of Iran have attained different levels of eco-nomical and social development in the past years. The main objective of this study is to use data envelopment analysis to examine the com-parative performance of provinces in I.R. of Iran. We applied an out-put-oriented DEA model based on data for three inputs (crimes ratio, unemployment percent and illiteracy) and three outputs (GDP, life ex-pectancy and employment). The findings based on 1383 data show that 9 out of 28 provinces are efficient. For each inefficient province, DEA identifies the sources and the level of inefficiency for each input and output. The efficient provinces are ranked using cross efficiency matrix and an output–oriented version of Andersen – Petersen's DEA model and the results are analyzed and compared. The results reveal that Tehran province, Esfahan province and Busher province have the highest rank.

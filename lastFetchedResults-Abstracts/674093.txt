Evaluation of textbooks is one of the three stages of curriculum design: (1) planning, (2) implementation, and evaluation. One objective of the third phase is the evaluation of instructional packages and materials. Evaluation is divided into internal and external types. The aim of this study is the internal evaluation of the textbook “Sadalhayat” (intermediate level) in terms of the compatibility of its 12 activity types with seven principles of communicative language teaching: (1) information transfer principle, (2) information gap principle, (3) principle of task dependency, (4) principle of instructing language functions, (5) principle of language use at the discourse level, (6) principle of teaching language learning strategies, and (7) principle of learners’ interactions. The results of the textbook analysis clearly show that the activities in the textbook are not compatible with these principles, and that lesson plans and organization of activities do not fall within communicative language teaching as a dominant approach over the last two decades. Therefore, the activities in the textbook need great modification to create a communicative context and to achieve the final goal which is the development of communicative competence among Arabic learners. However, this shows the deficiency of this textbook only from the perspective of communicative language teaching principles. In case other teaching approaches and principles were the basis for the development of the textbook, the incompatibility of the textbook activities with these principles is not considered a shortcoming and only shows that these principles did not function as the cornerstone of the textbook.

Objective: To define the frequency of exclusive electrophysiological motor involvement in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
Methods: We reviewed the electrophysiological studies of 2727 consecutive hands with typical symptoms and signs of CTS and at least one abnormal test of the following: median distal motor latency (DML), digit two sensory conduction velocity (D2-SCV), segmental D2-SCV from wrist to palm, median-ulnar sensory latency difference from ring finger stimulation.
Results: Thirty-one hands (1.2%) had prolonged median DML (>4.4 ms) with normal SCV (>48 m/s). In 17 of 31 hands, segmental D2-SCV from wrist to palm or median-ulnar latency difference from ring finger stimulation were also performed with normal results in 8 hands, demonstrating a true exclusive electrophysiological motor involvement.
Conclusions: In CTS, exclusive electrophysiological involvement of median motor fibers is rare. It may be related to preferential compression of the intraneural motor fascicles clumped superficially in the most volar-radial nerve quadrant or, more probably, to the fact that the recurrent thenar branch may exit the carpal tunnel through a separate ligamentous tunnel within the transverse carpal ligament where it may be preferentially or selectively compressed.

The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate the static headspace in combination with GC equipped with electrolytic conductivity detector (ELCD) for the analysis of trihalomethanes (THMs) in drinking water. The effects of experimental parameters such as water temperature, ionic strength of solution, agitation time and sample volume on the system performance were investigated. The quantification was based on the internal standard 1-chloro-2-bromopropane. The response for all THMs was linear in the concentration range of 0.5 to 40 ?g/l. The limits of detection (LOD) are 0.09, 0.13, 0.21 and 0.34 ?g/l for chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane and bromoform, respectively. The relative standard deviations for analysis were less than 4.8%. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of THMs in spiked drinking water and well water samples.

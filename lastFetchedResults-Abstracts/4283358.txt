The objective of this paper show perturbation of active islanding detection techniques in power system network on Matlab/Simulink, voltage shift islanding detection technique represents active islanding detection techniques. Simulation results on Matlab/Simulink show that voltage shift of active islanding detection technique has detect the island fast and it has not nondetection zone. But, it perturbed the system every time which the control system of inverter injected a signal of voltage shift to check that occurrence condition is islanding condition or not. Similarly, active islanding detection techniques have perturbed the power system network to check occurrence condition.

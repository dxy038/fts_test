Workers who carry out manual rebar tying tasks are exposed to muscular-skeletal injuries associated with the use of manual tools and the movements associated with them (force, repetitiveness and awkward wrist postures). This paper presents a background on musculoskeletal injuries directly linked to manual and mechanical rebar tying method is conducted. 
The objective of this study is to compare the traditional manual rebar tying method to the innovative mechanical technique. The methodology carried out follows a qualitative and a quantitative analysis of both processes. Firstly, a qualitative analysis is performed by semi-structured interviews to workers. Secondly, a quantitative study is carried out in the region of Andalusia (Spain). This field study includes on-site measurements of lengths of time activities. According to the methodology developed by the International Labour Organization, the work timing is calculated and a comparison is given. 
Results state that the operators adapt without difficulty to the mechanical method and it could result in better performance, whilst reducing some of the risks deriving from the manual tying technique.

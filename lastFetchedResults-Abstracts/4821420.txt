The choice of a set of capacitors for a DC link may be very different depending on the system requirements and constraints. This paper shows how to optimize a hybrid association of electrolytic capacitor and higher frequency technology (polyester for instance). Maximum allowed rms current in the electrolytic capacitor is obviously taken into account. The input filter of a buck converter is chosen as example. Various constraints are considered: voltage ripple, differential mode EMI level, losses, weight, volume, surface... objective function for optimization is defined by the user and may be any of the previous parameters. The optimization result consists in the number and the values of components for both capacitor technologies.

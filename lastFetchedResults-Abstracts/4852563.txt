The only power source of nodes in sensor networks is usually provided by batteries which have a determined lifetime. In order to increase the total network lifetime, neighbors nodes can alternate between active (receive, transmit...) and sleep mode. The objective is to find sets of active nodes that ensure as much as possible the zone coverage. In this paper, we will introduce a new method for nodes scheduling in sensor networks. We exploit a mobile beacon localization approach to construct sets of active nodes. The mobile beacon follows the Hilbert space filling curve, that has several properties. It divides the area into unit squares by the mean of linear ordering. In our approach, we chose the Hilbert curve order, in a way that, every unit square will be covered by one and only one sensor node and all the reminder nodes inside this unit square will go to sleep until the first node dies. It is an energy saved approach because nodes communicate only with the mobile beacon. The experimental studies we conducted, confirmed the effectiveness of our approach

Our objective was to assess strain in common carotid artery (CCA) plaques using a previously validated speckle tracking algorithm. Radial and longitudinal strain was measured in 7 patients (77 &#177; 6 years) with carotid atherosclerosis and was compared with a quantitative visual assessment grading of plaques on the Gray-Weale scale by two experienced physicians. A greater pulse-pressure adjusted radial and longitudinal strain was found in echolucent plaques compared to echogenic plaques. This study shows the feasibility of ultrasound speckle tracking strain estimation in plaques and indicates the possibility to characterize plaques using speckle tracking strain in vivo.

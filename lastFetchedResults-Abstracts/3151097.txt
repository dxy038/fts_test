The objective of this paper is to describe a method of current measurement by using sensor without magnetic core based on the principle of Hall sensor. This method doesnÂ´t use any robust ferrite magnetic field concentrators. The measurement system is protected towards the external disturbances by signal processing. The field sensors are connected directly to the DSP board. This current measurement system is designed for measuring in the field of power electronic devices. Therefore it must fulfil the requirements for galvanic isolation, DC and AC current sensing, high frequency bandwidth (more than 30 kHz), overloading and high electromagnetic disturbance immunity. The outputs of sensors are computed by the DSP algorithms. The expansion interface of all peripheral circuits was designed and proved. The standard evaluation kit with TMS320F2812 made by Texas Instruments is used.

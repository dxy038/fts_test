The economic and environmental dispatch problem is formulated as a Non-linear constrained multi-objective problem with competing and non-commensurable objectives of fuel cost and emission. This paper presents a new multi-objective differential evolution algorithm. Initially, a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm is employed to obtain a set of pareto solutions followed by Multi-objective differential evolution algorithm and its corresponding set of pareto solution. The proposed algorithm has been tested on a forty unit test system to illustrate the analysis. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed Multi-objective differential evolution technique to generate the set of well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions and also reflects its superiority in terms of diversity of the pareto-optimal set. The simulation results obtained from the proposed approach are compared with the NSGA-II method.

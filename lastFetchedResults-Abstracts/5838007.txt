A typical model for problems involving sequential decision processes in a discrete-time setting is considered. Several means to improve the regular dynamic programming method for solving the model problem are proposed. Reducing the sizes of the state and control domains is the key objective for improving efficiency. Theoretical justification of the domain reduction idea is provided

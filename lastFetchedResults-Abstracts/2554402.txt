<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Background:</span></strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world with considerably higher frequency among men than women. Treatment of the disease is possible according to early diagnosis, so identifying useful markers is very important. LSINCT5 (long stress-induced non-coding transcript 5) is a stress-regulated lncRNA involved in response to oxidative stress, also in cell proliferation and cancer development, especially in the presence of tobacco carcinogens.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Objective:</span></strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> in this study, we aimed to evaluate the influence of LSINCT5 gene polymorphism with the susceptibility of bladder cancer among a group of patients from south of Iran. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Methods: </span></strong><span style="font-size: medium;">100 patients with bladder cancer and 100 healthy subjects as control group were investigated in this case-control study.</span><strong></strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Genotyping of the </span><span style="font-size: medium;">rs2935641 polymorphism was carried out using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) approach. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Results: </span></strong><span style="font-size: medium;">It was found that the single base substitution C to T at the coding region of the LSINCT5 was not significantly associated with bladder cancer. Genotype and allele frequencies distributed evenly among cases and controls, but no TT genotype was seen. History of smoking was significantly higher in bladder cancer patients compared to controls (p&lt;0.001). </span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Conclusion: </span></strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Results showed that the LSINCT5 polymorphism was not a key factor in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer. Tobacco smoking is one of the strongest risk </span><span style="font-size: medium;">factors</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> for bladder cancer. </span></span></p>

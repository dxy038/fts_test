Background: Smoking has negative effects on reproductive process. Exposing to
cigarette smoking (passive smoking) may exert some effects as the direct smoking.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between ovarian
response and passive smoking in women who underwent ART cycles.
Materials and Methods: One hundred-sixty patients who underwent ICSI between
2000 and 2001 were studied in a prospective cohort study. The case group included
women whose husbands smoked at least 5 cigarettes daily for I year or more. The
control group included women with nonsmoking husbands. Women with high FSH
level (> 12 IU/ml) were excluded. Long standard protocol with GnRH agonist and HMG
were used in all patients. In vitro fertilization and embryo transfer was carried out in a
standard fashion.
Results: Eighty one women were in case group and 82 in control group. Ovarian
response variables were not significantly different between two groups but there was a
significant relation between passive smoking and fertilization (RR= 1.18,95% CI: 1.071.31).
However pregnancy rate was not significantly different between two groups.
Moreover there were no significant differences between heavy and light smokers in
ovarian response outcomes.
Conclusion: This study showed no correlation between ovarian response parameters
and passive smoking in women underwent ART cycles, whereas fertilization rate is
significantly lower in this group compared to control group. It may be related to sperm
quality than oocytes. Assessment of nicotin in follicular fluid and cytogenetic evaluation
of embryo before transfer are recommended for more information and confirmation.

This paper presents a multi-objective algorithm for determining a restoration plan for radial distribution network supply. The proposed algorithm is based on the concept of a local network and the multi-solution reconfiguration algorithm. The introduction of the local network concept reduces the dimension of the problem, while the multi-solution reconfiguration algorithm, based on the decision tree, efficiently selects a specified number of “high quality” variants of alternate supply. All these variants are then ranked according to specified criteria. The final output of the algorithm is presented in the form of a ranking list of alternate supply variants and switching operation plans for their performance. The test results from a real-life distribution network have shown that the multi-objective algorithm is an efficient and robust tool for solving large scale operation problems in real time

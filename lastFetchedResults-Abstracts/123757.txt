BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bone marrow is a specific tissue, which is very important for Haemopoesis. Any changes in its physiological function, such as aplastic anemia, attack of infectious agents and tumors of bone marrow due to wide systemic side effects in body. Denervation is one of the factors that may effect on the function of bone marrow.
METHODS: Femoral and sciatic nerve of right leg were cut in the below of inguinal ligament and near of sciatic notch, respectively. Two, eight and twelve weeks after denervation, bone marrow of right tibial bone were aspirated in all groups. Then quality and quantity of bone marrow changes, size and counter of its cells were studied by three stains (Toluidine blue, Masson trichrom and H&E) and Morphometric method.
FINDINGS: After 2 weeks of denervation, condense of nucleus of cells and blood circulation of bone marrow increased. Size and cell numbers decreased and from 8th week decline of metochromasy and increase of collagen in the bone marrow were seen which was a sign of fibrilation in background tissue.
CONCLUSION: Condense of nucleus and decrease of size and cell numbers could be result of decline of their function due to their denervation. After denervation and change of cell methabolism, turn over of tissue was disordered in which showed by decline in size and number of cells.

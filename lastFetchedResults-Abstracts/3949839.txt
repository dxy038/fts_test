In the paper, analytic spatial electric load forecasting methods are classified into two approaches: trending and multivariate. Trending approaches extrapolate load based on past values of load data. Multivariate techniques either extrapolate or simulate load based on annual small area peak load as well as other variables. Each approach is further divided into two classes. The objective of the paper is to present a comprehensive review of some of the existing methods that describe the general concept of an analytic spatial load forecast, as well as the notable merits and deficiencies associated with the various available techniques.

Background and Objective: According to physical disability progression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), little data about concurrent training effectiveness with therapeutically aid approach, this study was designed to investigate the effect of concurrent aerobicresistance training for eightweeks on aerobic power and functional capacity in young female patients with Multiple Sclerosis.

Materials and Methods: 47 female patients with MS were randomly assigned to an experimental group
(27 subjects  28.74 plusmn  3.07 yrs.  BMI of 31.9 plusmn  4.32 kg/m2  degree of disability (14) and a control group
(20 subjects  28.20 plusmn  4.11 yrs.  BMI of 30.43 plusmn  4.57 kg/m2  degree of disability (14). The subjects were assessed in the pretest and posttest using 10 and 500m walking speed, balance, fatigue, and aerobic power tests. In addition to taking the prescribed medications, the experimental group participated in an 8week concurrent training program (3 sessions per week including 10 min warmup, 15 min aerobic exercise at 6075% maximum heart rate, 25 min weight training exercises at 10repetition maximum (10RM) and 5 min cooldown). The control group only took the prescribed medications. To analyze the collected data, Ttests for dependent and independent sles were used.

Results: The results indicated significant improvement in fatigue, balance, and walking speed of the experimental group (Plt 0.05), but there were no significant changes in their aerobic power.

Conclusion: The results suggest that concurrent training exercises such as aerobicresistance program can improve walking speed, balance, and fatigue in women with multiple sclerosis. Therefore, such training exercises are recommended for movement and functional status of these patients.

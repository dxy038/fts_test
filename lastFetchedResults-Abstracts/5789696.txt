The proposed automated system enables simultaneously considering the multi-objective effect to forecast or generate a floor plan design for an embedded passive multilayer substrate for RF application. The auto-generated floor plan design for multilayer substrate is demonstrated to have the capability to meet the custom request multi-objective criterion based on the initial userÂ´s define weighting factor.

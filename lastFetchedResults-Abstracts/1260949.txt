Objective To investigate the operative impact and therapeutic value of window partial laryngectomy for the treatment of stage T2-3 glottic laryngeal carcinoma. Methods From October 2000 to December 2006, window partial laryngectomy and laryngeal reconstruction were performed on 48 appropriately selected patients with stage T2-3 glottic laryngeal carcinomas. Twenty-nine males and 19 females were included. Before the operation and in the sixth month after the operation, degree of hoarseness, vocal fold mobility and symmetry, glottal width during quiet breathing, degree of glottal closure during phonating, respiratory function, and swallowing function were surveyed. In addition, tumor recurrence and metastasis and patient survival time were monitored. Results With the exception of vocal fold mobility (Pآ =آ 0.343), there were significant differences between the two treatment groups in all areas that were investigated, including degree of hoarseness (all Pآ <آ 0.01), vocal fold symmetry (Pآ =آ 0.000), glottal width during quiet breathing (Pآ =آ 0.001), degree of glottal closure during phonating (Pآ =آ 0.001), and respiratory function (Pآ =آ 0.001). Swallowing function was not influenced (Pآ =آ 0.310). There was recurrence in one case (2.1%), cervical lymph node metastasis in one case, and hepatic metastasis in one case. The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 96.9% and 88.9%, respectively. Conclusions This study showed that window partial laryngectomy was successful for treating properly selected stage T2-3 glottic laryngeal carcinoma. This operation was effective for reducing surgical invasion and facilitated the resumption of respiratory and vocal function.

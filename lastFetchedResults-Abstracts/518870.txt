Objective- This study was performed to evaluate the early results of stent implantation for aortic coarctation or recoaratation. Methods- 19 patients with a mean age of 21پ}12 years with aortic coarctation, 14 native and 5 recoarctations, were treated by stenting in our center over a period of two years. The mean peak systolic pressure gradient across the coarcted segment was 54 mmHg پ} 14 mmHg. Results- The procedure was effective in all 19 cases. Immediately after stent implantation the mean peak systolic gradient fell to 6پ}4 mmHg (P< 0.001). Complications occurred in 2 patients (stent migration in 1, edge dissection in another patient). Conclusion- Stent implantation for aortic coarctation and native coarctation gives good immediate results. Non-invasive studies including spiral CT scan and echocardiographic study is recommended for follow-up after stent implantation in order to evaluate long-term results (Iranian Heart Journal 2006; 7 (3):5-8).

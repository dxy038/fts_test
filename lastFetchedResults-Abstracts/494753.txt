BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Physical inactivity causes around 2 million deaths in the world each year. It is estimated to cause about 10-16% of cases each of breast cancer, colon cancers, and diabetes, and about 22% of ischaemic heart disease. This study is carried out based on determination of the effect of educational intervention through the theory of planned behavior on the physical activities of Kerman Health Center's staff. METHODS: This is a before and after quasi experimental research. This study was performed on 149 persons of Kerman province and city health Center's staff in two groups of intervention and control. Through a questionnaire provided by the researcher, the elements of this theory were measured before and after intervention. The educational intervention was used in intervention group based on intervention according to this theory for 6 weeks and for control group just lecture was used. Then two groups were evaluated.

FINDINGS: Both groups don't have any significant difference before intervention based on demographic characteristics. Before intervention there was no meaningful difference between the averages of the grades of the theory's different elements in two groups (p>0.05). After intervention there was a meaningful increase in the average of awareness and behavioral intention of intervention group's grades and there was a meaningful increase in the average of behavioral intention of control group's grades (p<0.05). In mean difference of grades constructs of theory didn't have revealed any significant difference between groups of intervention and control before and after intervention.

CONCLUSION: The results showed that the 6 week implementation of theory of planned behavior base and lecture base has shown no significant effect on the physical activities of Kerman health Center's staff.

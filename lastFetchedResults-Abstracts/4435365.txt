In recent years, many researchers have studied the changes in bone mass and biomechanical competence in relation to age and sex hormones due to the increase awareness of osteoporosis in the elderly. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of ovariectomization and aging on the cortical bone of the rat femur concentrating on the biomechanical properties and bone mass. The fluoride treatment technique was employed to understand the relationship between the biomechanical properties and the interfacial interactions between the mineral-organic interface of the cortical bone

GIC will threaten safety and stable operation of power systems, but installing the management devices of GIC in a substation can not solve the problem of GIC fundamentally. Therefore, the article studied GIC model. Taking the grounding currents of all substations of whole power network not to exceed as objective: the article optimized governance program using the sensitivity analysis method and verified the effectiveness and feasibility of the optimization measure by giving the results of Heilongjiang 500kV planning power grid in late 2011.

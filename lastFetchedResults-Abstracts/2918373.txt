Describes a novel Hardware/Software design and implementation for an entirely digital permanent magnet AC Brushless Control system based on a single Texas Instruments TMS 320 C25 microprocessor. The main objective of the work is to explore a purely digital implementation with a single microprocessor solution and the associated signal processing requirements for such an implementation

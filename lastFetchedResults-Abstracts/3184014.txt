Solar integrated current-fed quasi-Z-source inverter (qZSI) have been proposed to overcome the limitations of current-source inverter (CSI) and current-fed Z (impedance) source inverter (ZSI). The problems with CSI are unidirectional power flow and can perform only voltage boost operation. On the other hand ZSI is bidirectional with an additional diode and have voltage buck-boost capability. The techniques of ZSI and qZSI are more or less the same but qZSIs are considered to be more efficient and reliable. The drawback of ZSI is that the inductors must sustain high currents. Space vector pulse-width modulation is analyzed in this paper; here the power buck-boost capability is attained by changing the values of input inductance. Simulation results are shown.

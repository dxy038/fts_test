Computer has revolutionalised the ways businesses are conducted across the globe and brought about the business to business (B2B) e-commerce revolution, which accelerated the process of globalisation. B2B e-commerce has been adopted in the Europe (EU), United States of America (USA), India, New Zealand and South Africa (SA) to enhance business registration and promotions. However, this development is not yet applicable in Congo-Brazzaville. However, owing to the nature of Congolese immigrants' small micro and medium-sized enterprises (SMMEs) in Cape Town, online business registration is necessary to enable them to save in respect of supply chain management costs and contributions to the country's economic reconstruction process. Hence, the Centre for Business and Administrative Procedures (CFBAP): Centre des Formalites Administratives des Entreprises (CFE), should consider the B2B e-commerce website as an important objective. At a national level, e-commerce website adoption at CFBAP will leverage the country's standards of conducting business, as well as stimulate Congolese immigrant entrepreneurs in Cape Town to invest in Congo-Brazzaville.

Evaluating the implemented sprinkler irrigation systems, made it possible to determine these systems level of success; and presented practical solutions to improve the efficiency of these systems and offered suggestions for future systems. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the status and performance of the implemented center pivot systems in the study area. In this study, 5 center pivots were chosen in alfalfa, maize and sugar beet fields in Moghan AgroIndustry and Livestock. Each system was evaluated in 3 experiments. The results showed that, average distribution coefficient, distribution uniformity, PELQ, AEQL, evaporation and wind drift losses are about 47.5, 60.4, 50.1, 50.1 and 7.6, respectively. Analyses of these evaluation parameters showed that the existing center pivot systems in the study fields were not efficient. The Low efficiency of these systems was results of improper management and technical issues that were not considered. The reason for the low amount of AELQ and PELQ was improper designing and operation of these systems that should be considered and revised.

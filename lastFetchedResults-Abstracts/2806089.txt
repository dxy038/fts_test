In Smart Grid, the smart meters are versatile role with intelligent capabilities in order to meet the consumerÂ´s demands and their each objective. Smart meter can measure and communicate detailed real time electricity usage, facilitate remote real time monitoring and control power consumptions and consumers are provided with real time pricing and analyzed usage information, which is a technical data to be transmitted to the grid, who are utility providers. More detailed feedback on each appliance to the user. In this connection Demand-side management (DSM) programs implemented by utility companies to control the energy consumption in residences appliances which are interfacing the digital meter with many DSM technical properties and Home energy management system is also implemented for the same cause. A simulation framework that can model a house equipped with various home appliances and the simulator can predict the power dissipation profiles of individual appliances as well as the cumulative energy consumption of the house in a realistic manner, in this process the harmonic pollutions in the electrical networks became one of the major factors affecting the power quality of the network which are detected and for which one of the techniques is two stage solutions for the harmonic analysis by Radial basis function in the neural network. Future smart grids will likely to be more tightly integrated with the cyber infrastructure for sensing, control, scheduling, dispatch, billing and cyber attacks can be detected by using smart meters and also ordering the power demand through online.

A Honey Bee Mating Optimization (HBMO)
algorithm is proposed to tune optimal gains of a
Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller for Load
Frequency Control (LFC) design in an interconnected
power system in this paper. The problem of robustly
tuning of PID based LFC design is formulated as an
optimization problem according to the time domain-based
objective function which is solved by the HBMO
technique that has a strong ability to find the most
optimistic results. To ensure performance and robustness
of the proposed control strategy to stabilize frequency
oscillations, the design process takes a wide range of
operating conditions and system nonlinearities into
account. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method a two-area interconnected power
system is considered as a test system under different
operating conditions. The simulation results are shown to
maintain robust performance in comparison with the
particle swarm optimization based tuned PID controller
and classical controllers through ITAE performance
indices. Results evaluation show that the proposed
control strategy achieves good robust performance for
wide range of system parameters and load changes in the
presence of system nonlinearities and is superior to the
other controllers. Moreover, the proposed control strategy
has simple structure, easy to implement and tune which
can be useful for the real world complex power system.

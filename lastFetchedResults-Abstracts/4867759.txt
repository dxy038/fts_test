This paper presents a mathematical model for dynamic decision making with an objective function induced from fuzzy preferences. The fuzzy preference is related to decision making in artificial intelligence, and this paper models human behaviour based on his/her aggregated fuzzy preferences. To deal with fuzzy preferences in dynamic decision making brings us difficulty which is different from static one since the value criterion of fuzzy preferences in dynamic behavior transforms together with time and it is formulated gradually. A reasonable criterion based on fuzzy preferences is formulated for the dynamic decision making, and an optimality equation for this model is derived by dynamic programming. Mathematical models simulating human behavior with his/her decision making are applicable to various fields: robotics, customersÂ´ behavior analysis in marketing, linguistic learning modeling, multi-agent systems and so on.

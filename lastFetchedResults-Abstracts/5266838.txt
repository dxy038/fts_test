The shortest path problem is one of the most fundamental problems applicable in various fields, and has close relation to route navigation systems. This paper surveys algorithms for the two-terminal shortest path problem and proposes bidirectional A* algorithm based on a new approach. This algorithm is suitable for finding not only the shortest route but also better routes. The efficiency and the property of these algorithms are discussed through experiments applying them to an actual road network

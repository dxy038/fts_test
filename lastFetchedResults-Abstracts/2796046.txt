The main goal of LTE system is to provide high data transfer rate, low latency, increased flexible and effective bandwidth, and improve quality of service to reduce delay. In this paper, we develop radio admission control mechanism for handling multiclass services in LTE systems. An objective function of maximizing the number of admitted users is proposed to evaluate the system capacity. To solve the optimization problem, we present a combined complete sharing and virtual partitioning resource allocation model and develop a service degradation scheme in case of resource limitations in the radio admission control mechanism. The system performance parameters of interest are evaluated by using Markov chain model. Numerical results show that an optimal proportion of resource deployment for different service groups can be identified to maximize system capacity while at the same time maintaining quality of service constraints of all admitted users.

A linearization method to design biorthogonal cosine modulation (BCM ) filter banks is proposed. In our proposed method, both the objective function and the perfect reconstruction condition are expressed as the quadratic function of the prototype filter coefficients. By using the Lagrange multiplier approach, the design procedure is formulated as solving the linear equation iteratively to obtain the desirable prototype filter. The main advantages of the proposed method are simple design procedure and computational efficiency. A design example is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm

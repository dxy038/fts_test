This paper deals with topology sti ness optimization of a ground structure consisting of rectangular
2D-beam elements with path-dependent response. The objective of the optimization is to minimize the
compliance of the structure when the mass is prescribed. The path-dependent response of the structure is
due to the plastic hinges at the ends of the beam elements. The plastic hinges are modelled through yield
surfaces giving the interaction between the stress resultants when the cross-section is fully plasti ed. In
combination with the yield surface a simple hardening rule is applied. The geometrically non-linearities
are also included, so the beam elements can perform large rigid body rotations. The  nite element
solution is obtained with an implicit backward Euler algorithm. From the  nite element solution the
analytical sensitivities are computed using the direct method

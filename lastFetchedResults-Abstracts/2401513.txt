Object-oriented Petri Net modeling of coal supply chain system can be established from the perspective of workflow by applying the technology of object-orientation and Petri net. On the basis of the modeling, profit maximization optimization for the selection of resources and the environment in a certain condition to meet customer demand is taken as the coal supply chain optimization objective. And under the quantitative description and analysis of the internal nodes, logistics, capital flow and information flow in coal supply chain system, the optimal method is used for objective optimization. Through this research, we have learned that the use of the method in coal supply chain modeling and objective optimization can accurately reflect the operation of the coal supply chain and its resource constraints, which will finally improve decision-making performance. The complex systems can be highly abstracted by using this OPN model which is also easy for expansion and optimization model has a strong versatility.

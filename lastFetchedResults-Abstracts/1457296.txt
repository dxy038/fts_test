Biological wastewater treatment is a complex, multivariate process, in which a number of physical and biological processes occur simultaneously. In this study, principal component analysis (PCA) and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) were used to profile and characterise Lagoon 115E, a multistage biological lagoon treatment system at Melbourne Water's Western Treatment Plant (WTP) in Melbourne, Australia. In this study, the objective was to increase our understanding of the multivariate processes taking place in the lagoon. The data used in the study span a 7-year period during which samples were collected as often as weekly from the ponds of Lagoon 115E and subjected to analysis. The resulting database, involving 19 chemical and physical variables, was studied using the multivariate data analysis methods PCA and PARAFAC. With these methods, alterations in the state of the wastewater due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors could be discerned. The methods were effective in illustrating and visually representing the complex purification stages and cyclic changes occurring along the lagoon system. The two methods proved complementary, with each having its own beneficial features.

The author describes a secure data communication method based on the CSMA/CD protocol in bidirectional star networks. A procedure for detecting packet collision while transmitting the jamming signal is required. The author assess two kinds of protocol, a CRV (code rule violation) protocol and a DR (delayed replying) protocol

The quantitative understanding of customer knowledge value is particularly important. According to the fuzziness and dynamic characteristics of customer knowledge, this paper puts forward a way of customer knowledge value evaluation based on dynamic fuzzy (DF) sets. In the process of evaluation, we constructed the membership functions according to the characteristics of knowledge growth, which can make evaluation result to be more objective and accurate. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and availability of the method by a sample. This method not only can be used to calculate the size of the customer knowledge value, but also can reflect the dynamic development trend. Furthermore, it can be the reference standard for enterprise to effectively identify customer knowledge source.

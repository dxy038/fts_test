ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Breast milk includes standard immune and nutritional component for infants. WHO recommended exclusive breastfeeding for all infants throughout the world for first six months of life. The aim of this study was to determine the time of first breastfeeding initiation after birth on rate of exclusive breastfeeding.
METHODS: This cohort study was conducted on neonates born in a baby friendly hospital initiative (Babolclinic hospital, Babol, Iran). Infants divided into three groups regarding to initiation of first breastfeeding at the first 60 minutes (group 1), after 60 minutes up to 24 hours (group 2) and after 24 hour of life (group 3). All infants were followed at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of life. Then the rate of exclusive breastfeeding was compared together.
FINDINGS: From 1869 neonates, 965 (51.6%) were boy and 904 (48.4%) were girl. Initiation of first breastfeeding in 734 (39.2%) was in first 60 minutes of life (groups 1), 1014 (54.2%) after 60 minutes up to 24 hours of life (group 2) and 121 (6.6%) after 24 hours (group 3). Survival analysis showed that mean exclusive breastfeeding in group 1 was 5.5 months (CI %95= 5.40-5.63), in group 2 was 5.43 months (CI %95=5.33-5.53) and in group 3 was 2.69 months (CI %95= 2.17-3.2) (p=0.000). Duration of lactation at 12 months of life in three groups was 11.51, 11.45 and 9.6 months respectively and at 24 months of life was 78%, 75% and 58%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results show that initiation of breastfeeding within first 60 minutes after birth is more effective in the exclusive breastfeeding rate so we recommend all maternity units must perform program for initiation of breastfeeding at the first hour of life.

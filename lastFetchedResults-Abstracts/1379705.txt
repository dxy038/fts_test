In this paper, we develop a new non-ordinary state-based peridynamic method to solve transient dynamic solid mechanics problems. This new peridynamic method has advantages over the previously developed bond-based and ordinary state-based peridynamic methods in that its bonds are not restricted to central forces, nor is it restricted to a Poissonâ€™s ratio of 1/4 as with the bond-based method. First, we obtain non-local nodal deformation gradients that are used to define nodal strain tensors. The deformation gradient tensors are used with the nodal strain tensors to obtain rate of deformation tensors in the deformed configuration. The polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensors are then used to obtain the nodal rotation tensors which are used to rotate the rate of deformation tensors and previous Cauchy stress tensors into an unrotated configuration. These are then used with conventional Cauchy stress constitutive models in the unrotated state where the unrotated Cauchy stress rate is objective. We then obtain the unrotated Cauchy nodal stress tensors and rotate them back into the deformed configuration where they are used to define the forces in the nodal connecting bonds. As a first example we quasi-statically stretch a bar, hold it, and then rotate it ninety degrees to illustrate the methods finite rotation capabilities. Next, we verify our new method by comparing small strain results from a bar fixed at one end and subjected to an initial velocity gradient with results obtained from the corresponding one-dimensional small strain analytical solution. As a last example, we show the fracture capabilities of the method using both a notched and un-notched bar.

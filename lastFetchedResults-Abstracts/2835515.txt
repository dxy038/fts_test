The main objective of this study was to identify alternative source of good quality fine aggregates which is depleting very fast due to the fast pace of construction activities in India. Use of slag sand is a waste material of copper production and fly ash is a waste material of power plants provides great opportunity to utilize it as an alternative to normally available aggregates and cement. For this research work, M35 grade concrete was used and tests were conducted for various proportions of copper slag replacement with sand of 0 to 100% and fly ash replacement with cement of 0 to 30<sup>%</sup>. The fine aggregate was replaced with copper slag as proportions of 0<sup>%</sup>, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 80%, and 100% and cement was replaced with fly ash as proportions of 30% in OPC 53 grade cement. Concrete mixtures are evaluated for workability, Ultrasonic pulse velocity test and water absorption test. The obtained result was compared with those of control concrete made with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC).

An electronic circuit model of signal propagation in the nerve axon that is based on the neuristor proposed by H.D. Crane (1960) is described. This circuit is a cascade of identical active network segments suitable for integration. The active line has characteristics such as threshold, a refractory period, saltatory propagation, and bidirectional propagation. These properties are similar to those of signal transmission along a nerve axon. There two modes of interconnection of the active line: T and S junctions. Particularly with the S junction, it is possible to materialize bidirectional junctions, one of which has the function of presynaptic inhibition. This model would be useful as an element of digital systems and as an artificial nerve axon.

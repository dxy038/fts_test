The objective of this work is to use artificial neural networks (ANNs) for heat transfer analysis in corrugated channels. A data set evaluated experimentally is prepared for processing with the use of neural networks. Back propagation algorithm, the most common learning method for ANNs, was used in training and testing the network. To solve this algorithm a computer program using C++ has been developed. The accuracy between experimental and ANNs approach results was achieved with a mean absolute relative error less than 4%.

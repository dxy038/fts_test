Background and Objective: Fish consumption plays an important role in human
health and prevention of disease. This study was aimed to determine the
tendency to fish consumption based on the constructs of the Transtheoretical
Model (TTM) in women referred to Health Centers of Bandar Abbas.
Materials and methods: In this analytical-descriptive study, 383 women who
referred to Health Centers of Bandar Abbas recruited through cluster sampling.
Data were collected using a questionnaire which consisted of two sections,
namely, demographic characteristics and structures of TTM. Data were analyzed
by SPSS 19 and one-way ANOVA and linear trends as statistical tests.
Results: 11.7% of participants were in the precontemplation stage, 3.9% in
the contemplation stage, 13.6% in the preparation stage, 7.3% in the action
stage, and 63.4% in the maintenance stage. The results of the one-way ANOVA
test showed a significant association between constructs of TTM and stages of
change, so that with progress of individuals from pre-contemplation stage to
the maintenance stage, the decisional balance, self-efficacy and processes of
change were increased (p  <  0.05).
Conclusion: Regarding the significant association between decisional balance,
self-efficacy and processes of change with the stages of change for fish consumption,
designing and implementation of educational programs toward reinforcing
the TTM constructs for attaining the action and maintenance in fish
consumption is suggested.

The paper presents the integrated approach of handling system and software engineering issues in an integrated environment with enabling tools, technologies and methods. The proposed Integrated Aircraft Platform (IAP) is used with embedded platform for Simulation, Modeling, Design, Development, Testing, Integration and Certification (SMD2TIC). The basic objective of SMD2TIC is to enable an idea emerged as thought process to produce a product in the same platform using core common resources. An idea is first put into SMD2TIC by a simple low fidelity model using modeling. Then the fidelity of the model is enhanced with iterative design/modeling process. On completing the design by simulation and modeling, the design is then validated on target by porting the code generated from the mode on to the target. SMD2TIC provides a platform for all sub-systems of aircraft like avionics, flight controls, hydraulics, electrical etc. The paper presents in brief, the proposed approach, its components, automation tools, required technologies, adhering standards, certification requirements and data sampling.

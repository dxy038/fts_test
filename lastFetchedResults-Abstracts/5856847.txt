Deals with the design and control of an anthropomorphic autonomous biped robot. The objective is to realize a dynamically stable, three-dimensional walking and jogging motion. The design, sensors and electronics of the robot are introduced. Particular emphasis has been devoted to achieving a high power-to-weight ratio. The corresponding methods for weight reduction are presented. The control scheme is discussed. It is based on the method of feedback linearization employing the equations of motion of the system.

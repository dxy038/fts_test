This paper is based on the studies forming part of the European research project DayWater, which aims at the promotion of stormwater source control (participating countries: UK, France, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands and Greece). Source control techniques include all techniques (e.g. retention, infiltration, reuse) of stormwater treatment near its source, in contrast to end-of-pipe. In this paper we present: the different stormwater management issues across Europe; the specific stormwater management issues in Greece; source control techniques applied in European cities; Public policies for promoting source control techniques; Strategies of application of the aforementioned techniques and policies in Greek cities. In Greece, the question of stormwater treatment has not yet attracted a lot of attention. Wastewater management, flood prevention and fresh water scarcity issues are given priority instead. However source control stormwater management can contribute to the solution of all these problems. In many European cities source control techniques have been chosen for stormwater treatment because: a) they are less expensive than massive end-of-pipe treatment installations, b) they are more compatible with the natural water cycle, c) they reduce the overall stormwater flow and thus permit the expansion of cities without requesting reconstruction of the existing sewer networks. Different policy instruments (taxes, specific regulations and controls, information campaigns) have been applied in order to promote source control techniques. The main objective of this work is to discuss the possibility of applying similar techniques and policies in Greek cities.

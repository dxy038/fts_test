OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the effect of intravenous zidovudine on placental function and fetal well-being.
STUDY DESIGN: Eighteen chronically instrumented third-trimester pregnant baboons and their fetuses were studied after 4- to 48-hour infusions of zidovudine to 14 mothers (0.8 to 2.0 mg/kg/hr) and 6 fetuses (0.2 to 0.22 mg/kg/hr of maternal weight). Fetal and maternal pH and blood gases, hematocrit, blood cell counts, clinical chemistries, electrolytes, and hormones were measured before and after the infusions.
RESULTS: In both mother and fetus no significant differences were found between values in the control periods and those after infusions of zidovudine in any of the index values measured.
CONCLUSION: Administration of zidovudine from 4 to 48 hours in the baboon was associated with no significant change in any biochemical index values in the mother or fetus. Thus comparable exposure of the human fetus to zidovudine during labor is not expected to affect these index values of placental function and fetal well-being.

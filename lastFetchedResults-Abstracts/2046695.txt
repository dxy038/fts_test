Objective: The present study is aimed to investigate in vitro thrombolytic activity of three Bangladeshi medicinal plants Averrhoa bilimbi (Oxalidiaceae), Clerodendrum viscosum (Verbanaceae) and Drynaria quercifolia (Polypodiaceae). Materials and methods: Each the plant was extracted with methanol at room temperature and the concentrated methanolic extracts (MEF) were fractionated by the modified Kupchan partitioning method to render pet-ether soluble fraction (PESF), carbon tetrachloride soluble fraction (CTSF), chloroform soluble fraction (CSF) and aqueous soluble fraction (AQSF). To observe their thrombolytic potential, a prompt and swift method was involved where streptokinase and water were used as positive and negative control, respectively. Result: Among the three plants, AQSF and PESF of D. quercifolia with CTSF of C. viscosum exhibited highest thrombolytic activity by clot lysis of 34.38%, 34.27% and 28.64%, respectively. Among other extracts A. bilimbi, C. viscosun and D.quercifolia showed significant percentage (%) of clot lysis compared to standard streptokinase (41.05%) while the negative control water revealed 3.31 % lysis of clot. Conclusion: From our findings it is observed that all the plants revealed remarkable thrombolytic activity. Therefore, steps should be taken to observe in vivo clot dissolving potential and to isolate active component(s) of these extracts.

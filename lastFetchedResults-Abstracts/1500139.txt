The objective of this paper is to assess the environmental performance of Turkish provinces by using a non-parametric method, Data Envelopment Analysis. The results of ranking are based on the provincesâ€™ ability to produce the largest equi-proportional increase in the desirable output-gross domestic product and decrease in the undesirable output namely, air pollutants. The results indicate that 7.41% of the sample provinces are relatively efficient. The results also show that, regions with the highest level gross domestic product per capita have the highest efficiency scores. New industrial districts have lower efficiencies in spite of relatively higher income per capita. In the second stage of the study the possible relationship between environmental efficiency scores and input, output variables are investigated by a regression analysis. According to the results, there is a positive relationship between gross domestic product and efficiency scores.

Solid particle erosion tests have been conducted on three different alumina-based refractories at elevated temperatures up to 1400 °C, using sharp SiC particles between 325 and 830 μm in diameter. The impact speed is 50 m/s and the impact angle is varied between 30° and 90°. The objective of this study is to ascertain the effects of temperature and impact angle on the erosion resistance of alumina refractories. The experimental results reveal that the alumina-based refractories, in general, exhibit increasing erosion resistance with increasing temperature and decreasing impact angle, with the minimum erosion rate at 1200 °C and 30° impact angle. Chrome corundum refractory brick is the most resistant to vertical erosion, due to its highest alumina content, and associated hardness and density, as well as strongly bonded aggregate and binder phase. The primary material removal mechanisms are fracture and chipping of binder phase and aggregate, as well as aggregate pull-out.

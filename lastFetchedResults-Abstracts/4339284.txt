The main objective of a text summarization system is to identify the most important information from the given text and present it to the end users. In this paper, Wikipedia articles are given as input to system and extractive text summarization is presented by identifying text features and scoring the sentences accordingly. The text is first pre-processed to tokenize the sentences and perform stemming operations. We then score the sentences using the different text features. Two novel approaches implemented are using the citations present in the text and identifying synonyms. These features along with the traditional methods are used to score the sentences. The scores are used to classify the sentence to be in the summary text or not with the help of a neural network. The user can provide what percentage of the original text should be in the summary. It is found that scoring the sentences based on citations gives the best results.

Our objective was to determine the influence of short-term exposure to endophyte-infected tall fescue on reproductive function of ram lambs. Rams (214 days of age) were fed a diet free of endophyte-infected fescue seed (EF; n = 8) or endophyte-infected fescue seed (EI; n = 9; 34% of diet; 4.8 μg g−1 ergovaline) for 6 weeks. Feed offered to EF rams, individually fed, was reduced to the average intake of EI lambs from previous day so that intake was similar between treatments and averaged 2.4% BW (DM basis), leading to daily intake of 33.7 μg ergovaline kg−1 BW for the EI fed lambs. Daily high ambient temperature for the trial ranged between 16 and 26 °C. Respiration rate and rectal temperature were measured at 14:00 daily. Blood was collected for serum concentrations of prolactin (weekly) and testosterone (twice weekly). Body weight and body condition scores (BCS; 1 = thin; 5 = fat) were determined every 14 days. Scrotal circumference, scrotal skin temperature, and semen characteristics were determined weekly. Rams were slaughtered after 6 weeks of feeding. Signs of fescue toxicosis in EI fed rams included increased rectal temperature (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.11) and respiration rate (day, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.25) when high ambient temperature exceeded 22 °C and reduced serum concentrations of prolactin (diet × day, P < 0.001). Body weight of EI fed rams tended to decrease after 36 days of feeding compared with EF fed rams (−3.0 kg versus 0.51 kg; P < 0.07) and BCS was similar between treatment throughout the trial. Serum concentrations of testosterone were greater in EI compared with EF fed rams (diet × day, P < 0.005, R2 = 0.08). Scrotal skin temperature, scrotal circumference, semen volume, percent sperm motility, and percent abnormal sperm were similar between treatments. Spermatozoa concentration tended to be greater in EF compared with EI fed rams after 43 days of feeding (P < 0.10; R2 = 0.15). Rate of forward movement of spermatozoa tended to increase at a greater rate between Days 8 and 29 in EF compared with EI fed rams (diet × day, P < 0.08). Feeding endophyte-infected fescue seed to ram lambs was associated with potential decreased fertility and increased serum concentrations of testosterone. Short term exposure of endophyte toxins to male ruminants may negatively impact reproductive responses. Feeding for longer periods may further reduce fertility and merits further research.

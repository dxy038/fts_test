Summary form only given. The objective of this presentation is to introduce an environmentally friendly Helical Turbine that has been developed to operate in free or ultra low-head water currents without dams. The turbine is a cross flow unidirectional rotation machine that makes it particularly valuable for ocean applications, such as reversible tidal streams in ocean bays, estuaries, streams in open ocean, underwater currents generated by wave fluctuations. It can also be used for hydropower in rivers without dams, canals, hydraulic tunnels, etc.

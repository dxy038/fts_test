The paper presents a state-space dynamic model for a bidirectional silicon controlled rectifier (the triac). The model exhibits programmable and controllable static and dynamic properties for a triac in all four modes of electrical operation. Computer-simulated transient electrical results of a pulse-width modulated a.c. chopper are in excellent agreement with results obtained experimentally.

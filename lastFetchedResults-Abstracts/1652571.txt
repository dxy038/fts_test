Dimeric chiral Mn(III) Schiff base complex 1 has been investigated as a catalyst for enantioselective epoxidation of chromenes, indene and styrene with an objective to explore its efficiency and recycling capability. Excellent conversions were obtained with all alkenes. More than 99% chiral induction, as determined by 1H NMR using the chiral shift reagent Eu(hfc)3, was obtained in the case of electron deficient chromenes, viz. nitro and cyano chromene.

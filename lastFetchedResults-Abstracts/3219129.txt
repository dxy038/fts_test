A novel contrast enhancement algorithm based on the layered difference representation is proposed in this work. We first represent gray-level differences at multiple layers in a tree-like structure. Then, based on the observation that gray-level differences, occurring more frequently in the input image, should be more emphasized in the output image, we solve a constrained optimization problem to derive the transformation function at each layer. Finally, we aggregate the transformation functions at all layers into the overall transformation function. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enhances images efficiently in terms of both objective quality and subjective quality.

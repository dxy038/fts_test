There are many aspects to optimisation of gas networks. Optimisation can mean searching, according to a certain objective function, for optimal design parameters, optimal structures for development or optimal parameters for operation of networks. The cost of operation for networks which is to be minimised, means in the case of high pressure gas networks, minimising running cost of compressors. For low and medium pressure gas networks, optimisation means leakage reduction by optimising nodal pressures. The paper is concerned with the minimisation of operating costs of high pressure gas networks

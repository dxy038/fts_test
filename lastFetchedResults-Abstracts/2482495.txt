Ophiopogon japonicus is a perennial, ornamental foliage plant, which
belongs to the family Liliaceae. It has a high demand in the local and
international export market due to the presence of glossy white-green stripped
lanceolate leaves. Improved leaves and plants of O. japonicus will be more
popular in the floriculture industry. Hence, objective was to investigate the
growth responses of O. japonicus for best potting media and fertilizer
treatments. Shoots of O. japonicus trimmed up to 4 cm from the root-shoot
junction were potted in two potting media as soil type 1, coir dust, compost
and sand as 1:1:1 and soil type 2, sand, coir dust 1:1 by volume. High nitrogen
fertilizer, balanced fertilizer and high phosphorous fertilizer were applied as
foliar sprays in three concentrations (×1/2, ×1 and ×2 times of the RBG recommended
dosages) and distilled water was used as the control. There was a
significant (p < 0.05) effect of growing media on the O. japonicus leaf length,
plant fresh weight, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, number of leaves and
number of shoots. However, there was no significant difference between the
control and fertilizer treatments on leaf length, shoot dry weight, number of
leaves and number of shoots while there was a significant difference among
fertilizer treatments on plant fresh weight and root dry weight. Most effective
potting media and fertilizer treatment for O. japonicus were sand:coir dust
media (1:1) and Royal Botanic Gardens, Sri Lanka-recommended dosage
(RBG) of fertilizer treatments (high nitrogen (2.5 g/L), balanced (1.25 g/L)
and high phosphorous fertilizer (2.5 g/L), respectively.

Increasingly, the improvement of the quality of TV pictures and new features as satellite TV and scrambled TV lead to digital processing of the video signal. As a consequence, A/D and D/A converters able to handle video signals become essential in this approach. Of course such devices are now commercially available and are used in a variety of professional pieces of equipment, but their price is hardly compatible with their use in a consumer TV set. In such applications the integration of a number of components allows the reduction of the price of the overall system to a level commercially acceptable. This was the background of a study* of A/D and D/A converters carried out at LEP** with the objective of reducing drastically the component count around each converter.

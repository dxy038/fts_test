The objective of this study was to determine the effects of plane of nutrition during early and mid-pregnancy on the
performance of mature ewes and their offspring. From day 0 to day 39 post mating (early pregnancy, EP), 82 multiparous ewes
were fed to provide either 60% (low, L), 100% (medium, M) or 200% (high, H) of predicted metabolisable energy (ME)
requirements for maintenance, following a synchronised mating. From day 40 to day 90 (mid-pregnancy, MP), ewes were
provided with either 80% (M) or 140% (H) of ME requirements. After 90 days of gestation, all ewes were fed to meet
requirements for late pregnancy. During EP, mean live weight (LW) and body condition score (BCS) change of ewes were 26.3,
20.8 and 16.0 kg and 20.02, 10.10 and 10.22 units in the L-, M- and H-EP treatments, respectively. During MP, mean LW
and BCS change were 20.8 and 14.9 kg and 20.09 and 10.09 units in the M- and H-MP treatments, respectively
(P,0.001). Treatments had no effect (P.0.05) on conception rate, although there tended to be an inverse relationship
(P50.085) between plane of nutrition in EP and plasma progesterone concentrations at day 42 of gestation. EP nutrition
influenced foetal development with lambs from ewes offered diet L-EP being smaller (P,0.01) at day 56 than M- or H-EP
lambs. However, at parturition L-EP lambs were heavier (P,0.05) and tended to have higher (P50.056) immunoglobulin
status 24 h after birth. Mortality rates at weaning were reduced (P,0.05) for lambs born from ewes offered diet L-EP
compared with M- or H-EP lambs. Diet M during mid-pregnancy resulted in larger (P,0.05) foetuses at day 80 of gestation.
At parturition, these lambs had longer head and crown-rump lengths than H-MP lambs (P,0.05). Lambs born to ewes offered
diet M-MP tended to progress faster to attempting to suckle than H-MP lambs (P50.089). There was an interaction between
plane of nutrition in early and mid-pregnancy, whereby the highest number of lambs weaned was a result of diet L-EP followed
by diet M-MP. These results indicate that in adult ewes, temporary nutrient restriction during early pregnancy results in better
lamb survival; and mild nutrient restriction in mid-pregnancy tends to improve neonatal behaviour and results in lambs with
longer skeletal size.

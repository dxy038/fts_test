The objective of this work is to generate random numbers with smooth distribution functions. It is used a two dimensional chaotic Hamiltonian map which produce smooth distribution functions. A mathematical analysis provides sufficient conditions to guarantee randomness. In this article we present its electronic implementation and include details of the real circuit and experimental results

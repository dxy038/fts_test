The evolution of communication technologies results in continuously increasing capacities and higher concentration of traffic on relatively fewer network elements. In order to avoid the influence of these failures on the services provided by the network several network resilience schemes have been developed and applied in real networks. The objective of the paper is to present a reliability analysis method based on stratified sampling. The method makes it possible to derive the network performance indices even in the case of real size networks by significantly decreasing the number of necessary states. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with some numerical examples

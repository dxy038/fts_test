Objective. – Tyrosine kinases (TKs) are important regulators of the L-type Ca2+  channel (LTCC) current in various cell types. However, there are no data addressing the role of TKs in the control of single LTCC activity in human atrial cardiac myocytes, where changes in LTCC gating properties have been described in a number of disease states.

Methods and results. – Single LTCC activity was recorded in isolated human atrial myocytes. The broad-spectrum TK inhibitor genistein and the Src family-selective TK inhibitor PP1 significantly enhanced single LTCC ensemble average current, availability, and open probability; the latter was due to significant increases of mean open time and mode 2 gating. Conversely, the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor bisperoxo—phenanthroline-vanadate inhibited single LTCC activity, indicating that LTCC gating properties in human atrial myocytes are controlled by TKs and tyrosine phosphatases in a reciprocal fashion. The effects of genistein on single LTCC activity were not affected by stimulation (8Br-cAMP) or inhibition (Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS) of protein kinase A (PKA) or by inhibition of serine/threonine phosphatases types I and IIa (okadaic acid), indicating that TKs inhibit LTCC gating in human atrial myocytes independent of PKA and phosphatases types I and IIa. However, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) by staurosporine or bisindolylmaleimide reversed the stimulatory effects of genistein on single LTCC gating properties, indicating that PKC is required for the inhibitory effect of TKs on single LTCC activity.

Conclusion. – Src family TKs inhibit single LTCC activity in human atrial myocytes via PKC-dependent, but PKA and phosphatase types I and IIa-independent, molecular pathways.

ldquoThe satellite industry, like all sectors of the telecommunications and computer markets worldwide, is in the process of rapid change in terms of technology, applications, regulation, and economics. In light of this pattern of rapid change, one must strive to stay up-to-date on the major trends in the satellite industry, as doing so is the key to understanding the future evolution of technology as well as the ensuing market changesrdquo. The objective of this paper is to highlight the design and project management of student satellite projects, as to introduce the concept of space engineering in the curriculum of universities and research institutions of developing countries. The author would also describe that how these projects could be introduced at undergraduate and postgraduate engineering levels with minimum resources available for the space education in Asia.

The problem of electromagnetic scattering by a conducting sphere partially buried in a conducting ground plane has been solved analytically using the method of images and the translation addition theorem for the spherical vector wave functions to satisfy the boundary condition on the surface of the spheres. The objective of the work is intended to be applied to the scattering by rough surface modeled by a system of partially buried spheres.

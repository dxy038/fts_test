Objective: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of Doppler audio-signal Processing system (DASPS) in noninvasive automatic estimation of pulmonary vascular resistance(PVR). Methods: PVR was estimated with DASPS in 32 children with left-to-right shunting congenital heart disease, compared with those estimated by Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Results: PVR estimated by DASPS adopting aorta, pulmonary artery, pulmonary venous and mitral flow time intervals highly correlated with those measured by cardiac catheterization (r=0.93, p&lt;;0.001), better than those measured by Doppler echocardiography (r=0.79, p&lt;;0.01). The time for estimating PVR with DASPS was shorter than with Doppler echocardiography (7.1&#177;&#177;2.3 min vs 57.5&#177;&#177;16.5min, p&lt;;0.05), the repeatability for DASPS was better than for Doppler echocardiography (p&lt;;0.05). Conclusion: PVR could be accurately quantitatively, noninvasively, auto-estimated by DASPS.

The objective of this work is to describe the viscoelastic behavior of metals up to their melting temperature by measuring the velocity and the attenuation of ultrasonics waves. For that purpose, a technique called laser-ultrasonics has been optimized for the high temperature domain and the solid to liquid transition. This paper is especially applied to the viscoelastic characterization of tin, from room temperature up to the melting point.

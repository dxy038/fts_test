An X-ray fluorescence imaging microscope with a Wolter-type grazing-incidence mirror objective was constructed at beamline 39XU of SPring-8. Monochromatic X-rays in the energy range 6â€“10 keV were used for X-ray fluorescence excitation of the specimens. Recording X-ray fluorescence images of a test specimen (Cu, Ni and Fe wires) from 50 different angles of view, three-dimensional tomographic reconstructions were obtained. These wires could be reconstructed selectively by changing the energy of the excitation X-rays. A synthetic diamond could also be imaged three-dimensionally.

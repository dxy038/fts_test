We consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-way relay network with two N<sub>T</sub>-antenna (N<sub>T</sub> &#8805; 2) end nodes and one dedicated NR-antenna (N<sub>R</sub> &gt;; N<sub>T</sub>) relay node. A physical-layer network coding (PNC) based joint relay antenna selection and zero-forcing (ZF) spatial multiplexing scheme is proposed to support N<sub>T</sub> streams of bidirectional data exchanging with the help of N<sub>T</sub> out of N<sub>R</sub> selected antennas at the relay node. The optimum relay antennas are selected by a Max-Min criterion with respect to the post-processing SNR of the whole system and then the linear ZF based MIMO two- way relay transmission is achieved with the help of the selected relay antennas. The optimum relay antenna selection not only fulfills the ZF based schemeÂ´s requirement on the number of effective relay antennas but also provides an end-to-end diversity advantage to the N<sub>T</sub> streams of bidirectional data exchanging with linear transceiver at each end node. The diversity order of the proposed scheme is analyzed. Explicit diversity order d = N<sub>R</sub> - 1 is obtained theoretically for N<sub>T</sub> = 2 streams of bidirectional data exchanging. For N<sub>T</sub> &#8805; 2 cases, a conjecture that d = N<sub>R</sub> - N<sub>T</sub> + 1 is obtained based on simulation results.

Summary form only given. The bidirectional pulser made from lines generates a bidirectional output voltage, and a voltage with reverse polarity is used to accelerate a beam. This system needs a cavity made from lines instead of a magnetic core used in the unidirectional pulse generator system in order to transfer the energy initially stored in the pulser to a beam. Using the system, it is possible to make the time integral of the output voltage zero. Thus the final energy stored in the system can be made zero at the end of the pulse, and the system attains the energy transfer efficiency of 100%. One of the highly efficient bidirectional pulse generators for external pulse injection, which was found by the authors, and a cavity were constructed and tested experimentally. The output impedance of the pulser and the cavity are 5.5 /spl Omega/ and 11 /spl Omega/, respectively and the pulse width for acceleration is 100 ns. The designed maximum charging voltage is 200 kV. The experimentally obtained voltage waveform on the dummy load agreed well with the computed one.

In this talk we describe a communication approach referred to as Random Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (R-OFDMA). This approach addresses directly issues of receiver complexity, collision handling, protocol overheads and scalability. Among the applications of this method reside such that require strategic survivability of the network (emergency services, public safety, and more). This approach addresses common problems of protocol based communication techniques, such as resource allocation management, collision detection and retransmission. These problems burdens a lot of overhead on the system utilization and throughput, especially in situations of increased collisions and retransmissions when the network tries to recover. In the wireless domain, a key objective of R-OFDMA is to segment between steady state and disaster, it does not aim for steady state daily situations where the currently proposed 4G solution is good enough. R-OFDMA assumes vast number of end users trying to communicate with data bursts simultaneously, but only prioritized active users that are responsible for recovery of the network will be active simultaneously. An important ingredient of R-OFDMA is based on spectrum sensing, where errors on its part may cause false alarms and miss identification events, which can potentially degrade the quality-of-service experienced by active users. In this work, we describe the high level mechanism of R-OFDMA, accompanied by problem formulation and we develop an analytical model in order to reflect different event classes caused by spectrum sensing.

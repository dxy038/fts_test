This paper consider a class of bidirectional associative memory (BAM) cellular neural networks with delays. By using the fixed point theorem and differential inequality techniques, some new sufficient conditions are established for the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of the almost periodic solutions. The obtained sufficient conditions are easy to verify and our results complement previously known results.

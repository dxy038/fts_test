The configuration of robot, the workspace analysis and optimization arc critical issues in robot manipulator design. The selection of structural parameters of a robot has a great influence on its workspace. The workspace is an important evaluating indicator. Based on the structure of the robot, the workspace is presented, and a mathematical model of optimum design of structural parameters of medical robot is set up with the workspace as an important constraint condition and configuration compact and the minimum weight as the objective function. A method is developed to solve the optimal value of structural parameters of the medical robot on condition that the requirement of the workspace is satisfied. This paper designs a radio frequency ablation medical robot system assisting surgeons effective treatment for patients with liver tumors. Surgery space, clinical operation requirements and optimize mechanical structure of robots requirement, are the key factors in designing a perfectly performing medical robot structure which is suitable for surgeons in their operation environment. The development of this medical robot system contributes to the promotion and popularization of the minimal invasive surgery.

Background and Objective: The Fallopian tube plays an essential role in tubal transport of
both gametes and embryos and successful pregnancy. We assessed the histomorphological effect of
smoking on the fallopian tubes in rats, in this study.
Patients and Methods: Twelve female rats were divided to two groups as subjects (n=7) and
controls (n=5). They have been exposed to smoke four times daily for 4 weeks. The histomorphological
effect of smoking on the fallopian tubes was assessed by H&E.
Results: The findings were hydrosalpinx in two cases and inflammation in one of them. There
was no reduction in the number of either the ciliated cells or the cilia.
Conclusion: The findings did not confirm our theory regarding smoking effect on the fallopian
tubesâ€™ tissue. Further studies with electronic microscope are recommended.

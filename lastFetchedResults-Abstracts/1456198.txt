The main objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of the polymer types in scrap tires on the pyrolysis products. Two different types of scrap tires (passenger car tire, PCT and truck tire, TT) have been pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor at the temperatures of 550, 650 and 800 °C under N2 atmosphere. Pyrolysis products (gas, oil and carbon black) obtained from PCT and TT were investigated comparatively. The gaseous products were analyzed by GC–TCD. The psychical and chemical properties of pyrolytic oils were characterized by means of GC–FID, GC–MS, 1H NMR. In addition, boiling point distributions of hydrocarbons in pyrolytic oils were determined by using simulated distillation curves in comparison with commercial diesel fuel. The production of activated carbon from pyrolytic carbon blacks (CBp) was also carried out. The composition of gaseous products from pyrolysis of PCT and TT were similar and they contained mainly hydrocarbons (C1–C4). Pyrolytic oils were found lighter than diesel but heavier than naphtha. The physical properties of pyrolytic oils from PCT and TT were similar at the same temperature. However, the composition of aromatic and sulphur content from pyrolysis of PCT was higher than that of TT. Furthermore, TT derived pyrolytic carbon black was found more suitable for the production of activated carbon due to its low ash content.

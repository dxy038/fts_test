Objective
known that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α converting enzyme (TACE) plays a crucial role in fibrotic inflammatory diseases, and is specifically inhibited by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-3. Fibrotic drug-induced gingival overgrowth (GO) is often combined with periodontitis. However, neither TACE nor TIMP-3 has been thoroughly examined in periodontal tissues to date. The aim of the present study was to analyse mRNA expression of TACE and TIMP-3, and protein localisation of TACE in gingival tissues removed from drug-(calcium-channel blocker) induced GO and periodontitis.
s
l of 30 gingival tissue samples were taken from 15 GO and 15 periodontitis patients. The mRNA expression levels were analysed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) and the protein localisation was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann–Whitney U-test.
s
nd TIMP-3 mRNA levels were significantly higher in GO compared to the periodontitis groups, as revealed by qRT-PCR (p &lt; 0.05). TACE-producing cells were immunohistochemically detected among monocytes/macrophages, plasma cells and some epithelial cells. TACE immunoreactivity was shown to be more intense in GO than in periodontitis-gingival tissue.
sions
e demonstrated TACE expression in cells such as macrophages, plasma cells and epithelial cells, and its predominant expression in GO tissues. This data suggests that TACE expression in GO-gingiva could be involved in the pathogenesis of disease.

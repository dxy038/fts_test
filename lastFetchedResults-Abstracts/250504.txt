This work presents the development and implementation of a synthesis and optimization procedure
based on genetic algorithms (GA). A modified version of the basic GA, consisting in a hybrid fuzzyâ€“
GA, is considered. The performance of the optimization procedure is improved by employing linguistic
knowledge and uncertainties inherent of human thinking. This eases the definition of the penalty and
global objective functions that would be required in a standard GA procedure, which is not a simple
task since it involves subjective assumptions. The application of the proposed procedure is focused
on the design of steel catenary risers (SCRs) for floating oil production units at deep and ultra-deep
waters. The application of this procedure is illustrated first by a small academic example, and then
by a case study involving the design of lazy-wave configurations of SCRs

In this paper, the evolution of design methods is briefly analyzed and discussed with reference to artificial organs intended to substitute for metabolic bodily functions. In the last seventy years, the methods of artificial organ design have evolved towards a more systematic approach that more and more accounts for biological issues (man-machine interfaces, biocompatibility issues, etc.) to the point that at the forefront of research the design paradigm is shifting from fully synthetic mechanical/electronic prostheses towards the development in vitro of tissue engineered replacement organs/tissues, where the artificial part is fully integrated with the biological counterpart. To keep up with this complex scenario, design methods have shifted: from an experiments-based to the methodical approach; from one to multiple objective functions; from focusing on one single process to multiple concurring processes, often differing in time and space scale; from seeking solutions consisting of one device to many coupled devices; from seeking a generic solution for all patients´ needs to seeking personalized solutions for each patient, so that the patient should not adapt to an existing device or implant, but it is the device or implant that has to adapt to the patients´ specific needs and circumstances. The impact of this evolution in design on the way courses in biomedical engineering are organized and taught in Europe is also briefly analyzed and discussed.

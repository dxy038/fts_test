Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this study was performing content analysis of Iranian sport newspapers with an emphasis on wrestling.
Methodology: This was a descriptive study done mainly by content analysis. The statistical samples were selected from 10 popular sport newspapers in random and rotationally during the 3 months before the Beijing Olympic Games (2008). The data was gathered by a coding sheet the validity of which was then approved. The units for analysis were content, covering level, news value, orientation and the important character of wrestling.
Results: Findings indicated that less than 5 percent of news coverage was about wrestling and more than 90 percent was dedicated to soccer news and pictures. Wrestling didn't have any first or second title in sport newspapers, however football had more than 90 percent title coverage even though it didnâ€™t have any delegate in 2008 Beijing.
Conclusion: It is suggested that sport & youth ministry and ministry of culture and Islamic Guidance should apply some incentive programs like supporting the sport newspapers so that they  pay more attention to most hopeful national sports for Olympic medals.

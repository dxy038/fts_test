Proposes a linear parameter varying (LPV) controller design for automated lane keeping for vehicles. The lane keeping objective is to keep a point on the vehicle centered with respect to the lane boundaries by applying appropriate steering action. It is known that the position response of the vehicle to the steering input varies significantly with the longitudinal velocity of the vehicle. The LPV design technique allows for the controller to be a continuous function of longitudinal velocity. The controller minimizes the induced L<sub>2</sub> norm of the closed loop from the road curvature to the tracking error. The design has been implemented on a tractor semi-trailer vehicle and experiments conducted up to longitudinal velocity of 55 MPH (legal speed limit for tractor semi-trailer vehicles in California) are presented

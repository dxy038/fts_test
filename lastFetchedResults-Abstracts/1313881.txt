Background and objective: Adolescence is a period of life that
life style is formed and stabilized while the nutritional status of
adolescents toward fruit and vegetable consumption (FVC) isn’t in
desirable level. This study was aimed to determine the predictors of
FVC among female high school students based on PRECEDE model.
Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study that was
done among 400 female high school students in Quchan selected
by using two stage sampling method. Data was collected by using
a self-report, reliable and valid questionnaire. Descriptive (mean,
standard deviation, frequency and percentage) and analytical
statistics (linear regression analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient
and one way ANOVA) were used for analyzing the data.
Results: The mean age of the students was 16.11±1.076. Reinforcing
factors (B=0.282; r < 0.0001), enabling factors (B=0.207 P < 0.0001)
and knowledge (B=0.117; r < 0.0001) were predictor factors for FVC.
The mean score of knowledge was 70.13±16.08, the mean score of
attitude 77.73±11.14, the mean score of enabling factors 50.93±18.02,
the mean score of reinforcing factors 72.75±15.42 and the mean
score of behavior were 61.66±15.66. There was a significant positive
correlation between PRECEDE model constructs and behavior.
Conclusion: The findings suggest that reinforcing factors, enabling
factors, and knowledge were the most important predictor factor,
respectively. Knowledge, attitude and reinforcing factor status
are in a desirable level. Enabling factors and behavior status is in
the moderate level. According to the positive correlation between
PRECEDE model constructs and behavior, we recommended
appropriate intervention, especially educational intervention with
particular emphasis on PRECEDE model constructs and reinforcing
factors as the most important behavior predictor in related FVC.

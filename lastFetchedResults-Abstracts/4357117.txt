The emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in last few decades, increases the efficiency and accuracy of large number of applications such as defense, habitat monitoring, industrial and many more. The efficiency and accuracy of WSN is largely affected by the different security attacks and emergence of new attacks. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and countermeasure the new ways of security attacks to make WSN proficient. The objective of the paper is to address this problem. The paper proposes the intelligent cluster head (CH) jamming attack, which will take place in cluster-based network. This attack disturbs the communication inside and outside the cluster. The paper also proposes the solution to countermeasure the attack during both inter- and intra- cluster communication. The proposed solution shows good performance efficiency of WSN in presence of intelligent CH jamming attack.

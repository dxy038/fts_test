The objective of this study is to express the four types of personality of a robot based on Myers-Briggs Type Indicator by controlling the size, speed, and frequency of the gestures of a robot and to examine userpsila impressions of the robot by controlling the gesture design factors. The independent variables were three gesture design factors (speed, velocity, and frequency) with two levels each, producing eight gesture types. The eight gesture types were presented in two robot positions, a speaking robot and a listening robot. Participants watched a total of 16 robot gesture samples and evaluated each sample on the personality of the robot and their impressions. The evaluation results provided basic guidelines to express robot personalities through gestures, describing specific methods to control the speed, velocity, and frequency of a gesture. In addition, it was found that personality expression of a robot through gesture and the control of gesture design factors affect user impression of a robot.

Our concern is the development of speech enhancement techniques for hands-free audio terminals, including two major problems: noise reduction and acoustic echo cancellation. The objective is to find a joint structure to get a near-end speech signal with minimum distortion and low levels of echo and noise. To solve the two problems, a new promising technique is investigated and tested in real conditions.

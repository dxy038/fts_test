It is general to use the level differences of the pixel in the area to extract a tissue part or the region of interest from the ultrasonogram. However, because there is a high possibility that clear edges do not appear in the ultrasonogram, it is difficult to extract the region of interest only using the method of level difference. Thus, the technique which extracts the tissue part using shape oriented method is considered to be effective. In this research, to extract a tissue region from ultrasonogram, fuzzy morphology operations which reflect shape information of the region, are introduced. The authorsÂ´ objective is to build a system that is capable to extract a region of interest accurately

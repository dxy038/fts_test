To keep pace with the increasing popularity of image and video sharing services, several research groups have focused on the development of systems to identify similar copies images and videos on the internet. Although these techniques allow us to identify the set of near-duplicates of a document, they do not give any information about the structure of generation of the near-duplicates. In this paper, we are interested in the history of the transformations that generated a given a set of near-duplicate videos. Given a set of near-duplicate videos, our objective is to identify their causal/phylogenetic relationships. Solutions to this problem have several applications such as in security, forensics, copyright enforcement, and news tracking services.

Rainfall erosivity as one of the major factors of soil erosion is expressed as indexes‏.‏‎ The ‎objective of this study is determining the appropriate rainfall erosivity index in Iran and ‎generalizes it by its estimation from more readily available indexes to stations without ‎rainfall intensity data and to determine the most accurate interpolation method for ‎preparation of its map. For this reason, necessary data were collected from seven soil ‎erosion research plots in Western Azerbyjan, Khorasan Razavi, Zanjan, Semnan, ‎Mazandaran, Markazi, and Yazd provinces, respectively. The rainfall intensities were ‎recorded, as was the sediment yield associated with storm events, and 64 different ‎erosivity indices based on rainfall intensity were computed for these soil erosion research ‎stations. Our founding shows that ‎ ‎ were the best correlated with sediment than other ‎erosivity index. Further, rainfall erosivity indices, based on the amount of rainfall, were ‎also computed for all soil erosion research plots and synoptic and climatic stations. The ‎results showed that the modified Fournier index had a significant correlation with ‎ ‎ ‎After normalizing the primary ‎ ‎ data, semi-variograms were determined and the best ‎model was obtained. Then, different interpolation methods were compared and spline was ‎chosen for drawing the rainfall erosivity map. The output map showed a decreasing trend ‎from west and north to east and south of the country and this trend was correlated with ‎climatic change from humid to semiarid regions.‎

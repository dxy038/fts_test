The non-fixed destination multi-depot multiple traveling salesmen problem (MmTSP) is a
generalization of well-known MTSP with several salesmen in each depot. In this research,
time window is defined for each depot (city).the salesmen only can service the customers
within these time windows and also some penalties are considered for any deviation of start
time. The objective function of problem is to minimize the total costs and penalties of the
tours. This problem is of a great complexity and belongs to NP-complete class of problems.
So the exact algorithms cannot perform the best solution in problems with big dimension. So
Meta heuristics algorithm is used to solve these problems efficiently. In this research we used
hybrid simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.

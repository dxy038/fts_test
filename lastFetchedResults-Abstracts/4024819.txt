The objective of the paper is to establish <i>L</i> <sub>q</sub>-stability results for the state processes of a new class of slowly time-varying hybrid continuous-time linear stochastic systems. The systems are hybrid in the sense that jumps both in the dynamics and the state may occur. In both cases a jump amounts to resetting to an initial value. Jump-times are defined by a more or less arbitrary point process. Most of the analysis is based on a carefully organized stochastic Lyapunov-function argument. We motivate our study by a brief summary of some basic problems in continuous-time recursive estimation of linear stochastic systems within a framework analogous to the one developed by Benveniste <i>et al.</i>

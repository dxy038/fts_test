With the increasing popularity of hand held devices for accessing internet services wireless mesh network has become an attractive option to internet service providers. The objective of the network is to provide seamless internet connectivity to the mobile internet users. To fulfill the objective, mobility management of the mesh clients (MC) is necessary. This paper focuses on three mobility management schemes: MEsh networks with MObility management (MEMO), Mesh Mobility Management (M<sup>3</sup>) and adaptive mobility management scheme. The performance of the three schemes is compared quantitatively in terms of communication cost. It can be observed that the adaptive mobility management scheme performs better than the other two schemes since the adaptive scheme enables MCs to send location update message to the gateway depending on their characteristics such as: session activity and mobility.

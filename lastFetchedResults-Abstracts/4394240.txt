A novel way to identify fast-varying parameters of Non-linear systems in the closed-loop is described in this study. The new estimation algorithm introduced in this paper is based on short-time analysis of the regressing variables in order to minimize locally a linear quadratic form cost function and called &#8220;Short-Time Linear Quadratic Form (STLQF)&#8221; technique. The established cost function produces a linear combination of errors with several delays. Toward this objective, mathematical development of the STLQF estimation algorithm is described. For casting implementation of the STLQF algorithm into an applied framework, the algorithm is applied to a 3-DOF mobile robot with fast-varying parameters of inertia, coulomb and viscous frictions.

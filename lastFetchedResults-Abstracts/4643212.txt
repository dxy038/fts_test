Computer-based assessment became one of the most common forms of technology enhanced assessment since the 1990s. Bloom´s Taxonomy is widely used as a classification scheme to determine different levels of cognitive competencies. Using CBT for assessment has often been described as a tool to test on the lower levels of Bloom´s taxonomy and that it promotes rote learning because it is very difficult to write items that will test on the higher cognitive levels. A study was done in the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Pretoria to obtain the perception of students and lecturers regarding the level and use of computer-based objective assessment. From the study it is clear that it is a suitable assessment method to test on a variety of cognitive levels.

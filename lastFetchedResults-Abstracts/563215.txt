The diagnostic accuracy of tuberculosis can be enhanced by new tests like gamma interferon used in conjunction with tuberculin test but these tests are quite expensive to be conducted on all animals in resource poor countries. The present study was conducted to clarify the usefulness of haematological parameters and changes in serum proteins along with tuberculin test in different animal species. In buffaloes, significantly lower RBC count, WBC count, Hb concentration, neutrophils and eosinophils while significantly higher monocytes percentage along with serum total proteins, albumin and globulins were observed in tuberculin positive reactors. In cattle, significantly lower RBC count, PCV, neutrophils and serum albumin, while lymphocyte percentage was significantly higher in positive reactor animals. In sheep, PCV was lower in positive reactors. In goats, basophils percentage was significantly higher (P = 0.002) in positive reactors. A significant positive correlation of Hb with RBC and PCV in positive reactor buffaloes, goats and sheep was observed. The correlation statistics for differential leukocyte percentage did not differ between positive and negative reactor animals of these species. In cattle and goats, albumin showed significant positive correlation with globulins in negatively reacting animals, while this correlation was non-significant in positive reactor animals. In buffaloes, albumin showed a significant positive correlation with globulins and this correlation was non-significant in negative reactor buffaloes. It was concluded that tuberculosis caused decrease in erythrocyte parameters including RBC count, PCV and Hb concentration, while it caused an increase in monocytes, eosinophils and lymphocytes

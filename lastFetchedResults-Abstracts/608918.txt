Objective (s): To translate and evaluate the validity and reliability of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, as a disease-specific quality of life scale in patients with angina pectoris.
Method: After permission, the questionnaire was translated. Then face validity, content validity, concurrent validity and criterion validity were determined. In order to evaluate the construct validity, known-groups comparison (patients with and without chest symptoms) was performed and to determine its criterion validity the Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used. Cronbach's alpha coefficients and the test retest were used to assess the scale reliability. 100 patients with angina pectoris participated in this study. 
Results: The criterion validity showed high and significant correlation between most SAQ and SF-36 scores. Cronbachâ€™s alpha of the total scale was 0.85 and test-retest reliability (ICC) within 2 weeks, in all dimensions was greater than 0. 90. 
Conclusion: The findings suggest that the SAQ is a valid and reliable disease-specific scale and can be considered for measuring health outcomes in research and clinical settings.

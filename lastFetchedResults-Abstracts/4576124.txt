The minimisation of the objective function is a common requirement in signal processing. The author addresses the problem of finding all of the global minima of a real-valued objective function <e1>f</e1> which can be expressed as a polynomial over a finite interval. The approach is based on generating a modified Sturm sequence from <e1>f</e1>-<e1>z</e1> where <e1>z</e1> is the value of <e1>f</e1> at the global minima. The technique provides the number of the global minima of <e1>f</e1>, the value of <e1>z</e1> and the locations of the global minima of <e1>f</e1>. A simple numerical example is given. While the author concentrates on the one-dimensional case, the extension of the method to multidimensional objective functions is also discussed

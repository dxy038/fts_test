In this article, a cost-effective 6DOF Stewart-type platform driven by piezoelectric actuator is studied. Designs of the flexure hinge mechanism and the error compensation model are useful to deal with the problem due to manufacture error and assembly error. The nonlinear hysteresis effect of the piezoelectric actuator is analyzed by means of the proposed dynamic Preisach model. Its inverse model is used as the feedforward controller. From practical experiment, the designed platform can achieve the objective of nanoscale positioning without the need of sensor-feedback.

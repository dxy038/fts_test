An adaptive ecology m-learning framework applied for national parks is proposed in this paper. The traditional ecology guiding service uses static web page or fixed placard to prompt and provide ecology information to learners. It can not provide adaptive learning anytime and anywhere. Learners can not obtain real-time ecology guiding information and have a good adaptive learning based on learners´ knowledge background, and time and location. This study proposes a framework based on Scaffolding Theory that provide learners mobile, dynamic and adaptive ecology guiding service to national parks. Scaffolding Theory is to support learners a knowledge structure for systematic learning. Based on Scaffolding Theory, learners are identified by background (e.g. age and gender), knowledge (e.g. cognitive base, knowledge requirement and learning objective), and interests. Moreover, adaptive and appropriate ecology knowledge based on learners´ properties is provided dynamically. Furthermore, learning steps and contents are able to be adjusted flexibly by learners´ feedback. In addition, this study also adopt context awareness to provide the learner a suitable route planning for ecology guiding service according to environment factors such as weather condition, time and season, prediction of tide, UV rays and rain rate where learners located. Landscapes and ecology events such as Migratory birds in transit within the route can be actively delivered to learners immediately using interactive applications such as multimedia messages (e.g. text, image and video). Attention and enjoyment of learners can be increased and ecology education purpose of national parks can be achieved.

In this study, we present a numerical analysis of cracks located at the end of the contact zone in 2D cylindrical fretting problems. The numerical modeling of the crack is performed with a single finite element mesh that does not need to conform to the crack geometry thanks to the use of the extended finite element method (X-FEM). The proposed approach enables the study of the crackâ€“contact interaction effects in an efficient and systematic way. The objective of this study is to assess whether the crack presence modifies the contact conditions in a significant manner. The influence of these effects on the stress intensity factors for different crack lengths and angles is also ascertained.

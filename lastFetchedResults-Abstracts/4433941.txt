In this paper, the power architectures and the power electronics circuit topologies for future megawatt electric vehicle (EV) superfast charging stations with enhanced grid support functionality are discussed and a promising power architecture is proposed. The paper first does a literature research. Based on the literature research, the disadvantages of the existing technologies are identified. A power architecture is proposed for megawatt multifunctional EV charging stations to get over the disadvantages of the existing technologies. The power architecture is integrated with grid energy storage, renewable energy sources and it can carry bidirectional power flows. The proposed power architecture cannot only charge EVs but also simultaneously achieve grid support functions. The proposed power architecture can also achieve high efficiency and high reliability. Bidirectional DC/DC converters, medium frequency transformer design and control scheme are also briefly discussed in the paper. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the proposed technical approach.

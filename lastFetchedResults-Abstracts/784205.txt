Purpose Our theoretical model proposes that insomnia,
worry, and negative affect are important determinants of
paranoid thinking. Anxiety produces anticipation of threat,
depression increases the sense of vulnerability, worry leads
to implausible ideas, and insomnia exacerbates negative
affect and creates an altered perceptual state. The study
objective was to examine for the first time these factors as
predictors of the onset of new paranoid thinking and of the
persistence of existing paranoid thinking.
Method A total of 2,382 participants in the 2000 British
National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were followed-up
18 months after their first assessment. Baseline assessments
were used to predict the development and persistence of
paranoid thinking at follow-up. Data were weighted to be
representative of the general household population.
Results Insomnia, worry, anxiety, depression and
depressive ideas were each substantial predictors both of
new inceptions of paranoia and of the persistence of
existing paranoid thinking. Worry and insomnia were the
strongest predictors. For example, insomnia at the first
assessment led to a more than threefold increase in later
inceptions of paranoid thinking.
Conclusions The study indicates that insomnia, worry,
anxiety and depression are potential risk factors for new
inceptions of paranoid thinking. The results also corroborate
an emerging literature indicating that anxiety, worry
and depression may encourage the persistence of paranoid
thinking. The study provides the first longitudinal evidence
linking insomnia and paranoia. The important clinical
implication is that the use of interventions for common
mental health difficulties in people with psychosis may
have the additional benefit of reducing paranoia

Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare the rates of painful bladder syndrome and functional bowel disorders in women with vulvar disease and control subjects.
Study design
In this cross-sectional survey, a questionnaire that contained validated outcome measures was administered to women who were seeking care in a vulvar disease clinic and in general gynecology clinics.
Results
Women who were seen at a vulvar disease clinic were 2.18 (95% CI, 1.19, 3.97) times more likely to have painful bladder syndrome and 2.13 (95% CI, 1.35, 3.35) times more likely to have functional bowel disorders than general gynecology clinic control subjects after multivariable analyses.
Conclusion
Painful bladder syndrome and functional bowel disorders are more prevalent in women who are seen at a vulvar disease clinic than gynecology clinics control subjects. These associations may reflect a common origin for these disorders in certain women. These findings lay the groundwork for future research to investigate a potential “pelvic floor pain disorder,” which is a disease entity that would combine the diagnostic criteria for vulvar, bladder, and bowel pain disorders.

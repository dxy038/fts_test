In this paper, researched the algorithmic mechanism of MIGA and NSGA-II deeply. Based on structure vibration energy and system control energy as multi-objective optimization functions of the structure vibration system, set up the optimal disposition mathematical model which referred to the system control gain and the sensors and actuators placements, quantities, lengths of the active vibration control system, adopted Fast and Elitist Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) as multi-objective optimization policy, at the same time, based on the reserve energy as single-objective optimization function and Multi-Island Genetic Algorithm (MIGA) as single-objective optimization policy, simulating experimented with a cantilever beam as an example, the results were accordant to each other. Hence, the validity and feasibility of the methods were validated.

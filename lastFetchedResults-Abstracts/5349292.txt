We present an approach for personal information management for mobile devices like PDAs based on the Semantic Desktop. The main objective is to design and realize a recommendation system to identify interesting items (e.g. messages or documents) based on the current context (time and location) and a user\Â´s personal ontology. To do so, our algorithm uses an evaluation function to traverse the graph of resources and rank nodes. Relevant resources and other items such as points-of-interests can also be displayed on a map on the mobile device. The ideas have been implemented and (rudimentarily) tested in the "SeMoDesk" application.

This talk describes the experience of weaving research in computer science education, and how it can be carried over to software engineering. Curriculum is designed with the objective that students can undertake projects as early as possible. As a result, specially designed technology courses are brought in early on (much like the carpenter learning the tools and power tools in a hands-on manner). Concepts are presented through normal courses but to allow flexibility in choice of courses, long pre-requisite chains are broken carefully. This provides the backdrop in which students are encouraged to choose a stream and undertake research in it, while at the same time learning broad basics. This encourages students to experiment and learn with joy. A suitably-designed flexible curriculum and passionate faculty who radiate the joy of their work are important elements but not sufficient. Students are under tremendous peer pressure to take up routine and ordinary jobs merely because they pay well. A strong base of human values is necessary so that students examine their life goals, and get in touch with what they really want to be/do. This serves as the foundation on which professional ethics can be discussed. Thus, it helps them in becoming a good researcher, as well as a good human being.

A model of the auditory periphery assembled from analog network submodels of all the relevant anatomical structures is described. There is bidirectional coupling between networks representing the outer ear, middle ear, and cochlea. A simple voltage source representation of the outer hair cells provides level-dependent basilar membrane curves. The networks are translated into efficient computational modules by means of wave digital filtering. A feedback unit regulates the average firing rate at the output of an inner hair cell module via a simplified modeling of the dynamics of the descending paths to the peripheral ear. This leads to a digital model of the entire auditory periphery with applications to both speech and hearing research.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

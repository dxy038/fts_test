Model finding procedures have traditionally relied on a systematic search of the space of possible models. Recently, an alternative, non-systematic approach has emerged, which is based on randomized local search. On certain problem classes, such methods have been shown to be significantly faster than systematic search. A good example of the difference between systematic search and non-systematic search can be found in the work on the N-queens problem. The author discusses this example

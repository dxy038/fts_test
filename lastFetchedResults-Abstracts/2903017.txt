Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are prone to a variety of attacks due to their unique characteristics like dynamic topology, open wireless medium, absence of infrastructure, multi hop nature and resource constraints. A node in MANET acts not only as an end terminal but both as router and client. In this way, multi-hop communication occurs in MANETs and thus it becomes much more difficult task to establish a secure path between the source and destination. The objective of this work is to overcome a special kind of attack called wormhole attack launched by at least two colluding nodes within a network In this research paper work, some modifications has been done in AODV routing protocol to detect and remove wormhole attack in real-world MANET. Wormhole attack detection and prevention algorithm, WADP, has been implemented in modified AODV. Also node authentication has been used to detect malicious nodes and remove false positive problem that may arise in WADP algorithm. Node authentication not only removes false positive but also helps in mapping exact location of wormhole and is a kind of double verification for wormhole attack detection. Simulation results proves the theory.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Methamphetamine is a stimulant substance which its main component is amphetamine (C9H13N). In Iran, methamphetamine is known as Shisheh. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of methamphetamine (Iranian Shisheh) on serum levels of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), cortisol and aldosterone in male rats. 
METHODS: In this laboratory experimental study, 20 male Wistar rats were randomly divided to control, saline receiving and 2, 4 and 6 mg/kg/body weight of Shisheh receiving groups of 5 rats in each group. The injection was carried out intraperitoneally once a week for 6 weeks. After serum collection, ACTH, cortisol and aldosterone levels were measured using ELISA method.
FINDINGS: Serum ACTH level was not significantly different in saline receiving (1.85±0.22) compared to control group (1.23±0.22); however, significantly increased in groups receiving 2mg/kg (2.55±0.17) (p=0.003), and 4 mg/kg (2.63±0.22) (p=0.002) of Shisheh compared to control group. Serum ACTH level was higher in the group receiving 6mg/kg (3.83±0.55) (p < 0.0005) than 2 or 4 mg/kg of Shisheh receiving groups. Serum cortisol level was not significantly different in saline receiving (0.32±0.06) (p=0.385) compared to control group (0.58±0.14); however, significantly increased in groups receiving 2mg/kg (6.35±0.25) (p < 0.0005), and 4 mg/kg (6.42±0.29) (p < 0.0005) and 6 mg/kg of Shisheh (6.81±0.23) (p < 0.0005) compared to control group. Serum aldosterone level was not significantly different in saline receiving (1492±18.9) compared to control group (1396.6±16.3); however, significantly increased in groups receiving 2mg/kg (1726±38.3) (p < 0.0005), and 4 mg/kg (1749.6±81.4) (p < 0.0005) and 6 mg/kg of Shisheh (1785.3±56.2) (p < 0.0005) compared to control group.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that Shisheh injection can enhance adrenal gland activity in turn might followed by considerable clinical complications.

With the global manufacturing becoming, supply chain management(SCM) get general application and become a new management model. From the view of manufacturing enterprises and considering the performance metrics of supply chain operation reference(SCOR) model, now, enterprises come to realize that effective supply chain management, which would have to assess supply chain performance. However, scientific, objective and comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the supply chain operating performance is an urgent problem need to be addressed. Based on analyzing the present fact of domestic and international vendor performance evaluation, Based on the construction of index system for manufacturing supplier ability evaluation and analysis, a new method is presented in this paper, which apply the principal component, the fisher method and K-NN Classifiers method of multivariate statistical analysis, it could grade them. And then identify the Misclassified enterprises by K-NN on the base of above analysis. ItÂ´s proved to be reliable and effective in practical application, and the analysis result may be regarded as one of main foundations for reference, the paper investigated suppliers choice and supply chain design on the basis of performance evaluation by means of methods of mulitity statistics comprehensive assessment and goal programming. Finally, the model is approved by a case provided which is practical and effective. The result shows that the model could reflect the gener capabilities of the supplier objectively and fairly and achieve an effective evaluation on supplier performance and which plays a role of illumination for supply chain design.

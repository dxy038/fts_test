This paper deals with multi-objective behavior coordination and sensory networks based on fuzzy control for multiple mobile robots. In multi-objective behavior coordination, weights are assigned to basic behaviors and updated gradually according to the time series of sensory inputs. A robot with our behavior coordination can take a smooth action. The sensory network is the self-update mechanism of a sensory range in order to realize flexible control with a small number of control rules. Both methods have been successfully applied to a single mobile robot. In this paper, we focus on an environment including multiple mobile robots. We examine the effects of the values for updating behavior weights and sensory ranges on the performance of multiple mobile robots. From the experimental results, we show the effectiveness of the multi-objective behavior coordination and sensory networks in the environment including multiple mobile robots.

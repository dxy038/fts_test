Generic technology, which can be widely applied to various industries, is of great economic and social benefits because of its fundamentality, externality and sharable nature. The present researches on generic technology are mainly directed by governments and generic technology projects always last long and cost a lot, so it is essential to do some studies on the evaluation system of generic technology. Based on a thorough analysis about the character of generic technology, an four factors evaluation model, which contains such aspects as competitiveness of technology, capacity of industrialization, capability of creating benefits and capacity of technology organizations, is proposed in this paper. Then, we build an evaluation index system based on the four factors model and obtain an optimal sequence selection of generic technology projects using multi-objective fuzzy optimization model. We hope that what we have done will be a feasible reference for the government generic technology selection.

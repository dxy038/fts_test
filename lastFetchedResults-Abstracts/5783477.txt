In this paper, we consider a stabilization problem of a two-qubit system under continuous measurement. Our objective is to stabilize two types of quantum entangled state which play an important role in quantum information technology. In this paper, we show that the global stabilization at a specific quantum entangled state by continuous inputs is possible. An effectiveness of the control input is verified by numerical simulation.

The objective of this study is to show the interest of superconductivity at 30 GHz compared to traditional planar technologies used at ambient and low temperatures. This paper presents the design and the measures at 77 K of high temperature superconducting (HTS) preselect receive filters for satellite communication. Comparisons of HTS and metal based planar filters have shown the performance gap between both at 30 GHz.

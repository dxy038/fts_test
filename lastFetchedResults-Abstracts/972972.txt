The Monte Carlo simulation method was used to model thermal desorption of a pair of enantiomers from a solid surface with a chiral periodic pattern of active sites. The main objective of the study was to determine the optimal number of the active sites and their spatial distribution within the unit cell of the surface to achieve the most efficient separation of the enantiomers. For that purpose we tested the series of chiral patterns which were found previously for the equilibrium adsorption. Temperature programmed desorption spectra were calculated using a square lattice of adsorption sites in which the active sites were distributed spatially according to the candidate patterns. Additionally, influence of relaxation of the adsorbed layer on the relative shift of the TPD peaks of the enantiomers was assessed and the key factors affecting the chiral separation were identified.

Summary form only given. Mid-infrared (&#955;=3-5 &#956;m) lasers with InAsSb-containing double heterostructure or multiquantum well (MQW) active regions show high output power and low threshold current densities but are limited to temperatures lower than 220 K due to leakage current and Auger recombination. Recently, electrically pumped type-II "W" laser diodes exhibited operation near room temperature. The objective of this study was the fabrication of InAsPSb/InAsSb/InAsP MQW-LEDs and lasers with type-II "W" design and with the highest emission intensities at 3.3-3.9-&#956;m wavelength.

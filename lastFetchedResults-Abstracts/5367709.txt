The objective of this paper is to use the T-S fuzzy bilinear model to describe nonlinear system with high accuracy and with as fewer IF-THEN rules as possible via input/output data which collect from original nonlinear system and fuzzy c-regression models (FCRM) clustering algorithm applied to bilinear models. A novel cluster validity criterion suitable for the bilinear models will be presented. The simulation example is provided to demonstrate the accuracy of the fuzzy bilinear model.

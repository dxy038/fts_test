Industrial applications have specific needs which require dedicated solutions. On the one hand, MEMS can be used as affordable and tailored solution while on the other hand, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) enhance the mobility and give more freedom in the design of the overall architecture. Integrating these two technologies would allow more optimal solutions in terms of adaptability, ease of deployment and reconfigurability. The objective of this article is to define the new challenges that will have to be solved in the specific context of wireless MEMS networks applied to industrial applications. To illustrate the current state of development of this domain, two projects are presented: the Smart Blocks project and the OCARI project.

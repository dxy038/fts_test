The subject of performance measurement (PM) is generating increasing interest in both the academic and managerial ambits. Although the subject of manufacturing performance measurement (MPM) has recently become a very crucial issue, little has been done to identify the critical performance dimensions (competitive priorities), to enumerate the measures that exist, and how to select the appropriate measures. The primary objective of this paper is to identify the critical dimensions of performance and to identify a set of measures that reflects the performance it is trying to achieve as a first step to design an effective PM system. The second objective is to propose a framework to select the appropriate measures.

Isonicotinoylhydrazones 1, obtained by the primary antituberculous agent Isoniazid, have been used as monoanionic ligands (L) to prepare copper(II) 2 and nickel(II) 3 octahedral complexes of stoichiometry [MeL2(H2O)2]. Their antimycobacterial in vitro activity was evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in comparison with the ligands. Complexes 2a, 2b, 2f, 3b, 3d and 3g displayed MIC values  0.2 Î¼g/mL.

The objective of this study is to describe the surgical planning of the inferior dermoglandular pedicle (IDP) technique and its outcome following partial mastectomy reconstruction. A total of 26 patients with breast cancer underwent immediate IDP reconstruction. IDP was indicated to reconstruct superior/central breast defects. Postoperative complications were evaluated and information on esthetic result and satisfaction were collected. About 57.6 percent had tumors measuring 2cm or less (T1). Immediate complications occurred in 34.2 percent with skin necrosis in 11.4 and dehiscence in 7.6 percent. Late complications were observed in 11.4 percent. The cosmetic result was considered to be good or very good in 88.4 percent and the majority of patients were satisfied. All complications were treated by conservative approach. IDP is a reliable technique and should be given consideration in cases of superior/central quadrant reconstruction. The success of the procedure depends on patient selection and careful intra-operative management

This paper deals with the supervisory control of a discrete event system which is modeled by a state machine of which the states and the structure have their own physical meanings related to the real system. The control objective is specified by a desired transition trajectory set to consider the internal behavior as well as the output behavior, which is represented by a generated language. A supervisory control problem to get a desired internal behavior is defined, and a minimally restrictive solution is provided. Using the relation between the internal behavior and the output behavior, the control problem is reduced to a control problem to get a generated language corresponding to the internal behavior

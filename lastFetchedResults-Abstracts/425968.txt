The Contingent Ranking Method—a feasible and valid method when eliciting preferences for health care? The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility and validity of the contingent ranking method, when eliciting preferences and measuring willingness to pay for health care. A measurement experiment based on ranking data is reported. Marginal willingness to pay for alleviation of rheumatoid arthritis symptoms that may be the outcome of a treatment with a novel anti-rheumatic agent, cA2 (now called TNF-α  blockade) was calculated. The estimated marginal willingness to pay value was 650 DKK ($93). With regard to the health status variables and income variable the signs of the coefficients were, as expected, positive. The contingent ranking method is a feasible and valid method for eliciting preferences and determining willingness to pay estimates.

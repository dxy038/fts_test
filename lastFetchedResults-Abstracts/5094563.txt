Swarming networks of mobile autonomous agents require inter-agent position information in order perform various tasks. The primary control input for the majority of current control strategies is inter-agent distance information. In this paper we provide a robust parallel filter based tracking scheme that allows a mobile agent to track other multiple mobile agents. The distance, angle, and relative position is given in a direct target tracking output. This allows the mobile agent to decide which information is best suited for the particular objective

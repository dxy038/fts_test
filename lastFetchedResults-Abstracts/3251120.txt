This paper presents a fully-integrated bidirectional SC ladder converter in 0.13&#956;m 1.2V/3.3V triple-well CMOS with peak output voltage of ~10V. The converter actively drives a 5nF mm-sized piezo-electric robotic wing while following &lt;;500Hz arbitrary waveforms at ~3x step-up conversion. High voltage drive signals for the power switches are developed using a new voltage-distributed nested-bootstrapping technique for full range bidirectionality. Peak efficiency is 77% at ~800&#956;W load with 9V output.

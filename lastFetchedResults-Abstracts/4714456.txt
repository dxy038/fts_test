The objective of this paper is to present the design, analytical modeling and performance evaluation of a flat surfaced robotic gripper designed to automate the process of reliable, rapid and distortion-free limp material handling. The geometric model of the gripper and its grasp stability are analyzed leading to justification of the overall system design. The paper reviews the existing state-of-the-art technology in limp material handling, and presents the design and modeling of the robotic gripper system. Finally, the experimental results are presented

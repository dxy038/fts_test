Increasing the bandwidth or bit rate in real-time video applications to improve the quality of images is typically impossible or too expensive. Postprocessing appears to be the most feasible solution because it does not require any existing standards to be changed. Markedly reducing blocking effects can increase compression ratios for a particular image quality or improve the quality with respect to the specific bit rate of compression. This paper proposes a novel deblocking algorithm based on three filtering modes in terms of the activity across block boundaries. By properly considering the masking effect of the human visual system, an adaptive filtering decision is integrated into the deblocking process. According to three different deblocking modes appropriate for local regions with different characteristics, the perceptual and objective quality are improved without over smoothing the image details or insufficient reducing the strong blocking effect on the flat region. According to the simulation results, the proposed method outperforms methods of deblocking MPEG-4 with respect to peak signal-to-noise ratios and computational complexity.

This paper discusses the electrical properties of the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis that revealed from the relationship between the electrical and physical measurements of the bacteria. It was found that the conductivity is proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the voltage. The results obtained from this study showed that it is possible to simulate the behavior of the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis using electrical circuit.

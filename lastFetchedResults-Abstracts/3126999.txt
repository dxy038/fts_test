In this paper, an approach for the biped walking pattern generation, inspired from a learning process of human walking from a child to an adult, is taken. When an infant grows up to a child, it gradually learns how to walk through trials and errors. Then, as a child grows up to an adult, the body size and weight become larger, and a walking pattern is changed from one of a child. The process is called mature gait. The objective of this paper is to analyze the nature of the mature gait and to investigate the applicability of the mature gait to generation of robot biped walking pattern. Out simulation results show that physical growth of the robot model helps speeding up a learning process of walking pattern generation.

W-band (75-110 GHz) is proposed nowadays as a valuable alternative to intensively-exploited Ku- and Ka-bands for high-speed transmission over satellite networks. In such a framework, some experiments are being carried out, which are targeted to verify the feasibility of exploitation of W-band for broadband service deployment. From a theoretical viewpoint, the large bandwidth availability and the scarce amount of interference typical of W-band should guarantee high capacities. Nevertheless, many crucial aspects are still to be carefully investigated, e.g., signal propagation issues, RF impairments, choice of modulation and coding, efficient antenna design, etc. In this paper, an overview is made on the low Earth orbit (LEO) nano-satellite mission in-orbit key-test and validation of W-band (IKNOW). IKNOW mission is an ongoing advanced feasibility study part of an Italian Space Agency Project, named W-band analysis and verification (WAVE), coordinated by the Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Rome ldquoTor Vergatardquo. The main objective of the IKNOW mission is to tackle some of the unexplored critical aspects concerning W-band satellite transmission. In such a perspective, IKNOW should be regarded as a ldquopilot mission,rdquo whose results will be used for a first uplink-downlink satellite channel characterization, in-orbit validation of W-band technology, and space qualification processes. This paper is focused on the research work carried out in a preliminary phase of the IKNOW study and will also consider a number of elements related to the mission configuration, payload architecture, link analysis, potential RF impairment factors, and atmospheric effects. Proposed analysis and preliminary results shown can provide to interested readers the basic guidelines that will drive the practical implementation of IKNOW mission, as well as the most relevant issues to be faced by future developers of W-band missions using small LEO satellites.

A new approach for the Bee Colony Optimization algorithm (BCO) for Type-1 and Type-2 Fuzzy Controller design is presented in this paper. The Bee Colony Optimization meta-heuristic belongs to the class of Nature-Inspired Algorithms. The main objective of the work is based on the main reasons for the optimization of Type-1 and Type-2 Fuzzy Controllers, specifically in tuning membership functions of the fuzzy controller for the benchmark problem known as the water tank. For the design of Type-1 and Type-2 Fuzzy Controllers in particular applications, the use of bio-inspired optimization methods have helped in the complex task of finding the appropriate values of the parameters and the structure of the fuzzy systems.

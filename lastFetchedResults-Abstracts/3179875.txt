Recently, as the demands for the environment-friendly, safety and convenience requirements of vehicles increase, electronic control systems are increasing rapidly. In particular, in systems that affect vehicle performance critically, efficient electronic control devices are simply essential. In accordance with such trend of technical development, this study was intended to establish a development environment for the ECU RCP(rapid control prototyping) method which can help develop ECUs to be installed in next generation future vehicles. Since the established ECU RCP developing environment develops ECUs by using model-based design process, this environment can test their performance or verify their logics from the early stages of the development. In order for the verification of the validity of the ECU RCP environment developed for such objective, the developed ECU RCP was applied in executing the HILS(Hardware In-the-Loop Simulation) of ABS(anti-lock brake system) a typical safety device of vehicle. Finally, the ECU RCP developing environment which was proposed and verified in this study is anticipated to solve the problems of development period and cost reduction the challenges that system engineers face by helping the engineers more flexibly and organically innovate the existing process of ECU development that has been done sequentially individually.

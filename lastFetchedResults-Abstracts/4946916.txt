Human observers can easily assess the quality of a distorted image without examining the original image as a reference. By contrast, designing objective No-Reference (NR) quality measurement algorithms is a very difficult task. Currently, NR quality assessment is feasible only when prior knowledge about the types of image distortion is available. This research aims to develop NR quality measurement algorithms for JPEG compressed images. First, we established a JPEG image database and subjective experiments were conducted on the database. We show that Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which requires the reference images, is a poor indicator of subjective quality. Therefore, tuning an NR measurement model towards PSNR is not an appropriate approach in designing NR quality metrics. Furthermore, we propose a computational and memory efficient NR quality assessment model for JPEG images. Subjective test results are used to train the model, which achieves good quality prediction performance.

This paper studies the optimal planning of a renewable based energy supply plan for a residential building. It has been assumed that the building involves a platform equipped with smart communication and metering infrastructures, recalling the smart home (SH) concept. The best economically optimal model is choosed in each case based on the net present cost (NPC) and the cost of energy (COE) criteria. Mutual effects of the inflation rate uncertainty, project life-time span and a comparative model to study the use of combined heat and power (CHP) technology on the objective function have been modelled. An economic index related to environmental issues and one related to the thermal load supply have been defined and analysed. Finally a conclusion has been done according to results achieved throughout the study.

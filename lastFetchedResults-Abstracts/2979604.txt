A method of fuzzy data recall using polynomial bidirectional hetero-correlator is presented. This has a higher capacity for pattern pair storage than that of the conventional BAMs and fuzzy memories. In addition, a new energy function is defined. The polynomial bidirectional hetero-correlator (PBHC) takes advantage of fuzzy characteristics in evolution equations such that the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) of data recall is significantly increased. The energy of the polynomial bidirectional hetero-correlator defined by the proposed energy function decreases as the recall process proceeds, ensuring the stability of the system. The increase of SNR consequently enhances the capacity of the polynomial bidirectional hetero-correlator. Theoretical expectation value of the capacity of fuzzy data recall using polynomial bidirectional hetero-correlator is also estimated

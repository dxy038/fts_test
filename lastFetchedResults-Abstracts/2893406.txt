The Multi-radio Multi-channel Wireless Mesh Networks (MRMC WMNs) are a kind of networks that provide high speed connections for clients. These networks include some mesh routers that are stationary and each router has multiple radios. These radios can tune with different channels that cause improvement in throughput of network. Today numbers of clients that use multicast-based system such as video conferencing is increasing, so channel assignment in multicast routing such that decreasing interference is more important. On the other hand channel assignment and routing are dependent and it is better that these two process are integrated with each other. Thus we use a multi objective evolutionary algorithm to solve the problem &#8220;joint channel assignment and multicast routing in multi radio multi channel wireless mesh networks&#8221;. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance in terms of both total channels conflict and the tree cost than comparative reference.

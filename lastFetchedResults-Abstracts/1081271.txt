The objective of the study was to compare the treatment efficiency obtained with the MIEX®DOC process and ultrafiltration as well as to investigate the effect of MIEX®DOC water pretreatment on the performance of ultrafiltration membranes. The influence of MIEX® resin dose and membrane cut-off on natural organic matter removal (NOM) efficiency was analyzed.

Based on obtained results it might be stated that magnetic ion-exchange resin MIEX® is very effective in NOM separation from natural waters. For resin dose equal to 15 mL/L the reduction of abs 254 nm reached 90% for model solution and 80% for Odra river water. For UF membranes, their cut-off significantly influenced the NOM retention coefficient. The use of MIEX®DOC, process prior to ultrafiltration, increased permeate quality, especially for high MWCO membranes. Even very low MIEX® resin doses, significantly improved final water quality.

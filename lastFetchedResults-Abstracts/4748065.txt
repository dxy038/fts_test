With new global demands for better quality of software products, effective and efficient SQE (Software Quality Evaluation) becomes necessary and indispensible. Existing methods of SQE are as it is, however, subjective, non-quantitative and uncompleted to some extent. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, an improved AHPM (Analytic Hierarchy Process Model) incorporated traditional AHPM and some quality characteristics from ISO/IEC 9126, which attempts to propose a better method of software quality evaluation that is relatively objective, quantitative and completed. On this basis, current software can be well assessed as well as future products can be well predicted.

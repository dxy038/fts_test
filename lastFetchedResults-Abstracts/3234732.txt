The objective of this effort was to discover patterns of success in the systems engineering of information-intensive systems in a government acquisition environment using the method of positive deviance. Thirty government programs were identified, each with some notable success in the acquisition of IT-intensive capabilities. Twelve were selected for extensive follow-up and analysis, including detailed interviews with front-line practitioners who cope with the demands of the government acquisition system and are in a position to influence or observe positive deviance in their environment. This paper describes two large-scale success patterns that were observed, each with several recurring sub-patterns. &#8220;Balancing the Supply Web&#8221; addresses &#8220;social&#8221; interdependencies among enterprise stakeholders who have different equities in the capability being developed. &#8220;Harnessing Technical Complexity&#8221; addresses the technical interdependencies among system components that together deliver an operational capability for the enterprise. The large-scale patterns are two sides of the same coin. The programs studied achieved success because of the way they each navigated through these dual interdependencies.

Objective: Crocin, as an active constituent of saffron, has many biological functions including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of crocin and chlorpheniramine on local edema induced by histamine.
Materials and Methods: Local edema was induced by subcutaneous injection of histamine (100 ?l, 0.1%) in ventral surface of right hind paw. The thickness of paw was measured at 1 h before and 1, 2, 3 h after injection of histamine, using a fine caliper. The number of neutrophils in paw tissue sections was counted 3 h after intraplantar injection of histamine.
Results: Intraperitoneal injection of crocin at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg and chlorpheniramine at a dose of 10 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05) decreased both paw thickness and infiltration of neutrophils in paw tissues. In a combined treatment, intraperitoneal injection of an effective dose of crocin (100 mg/kg) with an ineffective dose of chlorpheniramine (2.5 mg/kg) produced a more documented response in comparison with crocin (100 mg/kg) and chlorpheniramine (2.5 mg/kg) used alone.
Conclusion: The results suggested that both crocin and chlorpheniramine suppressed histamine-induced local paw edema. Moreover, histamine H1 receptors function may be affected by crocin.

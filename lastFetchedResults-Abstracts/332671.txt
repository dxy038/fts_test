Objective
To measure the instant whitening effect delivered immediately after brushing with a novel silica whitening toothpaste containing blue covarine.
Methods

A controlled, single blind, cross-over study was performed to compare the tooth colour measured in a group of subjects at baseline and immediately after brushing with a silica whitening toothpaste containing blue covarine versus a clear gel negative control toothpaste. Measurements of tooth colour were made using a mobile non-contact camera-based digital imaging system and expressed as CIELAB and WIO whiteness index.
Results

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that the silica whitening toothpaste containing blue covarine was significantly more effective than the negative control toothpaste (p < 0.05), and made teeth measurably less yellow, less red and overall whiter immediately after brushing.
Conclusion

A statistically significant reduction in tooth yellowness and improvement in tooth whiteness was measured immediately after brushing with a novel whitening toothpaste containing blue covarine.

Objective
This study examined morphological changes of the ovine cervix in response to sex steroids using confocal microscopy.
Study design
Experimental animals were ovariectomized, and the hormonal status of 4 groups of ewes (n = 5) was manipulated using sex steroids (no replacement, estradiol, progesterone, estradiol, and progesterone). The results were correlated with control ewes (n = 7) in naturally occurring reproductive states (estrus and midluteal).
Results
Plasma progesterone concentrations of experimental animals were comparable with those observed during normal reproduction. Confocal microscopy enabled subcellular resolution of the cervical epithelium and the detection of morphological changes associated with alterations in progesterone and estradiol in both artificially manipulated and naturally cycling ewes. Differences in nuclear size, distribution, and density could be differentiated in confocal images and histologic sections of ectocervix from animals in estrus and in the presence of exogenous estradiol.
Conclusion
Confocal microscopy has potential diagnostic value for the detection of cellular and subcellular changes of the cervical epithelium.

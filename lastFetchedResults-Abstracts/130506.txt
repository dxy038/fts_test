The amount of investment in any economy depends on a number of invariables one of the most important of which is the security of investment. The amount of investment and the causes of lack of security for investing can be viewed from two sides:
1. The objective approach to security in which attempts are made to underline the objective invariables which indicate how efficient the institutions responsible for maintaining security are.
2. The subjective approach to security in which attempts are made to realize the degree of security in a country, the causes of lack of security, the influence of each of these causes on marketing in general. In order to be able to form an idea about all this, the actual investors are interviewed. The logical idea of investigating security through this approach is to provide investors with a subjective view of how safe it is to invest so that they can decide without feeling worried.

In this paper, the stability and locomotion of the lunar rover on a slope is studied. Based on the analysis of a single wheelÂ´s force model and the mechanism constraints of ldquoRocker-Bogierdquo suspension, the quasi-static model of the rover is derived. The objective function for optimal solution of the driving forces of the wheels is introduced taken into account the characteristic of the quasi-static model and the demand of coordinate actuation of the wheels. The stability and the locomotion performance of the rover are analyzed by analyzing the simulation results. The study of this paper can provide theoretical basis for torque control of the wheels.

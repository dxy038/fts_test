This paper studies the disruption management problem of rapid transit rail networks. We consider an integrated model for the recovery of the timetable and the rolling stock schedules. We propose a new approach to deal with large-scale disruptions: we limit the number of simultaneous schedule changes as much as possible, and we control the length of the recovery period, in addition to the traditional objective criteria such as service quality and operational costs. Our new criteria express two goals: the recovery schedules can easily be implemented in practice, and the operations quickly return to the originally planned schedules after the recovery period. We report our computational tests on realistic problem instances of the Spanish rail operator RENFE and demonstrate the potential of this approach by solving different variants of the proposed model.

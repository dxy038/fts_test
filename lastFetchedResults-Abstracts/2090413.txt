The current density σ as a limit technological factor affecting the aberrations of magnetic objective lenses, has been studied. A practical form of Tretner's (optik 16 (1959) 155) aberration parameters, in terms of current density σ, have been suggested. Iron-free lenses were compared with ironpole-piece lenses.

Assigning the airport gate with high efficiency is a key task among the airport ground busywork. As the core of airport operation, aircraft gate assignment is known as a kind of complicated combinatorial optimization problem. This paper proposed robust assignment model to minimize the overall variance of slack time. According to the intrinsic characteristics of the objective function itself, a Tabu search algorithm and meta-heuristic method is given to solve the gate assignment problem and the numerical simulations are mode. The experimental results show that the meta-heuristic TS and random algorithm TS to compare the results, with improvement of 60.63%, thereby validate the meta-heuristic method and TS in the airport gate assignment problem of model application is feasible and efficient.

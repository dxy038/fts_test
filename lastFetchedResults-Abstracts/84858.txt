We propose a novel network architecture for wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical networks which can provide bidirectional 1:1 protection against any fiber cut between the remote node and the optical network units (ONUs). In case of such fiber cut, the affected ONU can still communicate with the optical line terminal by rerouting the wavelength channels via the adjacent ONU.

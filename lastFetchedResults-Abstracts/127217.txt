BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Severe cases of vernal keratoconjunctivitis can reduce visual acuity due to corneal involvement. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low- dose topical mitomycin- c in patients with severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis refractory (SVKC) to conventional treatment.
METHODS: This clinical trial was performed on 36 refractory cases of SVKC. All of the patients were using corticosteroid and mast cell stabilizer before they entered this study but their symptoms and signs were persistent. Topical mitomycin - c 0.01% was used in both eyes of 18 patients for 14 days. The other patients (18 cases) was used saline normal drop. The symptoms and signs were checked on the day of enrollment and were compared at the end of first and second weeks. All of the patients were follow up 4 week post treatment for required additional medication.
FINDINGS: There was a significant decrease in all the symptoms and signs after 2 weeks of treatment. Only papillary reaction was persistent despite treatment in 14 cases. Drug toxicity was observed in two eyes manifesting as punctate keratitis. None of the patients required any other medication during the 4 weeks post treatment,
CONCLUSION: Short-term, low-dose mitomycin-c may be considered in the acute exacerbation periods of patients with SVKC refractory to conventional treatment.

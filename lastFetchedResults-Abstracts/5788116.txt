In this paper we investigate a novel distributed channel allocation method for cognitive radio networks (CRNs), which is based on a grid quorum system. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, the paper studies a grid-based quorum arrangement, also used by power saving protocols. Second, it proposes two channel mapping methods based on a grid quorum and sub-grids. Each node visits channels according to its channel map (sequence) and without exchange of any information, which reduces signaling overhead. The study shows that nodes do not need to be dependent on the existence of a common control channel (CCC), synchronization or a central controller, as it is frequently assumed in the current CR literature.

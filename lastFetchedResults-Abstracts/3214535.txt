Recent development of power electronics introduces the use of flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) controllers in power systems. These devices are helping to performance of power system especially when power system supports unbalanced loads. One of the most important of FACTS devices is unified power flow controller based on matrix converter (UPFC-MC) which space vector modulation (SVM) technique is used to control its nine-bidirectional switches. This paper presents two control methods for UPFC-MC under unbalanced power system. These control methods are suggested to improve transmission lines power flows. The validity of the proposed control methods are reconfirmed by simulation results.

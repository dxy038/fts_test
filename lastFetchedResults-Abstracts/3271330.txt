This paper proposes two processes for merging Thai Herb information obtained from heterogeneous data sources. The objective is to combine different formats of Thai herb information into one consistent representation. The processes are implemented in a Sourcing and Merging Agent (SMA) of a Multi-Agent Thai Herb Recommendation system (MA_THR). The first process aims to find and merge the same Thai herb with different names. The second process aims to find synonyms of symptoms. Experiments give 93% accuracy of merging Thai herb information using names and 97% accuracy of finding the similarity between symptoms.

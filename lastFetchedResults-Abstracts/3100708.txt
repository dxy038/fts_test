It is vital to build and select structuring element in feature extraction based-on mathematical morphology. According to the character of the distributed spacecraft system, a feature extraction algorithm based-on dynamically structured element is proposed in this paper. The thought of this algorithm is summarized as follows: (1) firstly, approximate relative position and attitude is calculated according to the approximate attitude and orbital information of the spacecraft; (2) secondly, a structured element database is built according to the shape of the objective spacecraft and the result above; (3) thirdly, according to the results of (1) and (2), feature extraction is implemented based on dynamically re-structured element; (4) finally, the simulation results show that proposed algorithm is valid for the distributed spacecraft system.

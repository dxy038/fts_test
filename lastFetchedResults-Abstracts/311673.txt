Background
Biomechanical models have been used to study the plantar aponeurosis, medial arch height, subtalar motion, medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy, subtalar arthroereisis and the distribution of forces in the normal and flat foot. The objective was to examine the hypothesis that increased load on the medial arch in the adult flat foot can be reduced through a 10 mm lateral column lengthening calcaneal osteotomy 10 mm proximal from the calcaneal cuboid joint.
Methods

A three dimensional multisegment biomechanical model was used with anatomical data from a normal foot, a flat foot and a foot corrected with a 10 mm lateral column lengthening calcaneal osteotomy. The response of a normal foot, a flat foot and a flat foot with a 10 mm lateral column lengthening calcaneal osteotomy to an applied load of 683 N was analyzed using the biomechanical model. Data for the biomechanical model was obtained from a cadaver foot using the direct linear transformation method. Direct linear transformation uses multiple cameras to determine the spatial location of anatomical landmarks.
Findings

Load on the first metatarsal increases to 37% body weight in the flat foot compared to 12% for the normal foot and the moment about the talo-navicular joint increases from 5.6 N m to 21.6 N m. Lateral column lengthening shifts the load toward the lateral column, decreasing load on the first metatarsal to 10% and decreasing the moment about the talo-navicular joint to 8.1 N m.
Interpretation

The analysis shows that a 10 mm lateral column lengthening calcaneal osteotomy reduces the excess force on the medial arch in an adult flat foot and adds biomechanical rationale to this clinical procedure.

The purpose of this articles is quantitatively evaluate the wave climate variations of the northern Sicilian coasts. In particular, the objective of the study is Castellammare del Golfo, a marine site between Trapani and Palermo. In particular in this research, the wave energy of the Sicily has been studied by an analysis of wave data carried out in a 10- year period, using the measurements of buoyant of RON. The northwestern and southern coasts of Sicily have a lower potential with average wave power ranging between 2.5 and 6.5 kW/m.

3D video is currently attracting increasing interest, as it provides users greatly enhanced viewing experience. For such applications, multi-view video coding is crucial to handle the enormous amount of data. In this paper, an experimental analysis of multi-view video coding for various temporal and inter-view prediction structures is presented. We demonstrate the correlations among temporal and inter-view, show different hierarchical B pictures prediction structures, and describe the advantage of several multi-view video coding prediction schemes. The experiment is based on block matching and multi-reference prediction technique in the H.264/AVC video coding standard. For several test sequences, results including objective and subjective evaluation are shown which indicate that the amount of spatial prediction across different camera views can be increased by applying hierarchical B pictures.

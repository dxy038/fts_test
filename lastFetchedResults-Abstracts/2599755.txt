Research and developmentexpenditure (R&D) in new literature plays an important role in economic growth. Investment in R&D, increases level of knowledge and enhanced knowledge, increase production efficiency and from efficiency channel economic growth improves. Many studies have been done on the R&D not used unit of data for this variable. This is due to a lack of labor and the level of investment in R&D (because of the complexity of calculations and measurements of this invisible variable).In this study, the series of capital and labor at different periods in the R&D was calculated and then the level of knowledge is considered as an unobservable variable in the production. We develop a multi objective recursive algorithm and estimated the level of knowledge series value during 1974-2013.These calculations by the authors can be very important for future studies in field of R&D. It should be noted that all the programming of recursive algorithm developed by the authors in MATLAB software. And can be expanded for different countries.

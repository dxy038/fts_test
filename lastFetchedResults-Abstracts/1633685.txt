The objective of this study was to determine the preliminary characteristics and protective effects of alfalfa polysaccharides (APS) on hepatocytes in vitro. The crude APS was purified by DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100 chromatography, resulting in the four purified fractions: APS-1, APS-2, APS-3 and APS-4. The results indicated that APS-3 had higher carbohydrate and uronic acid contents and that APS-4 had a more complicated monosaccharide composition compared to the other purified fractions. The average molecular weights of APS-1, APS-2, APS-3 and APS-4 were 48,536, 6,221, 66,559 and 13,076 Da, respectively. Furthermore, APS (crude and its purified fractions) restored the activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased the total antioxidant capacity of hepatocytes subjected to H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, APS treatment counteracted the increases in lactic dehydrogenase and malonaldehyde in the culture supernatant. These results clearly demonstrate that APS possesses a protective effect against oxidative injury in hepatocytes.

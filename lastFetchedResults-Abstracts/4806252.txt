This paper is based on the results of flight testing on the air data systems of two general aviation aircraft performed by the USAF Test Pilot School. The objective was to compare data collected from commercial GPS receivers to data from classical pitot-static calibration flight test techniques. The results showed that GPS receivers can be used for air data system calibrations even with selective availability active

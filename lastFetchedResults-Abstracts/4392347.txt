Energy crisis along with environmental concerns are some principal motivations for replacing centralized power systems with Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). In this respect, Combined Cooling, Heating and Power systems (CCHPs) play a critical role in improving the system efficiency as well as reducing cost and emission. In this paper, an optimal energy management strategy is proposed to take full advantage of a hybrid CCHP and PV system. For this purpose, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is applied on a typical residential building to minimize both Energy cost and emission. Evaluating the proposed strategy, three scenarios are considered: the building without Energy Storage Devices (ESDs) following thermal or electric load, and the building incorporating both Electrical and Thermal Energy Storage. Simulation results indicate the effect of embedding ESDs in the proposed hybrid system.

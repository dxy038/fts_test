The major objective of this work is to conceive a new energy process to improve energy efficiency on small buildings. This main goal will be accomplished through a new hybrid model for energy and environmental sustainability based on efficient technologies to reduce energy consumption, supported, particularly, in the gasification cogeneration technology in a context of decentralized energy production. In this paper we report a technical and economical study aimed to reduce energy demands throughout the use of renewable energy sources, in particular solar and biomass, for heating, cooling and electricity production. The chosen path to reach this objective includes the use of a cogeneration biomass gasification system and a PV system as a hybrid and autonomous energy model. The model is applied to a specific case study (a small hotel) with the aim to improve the energy efficiency of the building. Another goal is to achieve the best energetic rating classification for the building (low energy consumption building). This is a low cost and energy supply model that allows a rational use of energy sources. Locally, this technology is a new development paradigm and allows, itself, a wide range of commercial, industrial and individual applications. For an efficient implementation of the integrated hybrid energy system, the consumption of electricity, gas, fuel and water were monitored through the last seven years. Thus, several passive energy actions were implemented, leading to improve efficiency of the structure of the building envelope and save energy resources.

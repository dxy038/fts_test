In this paper, we proposed a reference-free (RF) objective measurement algorithm for the digital video signals of multimedia communication. With the statistical analysis, we utilized the important feature vectors (FVs) which have high relationships with the subjective perceptual quality of digital video sequences. After considering the fundamentality and force of these FVs, we combined them with different weighted coefficients to build an ideal video quality measurement algorithm. With our simulation results, the proposed method exhibits its significant function for video quality measurement (VQM). It can give a high correlation with the subjective perceptual video quality score. And because of its low computational complexity, it can be used to the real-time multimedia communication systems.

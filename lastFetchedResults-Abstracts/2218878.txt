Background: Noise pollution has increased to alarming extent in most of the urban areas in Pakistan. It is assumed
even more perilous than air and water pollution due to its direct acute and chronic physio-psychological effects.
The objective of this study is to analyze and evaluate the psychological and physiological effects caused by traffic
noise on traffic wardens and to find relation type between exposure time and effect.
Methods: Three wardens check posts near roads were selected for survey in Taxila and Islamabad cities of Pakistan.
Survey conducted included noise measurements at aforementioned check posts for one month and Performa
based interviews of traffic wardens.
Results and conclusions: Analysis of results showed that noise levels varied between 85-106 dB hence violating
OSHA regulations. Major psychological effects found in wardens were aggravated depression 58%, stress 65%,
public conflict 71%, irritation and annoyance 54%, behavioral affects 59% and speech interference 56%. Physiological
effects found were hypertension 87%, muscle tension 64%, exhaustion 48%, low performance levels 55%, concentration
loss 93%, hearing impairment 69%, headache 74% and cardiovascular issue 71%. Relation between exposure time
and effects were evaluated by using simple regression test in excel. Percentage of psychological and physiological
effects in wardens varied with the exposure time; aggravated depression (R2 = 0.946, P = 0.133), stress suffering
(R2 = 0.014, P = 0.173), public conflict (R2 = 0.946, P = 0.133), irritation and annoyance (R2 = 0.371, P = 0.137), behavioral
affects (R2 = 0.596, P = 0.0616) and speech interference (R2 = 0.355, P = 0.445), hypertension (R2 = 0.96, P = 0.00095) and
cardiovascular issue (R2 = 0.775, P = 0.044).

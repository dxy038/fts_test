Lower limb edema may occur after removal of the saphenous veins in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Compression therapy is often used to prevent postoperative edema. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of medical compression stockings (TED) on the prevention of donor limbs edema and wound complications after CABG surgery. In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 100 patients who underwent elective CABG surgery at Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research Center. The patients were divided into two groups; group A who applied TED stockings regularly (exposure group) and group B who did not apply TED stockings at all or apply it irregularly (no exposure group). The degree of donor limb edema and the differences of the peripheries of calf and thigh before and after the surgery (in 1, 2 and 4 weeks) were recorded and analyzed statistically. The patients&#039; weight (P = 0.02) and the degree of their daily activity (P = 0.002) were the significant factors for the incidence of the donor limbs edema. The incidence and degree of lower limb edema were significantly lower in exposure group 4 weeks after the surgery (P &lt; 0.001). The differences of the periphery of the calf before (at admission time) and after the surgery (in 1, 2 and 4 weeks) between two groups were also statistically significant (P = 0.41, P = 0.39, P = 0.40, respectively). Lower limb wound complications was higher in patients who have peripheral edema in the 4th week of post-CABG (P = 0.09). Regular use of TED stockings may have positive effects on the prevention of donor limb edema (especially higher degrees of edema) and wound complications after CABG surgery.

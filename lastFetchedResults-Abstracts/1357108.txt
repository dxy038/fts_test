Background: Medicinal plant extracts such as those obtained
from Salvia species have a wide variety of chemical compounds
in their essential oils. The repellency of a number of essential
oils including those from the labiates like Salvia against several
insect species including the common house flies is reported.
Objective: The aim of this investigation was to find out the
excito-repellency effects of Salvia sclarea L. (Lamiaceae)
extracts against adult house flies, Musca domestica L. (Diptera:
Muscidae).
Methods: Air-dried plant material from the aerial parts of S.
sclarea was subjected to hydro-distillation in a Clevenger type
glass apparatus model Soxhlet with acetone, benzene, petroleum
ether, chloroform, and aqueous solvents. Only adult house flies
were inserted into an exposure chamber and their behavior was
monitored for feeding tendency, repellency rate and deterrence
rate. Statistical analyses were carried out by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with computation of the significance of
differences in the outcome of various treatments.
Results: There were significant differences among most of the
various extracts with their controls in the sequential effects of
feeding (P=0.04), deterrent (P=0.023) and repellency (P=0.01)
rates of house flies. The order of potency for various extracts
with a concentration of 100 g/l was as follows: petroleum ether > 
benzene >  water >  acetone >  chloroform.
Conclusion: It is thus conceivable to search for native means of
combating house flies by fractionating the active ingredients in
the Clary sage in the light of its excito-repellency effects.

A comparative analysis of transmit diversity and beamforming systems, using outage capacity as performance measure, is presented. The objective is to examine the effect of angle-of-arrival (AOA) distributions on two systems with angle spread. This is done by comparing the performance of transmit diversity with a system that uses beamforming to point a relatively narrow beam at the mobile station. Results show that the transmit diversity system, using uniform linear arrays with truncated Laplacian AOA, always performs better, even at smaller angle spreads, as compared to other energy distributions.

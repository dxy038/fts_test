To get the best-possible performance from exit wave reconstruction from focal series in TEM, it is important to make the correct choices for the number of images, their defocus values and the electron dose distribution over the series. In this paper an objective measure for the quality of the experimental design is presented. Based on this measure it is possible to compare different experimental designs and also to define what is the optimal experimental design. Simple design rules for obtaining the optimal set-up are given.

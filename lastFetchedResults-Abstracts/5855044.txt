With the advent of digital times, the digital data has gradually taken the place of the original analog data. However, the authenticity of digital data faces a great challenge due to the fact that the digital edit software is ubiquitous. It has aroused the suspicion on the reliability of digital data especially when the digital data renders to the court as the digital evidence. We propose an integrated image authentication system for digital forensics and improve the detection problems of a DCT quantization-based image authentication scheme. The improved detection schemes effectively solve the detection problems and, at the same time, take into account the reliability, the security, and the practicability of the system. It is expected to reduce the wrong detection probability of the digital evidence. Finally, the improved image authentication schemes are implemented. If the digital evidence presented to the court is under suspicions, the system is expected to provide accurate information to help the judiciary to make the verdict right and objective.

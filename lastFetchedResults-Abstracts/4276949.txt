The paper discusses a detailed comparative study between civilian EMC immunity standards, IEC 61000-4-series and automotive EMC immunity standards, SAE J1113-series. The objective of this paper is to find out major differences between these two important EMC immunity standards and the reasons behind them. Generally automotive EMC immunity standards (SAE J1113 - series) are more stringent than civilian EMC immunity standards (IEC 61000-4-series), due to the direct human safety aspects involved in the usage of automobiles. This is explained with more detail in the paper. The paper highlights the important deviations in the test specification of the following civilian EMC immunity standards (IEC 61000-4-series) and automotive EMC immunity standards (SAE J1113-series): (i) IEC 61000-4-2, 1998 and SAE J1113-13, OCT 1997, for electrostatic discharge (ESD) immunity test; (ii) IEC 61000-4-3, 1998 and SAE J1113-21, JAN 1998, for radiated radio frequency electromagnetic field immunity test; and (iii) IEC 61000-4-8, 1993 and SAE J1113-22, OCT 1996, for radiated power frequency magnetic field immunity test.

Inroduction & Objective:Pike(Esox Lucius) is one of the important economical fish in Caspian Sea region which is living in areas such as wetlands and rivers in which covered with aquatic plants. The reproduction of this fish naturally occurs in freshwater ecosystems. The aim of this study was the investigation in ovarian development stages of pike broodstocks, which is the important indicator for fish reproduction biology and also there is little documents available about it.Histological pictures were employed for growth survey and evolution of gonads in pike.
Materials and Methods: In order to histology and determination of sexual maturation stages, 50 ovaries were studied. Fixed Samples were studied by light microscope.
Results:The sexual maturation stages showed that ovaries of pikes were in stages II (spring and summer), III (summer and autumn), IV and V (winter). Also, the highest value of absolute fecundity determined as much as 13609.347 in autumn and the highest value of Gonadosomatic index determined as much as 4.063 at the first half of winter. 
Conclusion: The results showed that pike is spawning at once.

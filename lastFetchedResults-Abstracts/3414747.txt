The temperature-sensitive magnetic semiconductor (TMS) is a multifunctional sensor with thermistor and thyratron-type bidirectional diode functions in a temperature-sensitive magnetic core. In the TMS, capacity and resistance are humidity dependent and they decrease with rising humidity. The temperature dependence of the magnetic reluctance is independent of humidity. The current-voltage characteristics show a bidirectional non-linear conduction phenomena which covers three states; a cut off state, a negative resistance state and an on state. The application of the TMS for utilization as a versatile temperature/humidity measurement module is shown.

This work describes a rapid method to correct the two-fold astigmatism of transmission electron microscope (TEM) objective lens employing caustic curve when no objective aperture is inserted. The method makes use of rounding the caustic curve via the objective lens stigmators after the condenser lens astigmatism has been corrected. It has many advantages over other methods, it is fast, straightforward, and does not need holes or an amorphous material.

This paper presents a model for teaching Heuristic Evaluation in a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course. The course objective is to teach students to design HCI as an approach to develop usable software. The students are involved in the process of the Heuristic Evaluation to learn to address usability problems as a part of an iterative design process. The evaluation supports other course objectives: combine theoretical knowledge as usability principles, interaction design patterns with practical experience obtained through project work. Student achievements and assessment are presented indicating the assignment results.

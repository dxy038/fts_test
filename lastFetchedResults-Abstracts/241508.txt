The objective of this paper is to present thermodynamic properties and characteristics of the binary refrigerant mixtures R 32/R 134a in compositions 20/80%, 30/70%, 40/60% by mass and of the ternary mixture R 407b: 10 wt% R 32+70 wt% R 125+20 wt% R 134a. A computer code has been developed and by use of a Pengâ€“Robinson type equation of state, PVT data for all working fluids are determined. Based on the thermodynamics theory, analytical relationships for the enthalpy, entropy, constant pressure and constant volume specific heats as well as for k-type isentropic change exponents are given. Furthermore, comparisons are provided by means of diagrams illustrating the influence of state conditions on the k-type exponents kp,V, kT,V, kp,T, and classical k (k=cP/cV). A systematic study has also been carried out and the data obtained are plotted for a better physical feeling related to the sound velocity of real gas for the R 32/R 134a blend in composition 20/80%. The results are compared with corresponding ones of the ternary R 407b.

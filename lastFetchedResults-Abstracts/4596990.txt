High-voltage vacuum circuit breakers in transmission voltage, as their environmental friendly characteristics, are drawing more and more interests all over the world. The objective of this paper is to present experimental results of type-test for a 126kV/40kA-2500A single-break vacuum circuit breaker based on a standard of IEC 62271-100. Two kinds of test circuits were adopted in type tests for the 126kV/40kA-2500A single-break vacuum circuit breaker. One is direct test circuit for test duties such as out of phase making and breaking test duties OP1 and OP2. The other is synthetic circuit for test duties, such as terminal fault test, capacitive current switching test, short-line fault test, out-of -phase test, double earth test and electrical endurance test. Type-test results, for the 126kV vacuum circuit breaker, presented in this paper are as follows: Dielectric test, 230kV 1min power frequency voltage withstand test and lightning impulse voltage withstand test, with 15 times 550kV in both of polarities; Short time withstand current with 4s duration and peak withstand current test with 100kA; Terminal fault test, including test duties: T10, T30, T60, T100s, T100a; Out of phase making and breaking test, including OP1 and OP2; Short-line fault test L90 and L75; Double-earth fault test as well as capacitive current switching tests of class C1 with test duties of LC1, CC1 and LC2, CC2; Electrical endurance tests; And assessment of condition after test with a 80%of dielectric test voltage; Temperature rise test under rated current of 2500A; Mechanical endurance test of class M1. In summary, the 126kV/40kA-2500A single-break circuit breaker passed the type tests.

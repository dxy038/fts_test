Objective
luate the effect of sodium hypochlorite pretreatment on adhesion to normal and caries-affected dentin using self-etch adhesives.
s
extracted human molars with coronal carious lesions were used in this experiment. The occlusal dentin surfaces including the caries-affected dentin in each group were treated as follows: group 1, rinsed with water; group 2, treated with 6% NaOCl for 15 s; group 3, treated with 6% NaOCl for 30 s; group 4, application with Accel for 30 s after NaOCl-30 s pretreatment. After rinsing with water and air-drying, the treated dentin surfaces were applied with self-etch systems (Bond Force and Clearfil Protect Bond) according to the manufacturers’ instructions, and built-up with resin composite. After 37 °C water storage for 24 h, the bonded normal or caries-affected dentin areas were isolated to create an hourglass configuration with a cross-sectional area of approximately 1 mm2. The specimens were subjected to tensile stress at a cross-head speed of 1.0 mm/min.
s
15 s pretreatment significantly improved the μTBS of both self-etch adhesives to caries-affected dentin, while the 30 s pretreatment did not affect them. For normal dentin, NaOCl-30 s pretreatment significantly reduced the μTBS of both self-etch adhesives although the 15 s pretreatment did not alter them. Furthermore, the application of Accel with a reducing effect increased the μTBS to normal and caries-affected dentin treated with NaOCl for 30 s.
sions
fects of NaOCl pretreatment on bonding of both self-etch adhesives were dependent upon type of dentin (normal and caries-affected dentin) and the treatment time.

Experimental verification of a recently developed algorithm, sliding mode control with perturbation estimation (SMCPE), is performed, a two-axes planar SCARA type robot is used as the test platform. The controller is a PC-based microprocessor with transducer and actuator interfaces. The objective of trajectory tracking is achieved by directly controlling the joint torques, despite the modeling deficiencies and unknown disturbances. Two major practical issues are considered. One of them is the measurement noise and the other is the hard/software limitations on the control loop closure speed. Both of these issues affect the parametric selections with the SMCPE algorithm. A sample test result is presented, to compare the performance of SMCPE with the classical SMC

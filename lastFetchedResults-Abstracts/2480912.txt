In this paper, the adaptive second order sliding mode (SOSM) controller is designed for two input - two output (TITO) uncertain nonlinear systems and the robustness properties are ensured in the presence of uncertainties and bounded external disturbances. The objective is to design a controller that ensures stability and path tracking despite the effects of coupling. To this end, the system model is divided into two subsystems, and the coupling effects between such subsystems are considered as uncertainties. The sliding mode approach with PI sliding surface is used to remove the offset and converge the steady state error to zero. To avoid chattering phenomenon, Second order sliding mode method is proposed. Using adaptive switching gain, a new method is presented which unlike other methods, does not require the upper bound of the system uncertainties in the design procedure. Robustness properties against system uncertainties and external disturbances are  shown by the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, the proposed method is used to control azimuth and elevation angle of  a laboratory helicopter with two degrees of freedom. Simulation results show performance of the algorithm in the presence of perturbations.

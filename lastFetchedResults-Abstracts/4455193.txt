The objective of this paper is to outline a methodology for the computation of the response of a multiconductor transmission line terminated by linear networks. The lines are embedded in a multilayered lossy dielectric media and have arbitrary cross sections, but uniform along the length. To check the accuracy of the theoretical results, extensive experimental verification has been carried out.

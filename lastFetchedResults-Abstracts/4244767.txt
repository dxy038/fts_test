Wireless sensor networks have many objectives to be addressed to. These objectives have to be satisfied in order to obtain sufficient excellence in the application of the wireless sensor networks. The multi-objective optimization method proves to be a very efficient tool in the application of these objectives in the wireless sensor fields. The multi-objective optimization methods are implemented onto the wireless networks and an observation is done so as to determine how the objectives are adhered to.

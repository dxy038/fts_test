The characteristics of two-phase flow in a narrow rectangular channel are expected to be different from those in other channel geometries, because of the significant restriction of the bubble shape which, consequently, may affect the heat removal by boiling under various operating conditions. The objective of this study is to develop an interfacial area transport equation with the sink and source terms being properly modeled for the gas–liquid two-phase flow in a narrow rectangular channel. By taking into account the crushed characteristics of the bubbles a new one-group interfacial area transport equation was derived for the two-phase flow in a narrow rectangular channel. The random collisions between bubbles and the impacts of turbulent eddies with bubbles were modeled for the bubble coalescence and breakup respectively in the two-phase flow in a narrow rectangular channel. The newly-developed one-group interfacial area transport equation with the derived sink and source terms was evaluated by using the area-averaged flow parameters of vertical upwardly-moving adiabatic air–water two-phase flows measured in a narrow rectangular channel with the gap of 0.993 mm and the width of 40.0 mm. The flow conditions of the data set covered spherical bubbly, crushed pancake bubbly, crushed cap-bubbly and crushed slug flow regimes and their superficial liquid velocity and the void fraction ranged from 0.214 m/s to 2.08 m/s and from 3.92% to 42.6%, respectively. Good agreement with the average relative deviation of 9.98% was obtained between the predicted and measured interfacial area concentrations in this study.

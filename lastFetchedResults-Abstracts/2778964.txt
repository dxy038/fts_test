This paper presents a new image-quality-based power control algorithm for an organic light-emitting diode display. The proposed algorithm calculates the optimal tradeoff between image quality and power consumption by employing an objective function that integrates a roll-off curve to eliminate the clipping error, which severely degrades the perceptual image quality. In addition, a sampling technique is adopted to reduce the computational complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the average power consumption by up to 0.310 &#215;10 <sup>9</sup> (11.75% decrease) while preserving the image quality above the target level. When applying the sampling technique to the proposed method, the average computation time per pixel is reduced by up to 1.025 &#956;s (37.63% decrease) whereas the image quality and power consumption remain virtually unchanged.

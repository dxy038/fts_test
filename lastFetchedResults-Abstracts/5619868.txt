In the spring of 2005 a limited objective experiment was carried out to assess the feasibility of using agent based simulations to enhance co-evolutionary course of action development. In particular, relatively low fidelity simulations were employed to visualize the results of particular courses of action. Over four days multiple courses of action were developed by two opposing teams with similar force structures and then run against one another in an agent based modeling environment to test their ability to achieve the given mission. The results of the experiment indicate that there is significant potential for low fidelity simulations to stimulate objective thinking in course of action development

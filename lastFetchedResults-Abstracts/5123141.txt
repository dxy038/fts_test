The Coupled Inductor Bidirectional DC-DC CI-BDC converter can help for the effective use of ESS due to its low voltage device stress, high voltage diversity and efficiency in nature. Thus, enables battery module of low voltage to be interfaced with the high-voltage dc bus or the micro grid for subsequent use. However, the convertersÂ´ inductor leakage energy problem limits their applications. The authors propose a simple voltage clamped CI-BDC converter which can effectively clamp the switch turn-off voltage spikes and totally recover the leakage energy. The voltage mode control of the proposed converter is also addressed in this paper. Simulation and experimental results are given for conceptual proof afforded by the proposed clamp circuit.

This paper describes the performance of a store-store-and-forward communications network with an adaptive routing strategy. The network chosen is a simplification of the AUTODIN network (described below) and the strategy is a modification of the routing of ARPANET. The objective is to make a network such as AUTODIN, with its wide variation in message length, effectively responsive for computercomputer and terminal-computer messages as well as record traffic. A second objective is to increase survivability following isolated equipment failures. A simulation study is used to show that improved performance is achieved.

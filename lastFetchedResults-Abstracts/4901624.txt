In order to obtain the minimum power losses of asynchronous motor when voltage regulation control is applied, the optimal voltage is calculated under different given torque. Comprehensive power loss is used as objective function considering the effect of reactive power in this paper. In addition, a cantilever equivalent circuit with precise parameter is applied to reclassify the power losses in motor, by which active and reactive power loss can both be expressed with load torque and voltage directly. Upon that, optimal voltage could be deduced with mechanical torque of load. Simulation and experimental results proved to be accordant with theoretical calculation.

Background: Applications of natural ingredients not only increase the shelf life of food but also omit the problems of synthetic preservatives compounds.
Objective: Cinnamon verum essential oil (CVEO; 0.05, 0.1, 0.15%) and Echinacea purpurea extract (EPE; 0.25, 0.5, 0.75%) were added to Kolompe (a traditional cookie in Kerman-Iran) and their antioxidant and antimicrobial effects were compared with the samples of BHA (100 and 200 ppm) and control (without any antioxidant).
Methods: Peroxide and tiobarbituric acid values (PV and TBA) and total count, mold, yeast, Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, Bacillus cereus, positive Staphylococci â€“coagulase were measured for antioxidant and antimicrobial assessment, respectively.
Results: PV and TBA values of control were more than others and antioxidant effect of CVEO-0.05 was similar to BHA-0.01 (p <  0.01). The least PV and TBA values were for CVEO-0.1. Application of EPE-0.25 was too led more antioxidant effect (increased by increasing %) than BHA-0.01. All samples lacked aerobic microorganism, yeast and mold except EPE-0.25 (that was the same with control) in 30th day. The number of these microorganisms in EPE-0.5 was lower than control, BHA-0.01 and BHA-0.02. No microorganism was in EPE-0.75 that expressed strong antimicrobial effect of this level extract. 
Conclusion: Antioxidant effects for CVEO-0.1, CVEO-0.25, EPE-0.1 and EPE-0.25 were more than BHA. With increasing of concentration, PV and TBA values for pro-oxidant effect increased. Application of CVEO and EPE in Kolompe was strong effect in microbial properties and increase the shelf life of Kolompe.

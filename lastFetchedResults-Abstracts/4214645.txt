In this paper, we introduce a novel capacity and power optimization algorithm with geographic based channel allocation scheme to an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based femtocell network. The proposed channel allocation scheme mainly reduces the interference between femto/macro cells. Moreover, optimal channels are allocated to users such that they communicate through the channels which have maximum normalized channel gain for them. Further, here we cooperatively optimize macrocell and femtocell uplink rate and power for each user since most of the work up to now considers resources in one scheme. Thus a joint approach is more reliable. As an optimization algorithm, non-cooperative game theory approach is introduced. Further, the objective function is defined as a capacity maximization with pricing as a monotonically increasing function with user power. Thus this algorithm optimizes both power and rate for all the users in the system.

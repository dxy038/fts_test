Introduction & Objective:  The amount of heavy metals in the environment has increased with human industrial interference and cause damage to the environment provides.Free of heavy metals are found in combination with other elements in the environment , and mineral waters. Effect of  lead chloride  on fish embryos that named (Pterophyllum   scalar)  is the aim of this study.Therefore, 5 pairs of ornamental fish of a species to determine the toxicity of lead chloride in the process of embryonic development (early life) before the eggs were extracted.
Materials and Methods:  In the first study to determine the acute toxicity LC50 concentration of the desired material (lead chloride) 5 concentration of 3 ?g/L, 5 ?g/L, 10 ?g/L and 20 ?g/L  and control was performed in three successive iterations .Each test was repeated for 3 days and counting the number of dead embryos (white) Acute toxicity of lead chloride at doses less than ?g/L  (5 ?g/L  ? n) was determined.In the second phase of research to examine  the changes desired effect of causing toxicity on fetal developmental stages of Angel fish were. Stages of the  test is less than the LC50 concentration of less than 4 were considered g/L?5. The concentrations of 5/0, 5/1, 3 and 5/4 g / L? and controls for comparison.Some of these samples at the same moment sampling survey was study with photo stereo microscope.
Results: The results showed that lead chloride in the initial review abnormally apparent like the tilt, loss of vision or the lack of effect on growth delay. Histological studies of tissues prepared for light microscopy study also showed that lead chloride on growth of embryonic kidney (Prenefroses) did not interfere.

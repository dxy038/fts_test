Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have an important role in modern computer games especially to make NPCs in games more human-like, believable and natural. In a real time warfare game, coordination of NPC troops can create a deeper sense of immersion. Anyhow, multi behavior NPC troops have intelligence for selecting their behavior itself which sometimes does not appropriate to accomplish a team objective. Therefore, in this research we propose to develop smart agent for team coordination to produce better team behavior. Fuzzy coordinator method is employed for team coordination based on smart agent as a leader in attacking scenario. The smart agent coordinates a team strategy with uncoordinated action from the NPC to produce coordinated action for each NPC. Gaussian distribution is used to make variation action of each NPC more natural and unpredictable. The experiment demonstrates the smart agent with fuzzy coordinator who becomes the leader can analyze attack time remaining, health of each NPC and enemy to decide which one has to offense or defense in battle by change decision of each NPC troop to select action that has contribution for team.

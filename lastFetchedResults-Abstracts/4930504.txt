Pulse of up to 1000 seconds with 0.5 MA plasma current is the main objective of EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) discharge experiments. For long duration discharge, real-time diagnostics is indispensable. To meet the requirement, a slice-based data acquisition system for long duration discharge has been designed and developed. This paper gives an overview of this system. The slice-based data acquisition system is based on time slice mechanism, which divides continuous experimental data into slices. And the time slice of data are transferred, stored, published in real-time while collecting data. Moreover, the introduction of multi-stage storage and time window greatly enhanced the speed of mass data access. The slice-based data acquisition system has been reliably operated in the EAST experimental campaigns.

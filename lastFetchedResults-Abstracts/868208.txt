This study develops a fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) model for solving the multi-product aggregate production planning (APP) decision problem in a fuzzy environment. The proposed model attempts to minimize total production costs, carrying and backordering costs and rates of changes in labor levels considering inventory level, labor levels, capacity, warehouse space and the time value of money. A numerical example demonstrates the feasibility of applying the proposed model to APP problem. Its advantages are also discussed. The proposed model yields a compromise solution and the decision maker's overall levels of satisfaction. In particular, in contrast to other APP models, several significant characteristics of the proposed model are presented.

DC distribution main consist of power electronics components and converter. Energy storage system is also required to maintain the voltage stable for DC bus. This paper discusses the structure of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) of battery and ultracapacitor. A new bidirectional DC-DC buck/boost converter used for energy transfer between DC bus and HESS is also analyzed in detail. It not only can operate bi-directionally, it can also provide three different working modes: buck, boost and buck-boost modes. The buck and boost mode can provide lower and higher voltage transfer ratio than traditional Buck and Boost converters respectively. Its buck-boost mode can provide positive output voltage. A cell balancing circuit with one center-tapped inductor and two active switches is also introduced in this paper. Its advantages of simple structure and energy fast-transferring make it more suitable for ultracapacitor string. Experimental and simulation results verified the feasibility of the two power converter circuit and HESS.

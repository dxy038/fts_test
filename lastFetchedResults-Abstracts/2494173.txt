The objective of this research was to study the effects of drought stress and Fe fertilizer on some physiologic and biochemical characteristics in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). This study was conducted at Campus of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran, during 2011-12. The experiment laid out as split plot based on RCBD with three replications. Conditions without draught stress treatments were regarded as main-plot. The levels Fe fertilizer were as sub-plot contain eight levels (not-application of Fe fertilizer (F1), soil-application of Fe fertilizer (F2),  Fe foliar application at branching (F3), Fe foliar application at flowering (F4), Fe foliar application at podding stage (F5), Fe soil application + Fe foliar application at branching (F6), Fe soil application + Fe foliar application at flowering (F7) and Fe soil application + Fe foliar application at podding stage (F8). Results showed that drought stress treatments had significantly reduced photochemical capacity photosystem II, crop growth rate, chlorophyll content, leaf area index and catalase specific activity. Fe fertilizer treatment had significant effect on chlorophyll content, leaf area index, catalase specific activity and peroxidase specific activity.

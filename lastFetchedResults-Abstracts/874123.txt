We consider a perturbed mathematical programming problem where both the
objective and the constraint functions are analytical in both the underlying decision
variables and in the perturbation variable/parameter that is denoted by  . The
following question arises: what is the description of the solutions of such a perturbed
problem when   → 0? We demonstrate that, under weak conditions, the
solutions of the perturbed problems are obtained as Puiseux series expansions in
 . The results are obtained by application of the Remmert–Stein representation
theorem for complex analytic varieties.

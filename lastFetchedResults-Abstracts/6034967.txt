Systems of multiple sources of energy (SMSEs) are electric systems composed by two or more sources of energy, renewable and not renewable, to generate electrical energy. In this paper, SMSEs are modeled and analyzed as a hybrid system by the use of the formalism differential hybrid Petri nets. In this manner, the objective is to study SMSEs by the use of methods to obtain a more accurate analysis of the system taking into account the interactions among their dynamics, aiding the planners of these systems during the specification phases, development and project. In summary, SMSEs with different operating profiles, depending on system complexity and operation strategy, can be analyzed with regard to their impact on energy storage system performance.

Objective
an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), early coronary revascularization alleviates the synthesis of cardiac collagen and ventricular remodeling. However, the impact of late coronary revascularization on the synthesis of myocardial collagen or on serum collagen biomarkers is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of late coronary revascularization on serum collagen biomarkers after AMI.
s
five patients were divided into early (n = 20) and late (n = 25) coronary revascularization groups. The early coronary revascularization group received either successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy within 6 hours of their myocardial infarction (MI), whereas the late PCI group received PCI between 12 and 14 days after their MI. Serum type I procollagen (PICP) and type III procollagen (PIIINP) were measured by radioimmunoassay.
s
 early coronary revascularization group, the amount of serum PICP on days 60 and 180 was similar to that of week 1 (P &gt; .05). The PICP on days 90 and 180 in the late coronary revascularization group was higher than in the early coronary revascularization group at the same time point (P &lt; .05). No significant difference was evident in mean serum PIIINP between the two groups on day 60 or 180 after the MI (P &lt; .05).
sion
oronary revascularization in patients with acute ST-elevation MI was associated with an elevation in serum PICP. Early coronary revascularization should be performed in patients with ST-elevation, to alleviate myocardial remodeling.

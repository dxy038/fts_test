Theoretical framework of this study shows that there is a structural relationship between the three categories of social capital, social trust and participation. One of the main components of social capital and the major domain of participation is trust in such a way that Putnam regards it as a solution for the problem of collective cooperation. In other words, social capital is realized as a strong bilateral relationship between levels of civic participation and interpersonal trust so that the greater citizen participation in the community, the more they learn to trust one another. When trust between them is more, they are more likely to participate the in their communities. Moreover, people who trust each other tend to have more trust in government agencies. With this theoretical basis, the present study tries to analyze the factors affecting social capital in the central regions of metropolises (Case study: Mashhad central region). Centers that today need to participation to solve problems more than anything else.

Selecting indices for estimating and measuring social capital was performed through three main components: trust (public institution), participation (formal, informal) and awareness (of civil rights).

Therefore, 42 indicators in different dimensions of social capital were selected; which were then reduced to 5 main factors and included 89 percent of the variance.

Decreased left ventricular (LV) longitudinal strain and increased circumferential LV strain have been demonstrated in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and normal LV ejection fraction (LVEF). Biplane myocardial mechanics normalize after aortic valve replacement (AVR). This study objective was to examine LV mechanics before and soon after AVR in patients with AS and LV systolic dysfunction. Paired echocardiographic studies before and soon (7 ± 3 days) after AVR were analyzed in 64 patients with severe AS: 32 with normal LVEF (≥50%), 16 with mild to moderate LV dysfunction (LVEF &lt;36% to 50%), and 16 with severe LV dysfunction (LVEF ≤35%). Longitudinal myocardial function was assessed from 3 apical views (average of 18 segments) and circumferential function was assessed at mid-LV and apical levels (average of 6 segments per view). Strain, strain rate, and mid-LV and apical rotations were measured using 2-dimensional velocity vector imaging. Before AVR (1) longitudinal strain was low in all patients and correlated with LVEF (ρ = 0.74, p &lt;0.001), (2) mid-LV circumferential strain was supranormal in patients with normal LVEF and low in patients with low LVEF (ρ = 0.88, p &lt;0.001), and (3) apical rotation was highest in patients with mild to moderate LV dysfunction. After AVR, LVEF increased in patients with LV dysfunction and myocardial mechanics partly normalized. In conclusion, compensatory mechanisms (high circumferential strain in patients with preserved LVEF and increased apical rotation in patients with mild to moderate LV dysfunction) were observed in patients with severe AS. Compensatory mechanics were lost in patients with severe LV dysfunction. AVR partly reversed these changes in patients with LV dysfunction.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Irregular sexual cycle due of improper hormone secretion is most common cause of infertility. Considering fact that women experience twice the rate of depression as men and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of used treatment methods, therefore this study was conducted to investigate the effect of electric shock on secretion of sex hormones.
METHODS: In this experimental study 60 albino mice (weighting 28±1.5g and 9-12 weeks) with normal sex cycle were divided into 12 groups of 5 mice in each group after determining estrous cycle stages with vaginal smear: four control groups in our estrous cycle stages, four groups receiving one shock in each of four stages and four groups receiving two-shocks (with interval of 4 hours) in each stage of sex cycle. Shock operation was conducted with laboratory shock device and tolerable shock for mice. Blood samples were collected from mice in the same stage of receiving shock to measure sex hormones and assayed by ELISA method and compared.
FINDINGS: Mean serum level of estrogen hormone showed significant difference only in the group receiving two shocks in metestrus stage )3.92±0.074( in comparison to control group of  this stage )4.36±0.118) (p <  0.05). Only in diestrus stage, mean serum level of progesterone of one-shock group )5.264±0.243( and two shock group )5.24±0.029( showed no statistically significant difference in comparison to control group )5.466±0.102).
CONCLUSION: The result of study indicated that electroshock operation had no effect on serum level of both hormones just in diestrus stage of estrous cycle.

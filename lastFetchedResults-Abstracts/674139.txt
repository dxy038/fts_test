Objective
Because of geographical and periodical variation, we prompted to determine 
the demographic features and causative factors for febrile seizure in Rasht.
Materials & Methods 
In this cross-sectional study, all 6–month- to 6-year-old children with the 
diagnosis of febrile seizure admitted to 17 Shahrivar hospital in Rasht, from 
August, 2009 to August, 2010 were studied. Age, sex, family history of 
the disease, seizure types, body temperature upon admission and infectious 
causes of the fever were recorded. All statistical analysis was performed 
with SPSS software, version 16.
Results 
Of the 214 children (mean age, 25.24±15.40 months), 124 were boys and 
109 had a positive family history. Complex seizures were seen in 39 cases. 
In patients with a complex febrile seizure, 59% had the repetitive type, 
20.5% had the focal type and 20.5% had more than 15 minutes duration of 
seizures. Most of the repetitive seizures (78.3%) occurred in patients under 
2 years old; the difference between under and over 2-year-old patients was 
statistically significant. Study results did not show significant differences 
between the two genders for simple or complex seizures. The mean body 
temperature upon admission was 38.2±1.32?C (38.31±0.82 degrees in boys 
and 38.04±1.78 in girls). Upper respiratory infections were seen in most 
patients (74.29%). All cases of lower respiratory infections were boys. 
There was a statistically significant difference between boys and girls in 
causes of fever. 
Conclusion 
Most of the children had a positive family history and the most common causative 
factor was upper respiratory infection.

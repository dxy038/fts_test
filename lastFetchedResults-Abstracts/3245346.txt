Cloud computing is an emerging technology having its foundation on the concept coined by computer pioneer John McCarthy as a time-sharing technology. Cloud computing is a novel technology which looks to offer the small business group to the larger corporations a scalable, cost-effective solution which would serve as a centralized repository solution for highly guarded, sensitive information, services and/or hardware. Although, Cloud computing still remains at its infancy stages, it´s yet to prove how well it can protect its assets against a security breach. This paper will explore the analysis of current security mechanisms utilized with the objective of protecting user´s sensitive data. The following approaches prove to be a significant step in asserting Cloud Computing as a secure services alternative.

Variable speed operation of wind turbines is conducted by torque control below rated wind speed. Variable speed wind turbines could lead to extract maximum power, which is the main objective of torque control, from the potential aerodynamic power of the wind. Torque control methods of wind turbines are classified into two cases; torque mode control and speed mode control. In this paper, simulation results applying two torque control methods in the optimal region are presented for a multi-MW wind turbine and response properties of each method are compared.

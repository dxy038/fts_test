The objective of the work presented in this paper is to design and develop a framework for simulation of requirements engineering processes. The framework is intended to be a support when simulation models are built by guiding the modeler in which components to use in this type of models and to speed up the process of developing simulation models. The framework was developed through an iterative process where it was used to model two processes that previously have been represented in simulation models. The resulting framework consists of three layers; one representing general process modeling concepts, one representing software process concepts, and one representing requirements engineering concepts.

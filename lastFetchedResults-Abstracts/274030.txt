A high authority shape morphing plate is examined. The design incorporates an active Kagome back-plane capable
of changing the shape of a solid face by transmitting loads through a tetrahedral core. This design is known to perform
effectively upon hinging. This article examines limitations on its authority when twisting is required to attain the
desired shapes. The specific objective is to ascertain designs that provide the maximum edge twist subject to specified
passive load. Non-linear effects, such as face wrinkling, have been probed by using a finite element method and the
fidelity of the results assessed through comparison with measurements. The numerical results have been used to validate
a dimensional analysis of trends in the actuation resistance of the structure with geometry, as well as the passive
load capacity. The forces determined by such analysis have been combined with the failure mechanisms for all subsystems
to establish the constraints. The important domains have been visualized using mechanism maps. An optimization
has been used to generate load capacity maps that guide geometric design and provide actuator capacity
requirements.

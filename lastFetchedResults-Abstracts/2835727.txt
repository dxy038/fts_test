The purpose of the study, presented in this paper, has been to apply a multi-objective graph-based method for plan routes of a simulated UAV taking into account scenarios with danger zones or prohibited areas, characteristic of civil airspace, as well as areas with time and speed restrictions and some negotiable &#8220;safe corridors&#8221;. In particular, the method that has been used is New Approach to Multi-Objective A* (NAMOA*), which labelled the paths of the scenariosÂ´ graphs with cost vectors where each component was a different objective to be minimised, such as distance travelled, angle change, time taken, fuel consumption and deviation from the straight path. The results had shown that NAMOA* properly found a set of non-dominated paths equal to an estimated Pareto-optimal front.

This paper presents an optimal design method by means of fuzzy inference. We have already reported the boundary element method with modifying elements, and shown that the objective shape has been obtained with the iterative calculation which utilizes the least square method. However, we have experienced in some cases that the iterative solution does not converge to a certain value. In order to improve the convergency of this method we apply fuzzy inference to the iterative procedure. In this paper, we show that the converged values are obtained even for ill conditioned problems by using the presented method. The advantage of this method is that the iterations can be considerably reduced in comparison with our conventional method

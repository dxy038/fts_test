Introduction & Objective: Hyperinsulinemia is related to obesity, diabetes and hypertension, but its relation to coronary artery disease, as an independent risk factor, is questionable. This study was conducted to compare the insulin level in patients with acute coronary and non coronary diseases. Materials & Methods: This is a cross-sectional study in which two groups of hospitalized patients in emergency department, 32 patients in each group (acute coronary and non coronary disease) were evaluated for fasting insulin level. Diabetes or a family history of it, previous history of coronary artery disease or family history of it, pancreatic origin of abdominal pain, hypertension, overweight or obesity, or using steroids were exclusion criteria for this study. Collected data were analyzed using Mann-Withney test. Results: There was not any statistical difference in age and sex of both groups. No significant difference was noted in insulin level of coronary and non coronary patients in this study. Conclusion: Having these results, we can not include hyperinsulinemia as an independent risk factor for CVD.

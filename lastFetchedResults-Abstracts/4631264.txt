Polarization filtering attracts extensive attention for its special property in solving problems which are unable to deal with in temporal or frequency domain. Conventional polarization filter can suppress interferences by seeking for the orthogonal vector of the interferences while it will inevitably bring in distortion to the target signal in its amplitude and phase; Null phase-shifting polarization filter recovers original objective signal through amplitude and phase compensation, but it shows invalid when interference and target show the same polarized angle; Multi-notch frequency domain polarization filter restrains multi-interference in frequency domain, whereas it may loss effectiveness as several interferences overlapping with target; In this article, A novel polarization filter based on oblique projection theory, is proposed here, which can extract desired target signal through NPVT (non-linear polarization vector translation) augmentation of polarization space, no need any temporal-frequency domain conversion or further process of logic-production.

The objective of this work was to develop a segmentation technique for thickness measurements of the articular cartilage in MR images and to assess the interobserver reproducibility of the method in comparison with manual segmentation. The algorithm is based on a B-spline snakes approach and is able to delineate the cartilage boundaries in real time and with minimal user interaction. The interobserver reproducibility of the method, ranging from 3.3 to 13.6% for various section orientations and joint surfaces, proved to be significantly superior to manual segmentation.

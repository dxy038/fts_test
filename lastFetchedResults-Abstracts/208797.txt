Background: The bark of Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume.) and rhizome of Ginger
(Zingiber officinale Rosc.) have been widely used as spice in Iranian diets.
Objective: The aim of the present study is the evaluation of cytotoxicity of the essential oil and
various extracts of these two plants using Brine shrimp lethality assay (BSL).
Methods: The plants were prepared from a local market and their scientific names were
confirmed with microscopic analysis. The essential oils and various extracts in increasing polarity
order were prepared with hydro distillation and percolation method respectively. The cytotoxicity
of all fractions was evaluated using BSL method in 10, 100 and 1000 μg/ml concentrations. Results
were analyzed using software of probit analysis.
Results: Chloroform, essential oil and ether extracts of cinnamon with LC50 = 9, 10 and 18 μg/ml
respectively ) and essential oil, petroleum ether, methanol and chloroform extracts of Ginger with
LC 50 = 0.03, 4.03, 7.9 and 8.89 μg/ml exhibited the most cytotoxicity in comparing to potassium
dichromate (LC50= 27.75 μg/ml).
Conclusion: All of the fractions from the bark of Cinnamon and rhizome of Ginger exhibited
high cytotoxicity. However it is needed more separation and identification of active components on
the basis of this biological activity. If these results would confirm with the other bioassays, it is
suggested to make safety recommendations for daily consumption of these two plants.

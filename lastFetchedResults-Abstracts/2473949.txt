<p><strong>Objective:</strong> This study was conducted in order to assess the prevalence of different cervicovaginal infections during pregnancy.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> Totally 110 healthy pregnant women with complaints of vaginal symptoms in their third trimester of pregnancy were checked for vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, vaginal trichomoniasis, streptococcus β hemoliticus, gonorrhea, syphilis, and infection by chlamydia trachomatis and HIV.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Among 110 studied women and mostly nullipara, the mean age was 25.2 years. All of them had at least one symptom including discharge, itching or burning of vagina. Among them 39(35.5%) had vaginal and endocervical infection identified by laboratory tests including candidiasis 26.4%, bacterial vaginosis 8% and streptococcus β hemoliticus 5.3 %. Gonorrhea and trichomoniasis were not seen. Three of the patients had positive IgG antibody for chlamydia trachomatis. None of them had serological positive test for syphilis and HIV.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Symptomatic pregnant women need to be actively searched for infections. Besides speculum examination as an easy to carry out clinical test and if needed laboratory exams must be used to choose the best treatment.  </p>

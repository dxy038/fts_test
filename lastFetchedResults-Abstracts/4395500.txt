A typical low power IPT system employs an H-Bridge converter with a simple control strategy to generate a high frequency current from DC power supply. This paper proposes a cascaded multilevel converter for bidirectional IPT (BIPT) systems, which is suitable for low to medium power applications as well as for situations such as PV cells where several individual DC sources are to be utilized. A novel modulation strategy is proposed for the multilevel converter with the aim of minimizing switching losses. Series - Series (SS) compensation circuit is adopted for the IPT system and a mathematical model is presented to minimize the coil losses of the system under varying output power. Theoretical results presented in comparison to the simulations to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed concept and the validity of the developed model. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed phase shift modulation.

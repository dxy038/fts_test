For the purpose of solving the multi-objective reentry trajectory optimization problem with multiple path and terminal constraints for a hypersonic reentry-gliding vehicle, the energy-like dynamic equations are introduced by original time-varying equations so that the problem can be finally transformed to a non-linear program NLP problem with fixed terminal values. After that, a numerical optimization method based on PSO algorithm is considered, where the adaptive penalty technique and Normalized Non-dominated Sorting technique are used to handling the multi-constraints and multi-objectives, respectively. The simulation shows that the complete longitudinal multi-objective trajectories can be generated by the proposed algorithm and the optimized angles of attack can provide multiple references for practical engineering.

We propose and experimentally demonstrate a new of bidirectional wavelength add-drop multiplexer using multiport optical circulators and fiber Bragg gratings. It has the efficient suppression of the unwanted light caused by Rayleigh backscattering and optical reflection and is economical for the effective use of multiport optical circulators.

Objective: To observe the influence of the different plant oils for antioxidation of the mice. Methods: The activities of GSH-Px, SOD and the content of MDA in liver of mice were detected after six-weeks by intragastric supplementation of walnut oil, perilla oil, pine oil of different doses. Results: In contrast to normal control group, there were significant differences in the activities of GSH-Px, SOD and the content of MDA in liver of mice with the different dose of walnut, perilla oil, pine oil. Conclusion: In the ranges of the dosage in this experiment, walnut oil, perilla oil, pine oil could improve the activities of GSH-Px, SOD and decrease the content of MDA in liver of mice and may be used as an antioxidant.

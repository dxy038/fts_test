In this paper, optimal power flow (OPF) model has been developed and analyzed with thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) for practical power networks using NewtonÂ´s optimization technique. The minimization of total system real power losses is an objective with controlling the power flow of specified transmission lines. This model has considered the optimal settings generators, transformers and TCSC devices. The optimal transmission losses and corresponding generation schedules with optimal TCSC setting parameters for different case studies have also been reported. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been tested for IEEE-30 bus systems with single and multiple TCSC devices. The proposed model converges very fast and independent of initial conditions. It has also been observed that the proposed algorithm can be applied to larger systems and do not suffer with computational difficulties.

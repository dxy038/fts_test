The Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) is a simple and efficient routing protocol designedspecifically for use in multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks of mobile nodes. Preemptive DSR(PDSR) is themodified version of DSR. The main objective of this paper is to analyze and compare the performance ofPreemptive DSR and Temporarily Ordered Routing Algorithm(TORA).It discusses the effect of variation innumber of nodes and average speed on protocol performance. Simulation results (provided by theinstructor) are analyzed to get an insight into the operation of TORA and PDSR in small/large sizednetworks with slow/fast moving nodes. Results show that PDSR outperforms TORA in terms of the numberof MANET control packets used to maintain/erase routes. Also, it is concluded that TORA is a better choice than PDSR for fast moving highly connected set of nodes. It is also observed that DSR provides better data throughput than TORA and that routes can be created faster in PDSR than in TORA. This paper tries to explain the reasons behind the nature of the resu

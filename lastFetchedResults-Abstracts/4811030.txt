This paper proposes an approach to analyze the performance of the distribution system by integrating wind distributed generation (DG) system. With the increased penetration level of DG, the operation and control becomes a difficult task. However with the accurate modeling of wind generators, the parameters of the system can be controlled effectively. In this work, two types of wind generators are accurately modeled and integrated at the most sensitive bus in the distribution system with an objective of controlling the voltage and reducing active and reactive power losses. The performance of self-excited and doubly-fed wind generators at different speeds are simulated using MATLAB programming and analyzed. The impact of these generators when integrated in 33-bus distribution system is analyzed and results are compared. From results it is found that doubly-fed wind generator gave satisfactory performance compare to self-excited wind generator.

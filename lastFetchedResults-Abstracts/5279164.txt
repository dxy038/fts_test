A novel architecture of the robotÂ´s trajectory planner is proposed. It uses both a conventional trajectory generation algorithm based on underdetermined splines optimized with respect to some quadratic criteria together with a neural network module capable of coping with a nonlinear multi-objective design problem. The backpropagation network structure is chosen. The network has learned the positions of trajectory via-points that fit the requirements concerning both the joint driving torques and deviation from nominal trajectory. The simulation study shows the feasibility of the proposed solution in the cases of one and two via-points

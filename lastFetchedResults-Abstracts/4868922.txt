This paper research the surface ship air defense combat process optimization problem. So as to shorten the synergy of the surface ship area air defense missile time, increase the efficiency of the surface ship area air defense combat, it take the process optimization area air defense as the goal, introducing Petri net technology to the surface ship to air defense combat time performance analysis model of the process. This model combine fuzzy mathematics with the dynamic programming optimization technology, find out the critical path of the process for air defense combat, aiming at three typical area air defense, and consider the incoming target time urgency, to give priority to fire fighting and our minimum resources as objective function, the three types of combat efficiency of air defense mode comparative simulation. The simulation results show that the use of process optimization based on Petri net process technology can effectively simplify the area air defense, improve the efficiency of command.

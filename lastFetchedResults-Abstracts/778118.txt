It is widely accepted that, series compensation
of transmission lines results in increscent of power
transfer capability. This kind of compensation may be led
to adverse oscillations. The main objective of this work is
to design a supplementary Sub-Synchronous Resonance
(SSR) damping controller for STACOM using the
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. For this
purpose, the STATCOM is utilized and a supplementary
controller is granted to its conventional controller.
Furthermore, a performance index which is defined based
on the system dynamics is implemented as an objective
function to examine the potential of STATCOM in
mitigating the oscillations. The effectiveness of the
proposed controller is demonstrated through Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) analysis and time domain simulations
conducted on IEEE Second Benchmark Model (SBM)
combined with STATCOM.

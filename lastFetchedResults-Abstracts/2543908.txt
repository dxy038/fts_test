Abstract

Objective

The basal ganglia are a group of structures that act as a cohesive functional unit. They are situated at the base of the forebrain and are strongly connected with the cerebral cortex and thalamus. Some speech disorders such as stuttering can resulted from disturbances in the circuits between the basal ganglia and the language motor area of the cerebral cortex. Stuttering consists of blocks, repetitive, prolongation or cessation of speech. We present a 7.5 -year-old male child with bilateral basal ganglia lesion in globus pallidus with unclear reason.

The most obvious speech disorders in patient was stuttering, but also problems in swallowing, monotone voice, vocal tremor, hypersensitivity of gag reflex and laryngeal dystonia were seen. He has failed to respond to drug treatment, so he went on rehabilitation therapy when his problem progressed.

In this survey, we investigate the possible causes of this type of childhood neurogenic stuttering.

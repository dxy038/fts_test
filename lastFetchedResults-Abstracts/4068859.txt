This paper presents the analysis and novel controller design for a hybrid switched-capacitor bidirectional dc/dc converter. Features of voltage step-down, step-up, and bidirectional power flow are integrated into a single circuit. The novel control strategy enables simpler dynamics compared to a standard buck converter with an input filter, good regulation capability, low electromagnetic interference, lower source current ripple, ease of control, and continuous input current waveform in both modes of operation (buck and boost modes).

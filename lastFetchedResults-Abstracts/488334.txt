Background and Objectives: Shallots are an important part of the diet of many populations and show some different pharmacological effects in different medical aspects. Some studies have been performed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of shallots. The objective of this survey was to evaluate its antifungal activities in several fungal species.
Methods: In this experimental study, after extracting shallot by soxhlet's procedure, antifungal effects of alcoholic and aqueous extracts of shallot (Allium hirtifolium) against 5 saprophyte species (Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium gryseogenum and Alternaria) and 2 dermatophyte species (Microsporum canis and Trichophyton mentagrophytes) were evaluated in vitro. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICS) were determined by broth macrodilution method and finally were compared with miconazole.
Results: Allium hirtifolium showed antifungal effects against all the tested fungi with MIC ranged between 0.058 to 0.8 mg/ml for alcoholic extract and 0.26 to 3.84 mg/ml for aqueous extract, respectively. Minimum Fungicidal Concentrations (MFCS) of alcoholic and aqueous extracts ranged between 0.1 to 12.8 mg/ml and 0.6 to 68.26 mg/ml, respectively.
Conclusion: This study indicated that shallot crude juice has antifungal activity and looks promising to be an alternatative for chemical antifungal agents that have sometimes serious side effects.

Mobile Internet and mobile services that make use of mobile data are increasingly popular. However, the cost of content delivery, in particular, multimedia type content over cellular networks is still high and poses a challenge for some users who are not necessarily willing or cannot afford to pay too much for it. The problem is further exacerbated when video content is used, as this type of content is heavier and can lead to higher bills. In this context, this paper presents a novel cost-oriented adaptive multimedia delivery (COMEDY) mechanism that considers the user´s willingness to pay for a certain video quality and user´s mobile device characteristics to deliver adaptive multimedia content over wireless connection. The goal of the mechanism is to reduce the cost of multimedia delivery for users that are not willing to pay that much. The mechanism is evaluated both through objective and subjective studies. The evaluation shows that the proposed mechanism provides a reduction in the price paid for accessing multimedia content, and the user´s perceived quality is not negatively affected.

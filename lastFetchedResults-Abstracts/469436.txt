Objective
We evaluated the tolerability of emergency contraception in adolescents.
Study design
In this descriptive study, 1 0.75 mg levonorgestrel tablet was administered to 52 females aged 13-16 with instructions to take the second tablet 12 hours later (unprotected intercourse was not an entry requirement). Participants kept diaries of side effects and menstrual patterns. We assessed correct use, side effects caused by treatment, and impact on menstrual cycle.
Results
Virtually all participants used the drug correctly, with no serious adverse events. Minor expected side effects occurred, including nausea, fatigue, and vomiting. There was no difference in reporting of side effects by age. Adolescents' mean duration of menses was comparable pre- and post-treatment (5.3 vs 5.0 days; P = .146), and onset of menses was within the expected range. Ninety percent of participants reported they would recommend emergency contraception to a friend or relative if needed.
Conclusion
Adolescents tolerated the medication well, experiencing transient side effects.

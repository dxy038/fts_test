A historical project is used as a reference model for the verification planning process. The planning equations and an example are presented. The example objective set is to increase the level of defect removal from the final software from the historical level of 35% to about 88% of the defects introduced into the code and to reduce the overall number of delivered defects/KLOC by 85%. The example illustrates the methods used to estimate the phase-by-phase effort required to achieve the specified goal. The use of the planning model and the resulting data in day-to-day activities is also discussed

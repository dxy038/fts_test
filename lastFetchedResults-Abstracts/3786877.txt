Non-real-time packets in the interactive multimedia satellite network suffer inherent delay in cases of traffic congestion. Moreover, these packets may be discarded from the queue if they are not sent within a certain time. The objective of this study is to develop a real-time method in order to minimize the packet discard rate. Extensive evaluation results show that the proposed method performs very well.

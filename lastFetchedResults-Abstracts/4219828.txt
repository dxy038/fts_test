Biogas refers to a gas made from anaerobic digestion of kitchen waste. Methane is a clean energy one of the constituent of biogas which has a great potential to be an alternative fuel. Abundant biomass from various institutions could be a source for Methane production where combination of waste treatment and energy production would be an advantage. In state of Tamil Nadu around of 2944 educational institutions are there, from those institutions a large amount of waste is produced but those waste are not utilized. Objective of this study is to utilize the kitchen waste in an bio digester to produce biogas which will be the alternative fuel for their kitchen energy need. This work was carried out to produce biogas in a Compact Water Plastic Tank with a fixed type, using different kitchen waste from the kitchen, hostel, and canteen in Adithya Institute of Technology. It was realized through the Observation and Experimental Test using 5 liter bottles, the gas produced within 21 days. In the experimental pilot and scale up tank, the formula was fermented and the 5 different types of digesters were tested. If this system is implemented in all institutions of state of Tamil Nadu the energy that can be recovered is discussed.

Background Nonrandomized studies suggest that atrial fibrillation is independently associated with increased mortality in patients with heart failure. Whether restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm will have a beneficial impact on cardiovascular mortality in patients with heart failure has never been tested in an adequately powered randomized trial. Objective  The primary objective of the Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure (AF-CHF) trial is to determine whether restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm significantly reduces cardiovascular mortality compared with a rate-control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation and CHF. Methods AF-CHF is a prospective multicenter trial (109 centers in Canada, United States, South America, Europe, and Israel), that will randomize 1450 patients with CHF with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% and atrial fibrillation to 1 of 2 treatment strategies: (1) rhythm control with the use of electrical cardioversion combined with antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone or other class III agents), (2) rate control with the use of β-blockers, digoxin, or pacemaker and AV nodal ablation. Cardiovascular mortality is the primary end point and the intention-to-treat approach the primary method of analysis. We anticipate an 18.75% 2-year cardiovascular mortality in the rate control arm with a 25% mortality reduction in the rhythm control group. Results  As of August 13, 2002, 334 patients have been enrolled from 68 participating centers. Enrollment is expected to be concluded in May 2003 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Conclusion  The results of this trial should provide definitive information concerning 2 widely applicable treatment strategies of atrial fibrillation in a large cohort of patients with CHF.

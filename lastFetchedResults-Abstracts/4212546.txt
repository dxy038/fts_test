The LUPO projectÂ´s objective is the rapid evaluation of autonomous technologies in production, assembling and logistics in order to make a solid statement about the best mix of centralized and decentralized control in enterprises. For this purpose a hybrid simulator is developed. The hybrid simulator consists of physical work-piece demonstrators and machine-center demonstrators which are equipped with various autonomous communication techniques. Processes can be quickly built, varied, simulated and analyzed by using a modern production management system. At the end of the project it should be possible to receive reliable results on the benefits of autonomous production objects within a week.

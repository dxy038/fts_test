Load shedding is an efficient solution to improve power system reliability when a contingency occurs. Considering loads difference has great significance in the process of load shedding. This paper proposes a new minimum load shedding calculation approach based on multi objective optimization theory. The load shedding model proposed in this paper considers the loads difference and introduces the importance factor to describe the difference. This approach will first cut those less important loads and try to get the minimum total load shedding amount in the process of load shedding. The case results shows the rightness and validity of the approach proposed in this paper.

 Background Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has
                            been safely used in selected patient populations. The purpose of this
                            study was to determine the safety and efficacy of NIPPV outside the
                            intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary hospital. This descriptive,
                            cross sectional study was performed at Masih Daneshvari Hospital,
                            Tehran, Iran during 2011 - 2015. Methods Between March 2011 and June
                            2015, patients requiring NIPPV were enrolled in the study. The study
                            population included all eligible patients. Census sampling was applied
                            in this study. The patients’ medical history (including comorbidities),
                            age, sex, and hospital ward in which NIPPV was delivered were assessed
                            retrospectively. Moreover, venous pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide
                            (PCO<sub>2</sub>), and bicarbonate
                            (HCO<sub>3-</sub>) were analyzed before and after the
                            intervention (NIPPV application). Results A total of 946 patients,
                            including 598 (63.2%) men and 348 (36.8%) women, received NIPPV for
                            inpatient hospital care. The mean age of the patients was 61.92 ± 15.5
                            years (range, 3 - 102 years). Indications for NIPPV included
                            exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 55.4%),
                            obstructive sleep apnea (OSA; 6%), bronchiectasis (7.8%), concurrence of
                            COPD and OSA (4.8%), neuromuscular disorders (1.7%), congestive heart
                            failure (4%), postthoracotomy pain (0.6%), thoracic malignancy (2.1%),
                            pulmonary thromboembolism (1.1%), pneumonia (7.3%), asthma (1.5%),
                            interstitial lung disease (2.5%), tuberculosis (4%), and cystic fibrosis
                            (1.3%). We found significant improvements in venous pH and PCO2 with no
                            significant changes in HCO<sub>3</sub>- (P &gt; 0.05).
                            Conclusions NIPPV could be safely used under the supervision of trained
                            pulmonologists in non-ICU settings. This method was effective in
                            treating acute abnormalities in venous blood gas, including pH and
                            PCO<sub>2</sub>.

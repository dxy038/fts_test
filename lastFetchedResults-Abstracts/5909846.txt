A new scheme for detecting single and multibit (unidirectional and bidirectional) errors using residue codes has been proposed. This procedure has been applied to circuits with outputs up to 8 bits. It has been shown that about 99% of all multibit errors can be detected using this scheme.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

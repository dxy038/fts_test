The levels of quality, maintainability, testability, and stability of software can be improved and measured through the use of automated testing tools throughout the software development process. Automated testing tools assist software engineers to gauge the quality of software by automating the mechanical aspects of the software-testing task Automated testing tools vary in their underlying approach, quality, and ease-of-use, among other characteristics. In this paper we propose a suite of objective metrics for measuring tool characteristics, as an aid in systematically evaluating and selecting automated testing tools.

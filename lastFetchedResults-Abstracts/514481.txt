Background: The family Rosaceae, include some large genus, eg; the genus Rose includes 200 species and 18000 cultivars. Objective: Aim of this study is to determine the chemical composition of the hydrodistilled oil of the leaves of Sanguisorba minor scop, of Iranian origin for the first time. Methods: The essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation of Sanguisorba minor was analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Results: The major constituents appeared to be (E, E) farnesyl acetate (13.4%), nonadecane (11.2%) and docosane (11.0%). Conclusion: In Sanguisorba minor we identified 17 components representing 93.2%. It's rich in regard to aliphatic hydrocarbons (40.6%), five sesquiterpenes (36.8%), one oxygenated monoterpene (7.3%) and one aliphatic aldehyde (8.3%).

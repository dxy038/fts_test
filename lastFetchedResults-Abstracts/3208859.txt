In this paper we analyze the results of the implementation of new technologies in the framework of education related to the visualization of architectural projects. On the basis of the evaluation of the technological profile of students, we propose the use of various augmented reality systems for viewing different projects in the degree of Architecture with mobile devices. The main objective is to assess whether the proposed methodology improves the student learning process and thus generates a satisfactory response.

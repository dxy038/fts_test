Objective: Cosmetic surgery has become increasingly popular in the past decades. The purpose of this
study was to design a questionnaire for screening ‘negative body image’ in special needs populations
referring to cosmetic clinics.
Method: One hundred and fifty special needs individuals in cosmetic clinics were randomly selected and
assigned to fill questionnaires to assess their body part concerns.
Results: Results of reliability analysis and validity have shown the effectiveness of this questionnaire for
recognizing individuals with negative body image. These preliminary results suggest that body
dysmorphic disorder may be relatively common among patients seeking cosmetic surgery.
Conclusions: A high proportion of patients in cosmetic clinics have demonstrated significant body image
concerns. These relatively common body image concerns deserve more study in adolescents and people
with special needs.

This paper shows the design of a fuzzy controller to maintain stoichiometric air-fuel mixture in an internal combustion engine. This objective is very important for the performance in a vehicle, to achieve a stoichiometric ratio for reducing emissions, improving energetic efficiency and power generation, with a reduction in the operating temperatures of an engine. The mixture control is accomplished with precision devices led by the electronic control unit (ECU), which is essentially a logical device that is responsible for maintaining a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. We will discuss the mathematical modeling of an internal combustion engine, showing a fuzzy control scheme, which consists in a predictive (forward control) and other corrective (Feedback control) action. In this first phase of the project we present the simulation results using the Simulink of Matlab<sup>&#174;</sup>.

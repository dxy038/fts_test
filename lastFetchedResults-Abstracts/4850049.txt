Objective: To explore the influence of industrial noise to workers&#194;&#191; tympanic membrane. Methods: The collected data are divided into different groups in accordance with the purpose of the analysis, and then find out the difference by contrast with different groups. Results: The incident rate of hearing loss is 10.91% and the incident rate of tympanic membrane is 0.53%, and the incident rate of male and female tympanic membrane perforation is 0.32% and 0.21% respectively. Conclusion: High-intensity industrial noise can chronically perforate workers&#194;&#191; tympanic membrane.

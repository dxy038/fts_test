This letter presents an adaptive denoising method based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). By incorporating a global subspace analysis into the scheme of local basis selection, the problems of previous adaptive methods are effectively tackled. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves outstanding preservation of image details, and at high noise levels it provides improvements in both objective and subjective quality of the denoised image when compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

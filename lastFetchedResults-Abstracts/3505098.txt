Network topological optimization with a reliability constraint is considered. The objective is to find the topological layout of links, at a minimal cost, under the constraint that the network reliability is not less than a given level of system reliability. A decomposition method, based on branch and bound, is used for solving the problem. In order to speed up the procedure, an upper bound on system reliability, in terms of node degrees, is applied. A numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of the method

in arid and semi arid areas, where available water for agricultural sector is limited. the main objective of this sector is to drive more yields and benefits from lower amount of irrigation water. in order to study the responses of potato cultivars to limited water supply, an experiment was carried out with three potato cultivars (Agria, Morene, Cozima), and three levels of irrigation (400, 600 and 800mm per hector and season). in year 2000. Factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design with three replications was used to study growth indices of different levels of irrigation, based on GDD, and relationships of yield, yield components and other characters were determined. Analysis of variance showed that different levels of irrigation influenced all cultivar characters differently except the number of shoots and tuber per plant. Except for the percentage of tubers with a diameter of smaller than 4cm. there was a negative effect of water shortages, at 400 mm level, on plant dry matter, dry matter of tuber, tuber number per plant, plant height, root dry matter. harvest index, tuber yield. the yield of tubers with a diameter of more than 7 cm and ware tuber yield. However, the results obtained from 8OOmm and 600mm irrigation levels were similar. Although there was no significant difference for total tuber yield between 600 and 800mm irrigation levels, the ware tuber yield at 600mm irrigation level was significantly greater than those of other two levels. Considering all these aspects, the 600mm irrigation level as recommended for all of the varieties under study.

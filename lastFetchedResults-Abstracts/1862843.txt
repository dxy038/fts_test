We present here the results of our inter-disciplinary examination of the mummified heart of Blessed Anne-Madeleine Remuzat (1696–1730). This organ has been examined in the context of a canonization process. This analysis is related to important aspects of the early history of anatomy in Europe, that of “Holy autopsies”, and to the relationship between anatomical investigations, Catholic theology, and religious/medical customs.

ing to anatomical, genetic, toxicological, and palynological analyses, it has been shown that this organ has not been naturally (“miraculously”) conserved but embalmed using myrtle, honey, and lime. Moreover, a right ventricle dilatation has been diagnosed, that may represent a post-tuberculosis condition and may have played a role in the cause of death of this religious figure.

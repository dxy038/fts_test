Through the paper our goal is to locate any given polar co-ordinate by controlling the driving unit in a very cost effective way using inverse kinematics. Mechanical and Electrical parts are assembled thereby. The main objective of this project is to perform point to point movements like dispensing, loading, pick and place, assembling and palletizing, precise welding and cutting an object perfectly through robot arm. The arm is compliant in the X-Y direction but rigid in the ´Z´ direction. Nylon fiber is used as arm and ULN2003 is used to control stepper motor. Linear voltage regulator IC 7805 has been used to convert a dc voltage of (18-20V) into 5V. A centre tapped step down transformer has been used to convert the supply voltage into 18V. Gearing is used to improve precision performance of stepper motor. The whole project is controlled by computer via parallel port.

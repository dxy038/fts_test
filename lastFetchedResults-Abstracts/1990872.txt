Objective (s): Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a leading cause of cervical cancer and sexually transmitted infections are common health problems among young females. This study aimed to assess knowledge, attitude and acceptance of the HPV vaccine in female students of a medical university.
Methods: The present cross sectional study was conducted on 202 female students. Data were collected using a questionnaire containing items on demographic, items related to knowledge, attitudes, and acceptance of the HPV vaccine.
Results: The findings showed that the majority of students (66.8%) had poor knowledge and in 5% of cases the level of knowledge level was found to be good. About 25 percent of students had a positive attitude and 2.5 percent had negative attitudes toward the HPV vaccine. Over 70% of students reported if vaccine were available, they are willing to receive it. The regression model showed that age was related to the level of knowledge (B =0.36, p  < 0.0001). Knowledge of nursing and midwifery students was higher than others (p  <  0.0001). Married students were more aware than singles (p=0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that there was no significant relationship between the level of knowledge of cervical cancer and attitudes towards cervical cancer vaccine. Logistic regression model, had showed a significant relationship between knowledge of cervical cancer and acceptance of the HPV vaccine (OR= 1.8, and p  < 0.01). Attitudes toward vaccines (OR =1.6, P  < 0.000), and marital status (OR =5.1, P =0.02) were predictors of vaccine acceptance.
Conclusion: Due to lack of programs related to prevention of human papilloma virus and vaccination in the country, implementing community awareness and prevention programs seem essential.

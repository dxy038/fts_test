The objective of this study was to optimize the protocols for bovine oocytes activation through comparing the effectiveness of different treatments on the activation and subsequent development of oocytes and examining the effects of two combined activation treatments on the blastocyst apoptosis and ploidy. Cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs) were recovered from abattoir-derived ovaries and matured in vitro. After maturation, cumulus-free oocytes were activated according to the experiment designs. Activated oocytes were cultured in vitro in modified synthetic oviductal fluid (mSOF) medium and assessed for pronuclear formation (15–16 h), cleavage (46–48 h) and development to the blastocyst stage. In Experiment 1, the matured oocytes were treated with single activation agents, including ionomycin (5 μM for 5 min), ethanol (7% for 7 min), calcium ionophore A23187 (5 μM for 5 min) or strontium (10 mM for 5 h). The pronuclear formation and cleavage rate were higher significantly in ionomycin (39.0 and 30.7%) and ethanol (41.5 and 28.1%) treatment alone compared to other treatments (9.7–25.2 and 11.3–23.7%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). Very low blastocyst rates (3.9–5.3%) resulted which were not significantly different among treatments (P &gt; 0.05). For the combined activation treatment (Experiment 2), the same concentrations of ionomycin and ethanol as in Experiment 1 were used in combination with either 6-dimethylaminopurine (6-DMAP, 2.0 mM for 3 h) or cycloheximide (CHX) + cytochalasin B (CB, 10 μg/ml for 3 h). The pronuclear formation, cleavage rate, blastocyst rate and cell number of blastocyst were higher significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in ionomycin + 6-DMAP treatment (67.1, 69.2, 28.0 and 91.3%, respectively) and ethanol + CHX + CB treatment (68.9, 70.2, 25.5 and 89.3%, respectively) compared to other treatments (11.7–58.1, 10.2–47.1, 1.5–24.2 and 34.2–62.7%, respectively). In Experiment 3, the parthenogenetic blastocysts produced by activation with ionomycin + 6-DAMP and ethanol + CHX + CB and in vitro fertilized blastocysts (control group) were examined for apoptosis using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The ethanol + CHX + CB treatment (7.0%) showed significantly lower blastocyst apoptosis index compared to ionomycin + 6-DAMP treatment (9.1%, P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the chromosomal composition in the parthenotes embryos differed (P &lt; 0.05) among treatments. The percentage of haploid parthenotes was higher in ionomycin + 6-DMAP treatment than ethanol + CHX + CB treatment. These results suggested that ethanol + CHX + CB treatment was more favorable protocol for parthenogenesis of bovine oocytes.

Introduction: Migraine is a common disease which frequently begins in adolescence. According to previous studies, migraine prevalence in adolescence ranges from 6% to 12%.
Objective: This descriptive -- analytic study was carried out to determine the prevalence of migraine in highschool students of Rasht in the spring of 2002.
Materials and Methods: To carry out the study, a sample of 1965 high- school students within age group of 14-18y/old was selected and the UCSD migraine questionnaire was used as the instrument of the study. The questionnairres were distributed among the samples and the answers to them were analyzed according to the objectives of the study.
Results: Overall prevalence rate for migraine was 8.85% (95% CI, 6.7tol0.1). The prevalence of migraine with Aura was 1.88% (95% CI, 1.3to 2.5) and that of migraine without Aura was 6.97%(95% CI 5.8 to 8.1). The prevalence of migraine without Aura was 3.7 times more than that of migraine with Aura (P<0.001). Among migranous students, the female to male ratio was 1.9:1(P<0.001).
Conclusion: We found that migraine is relatively common in highschool students and some measures to identify migrainous students and to treat them properly should be undertaken.

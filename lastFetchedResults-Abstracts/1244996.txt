This paper deals with the problem of dielectric liquids purification. The separation process of mechanical impurities from dielectric liquids in an electric field is analyzed and an experimentally validated mathematical model is proposed for the electroseparation process. The main objective is to find a relationship to describe the kinetics of particles electroseparation, solving the problem of establishing a relationship of dependency between initial concentration and final concentration with time, and determining the electroseparation time depending on particles and liquid dielectric properties.

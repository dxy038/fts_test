In this paper, multiple approaches for solving Volt/VAR Control (VVC) optimization problem are compared. Two different VVC schemes are evaluated in detail for managing Distribution control assets such as Load Tap Changers, capacitor banks and voltage regulators on day ahead basis to achieve multiple objective functions by minimizing switching operations of the assets. The first approach is an integrated optimization based on a dynamic programming algorithm converging to a global optimal solution with the drawback of time of convergence. The second approach is a coordinated optimization algorithm that is computationally efficient at the expense of optimality (an approximate solution to the minimum cost of the objective function). The algorithms are applied on a real world distribution network. Robust Matlab/OpenDSS simulation platform is used to compare the effectiveness of the algorithms.

The objective of the present work was to study the influence of two different osmotic agents (sucrose and corn syrup) on the osmotic dehydration of papaya slices (Carica papaya L.). The study was carried out using two factorial experimental designs, with three independent variables whose levels varied from 44% to 56% w/w for concentration, from 34 to 46 Â°C for temperature and from 120 to 210 min for immersion time. The responses of the experimental designs were the weight reduction (WR), water loss (WL), solids gain (SG) and water activity (aw). The results showed that, considering the same osmotic pressure for both osmotic agents, the values obtained for WR, WL and SG for dehydration in sucrose solutions were higher than those obtained in corn syrup solutions, due to their high viscosity and polysaccharide content. The opposite behavior was observed for aw. The models obtained for the response variables followed a linear behavior except for SG.

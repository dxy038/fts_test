The objective of the present work is to explore how the concept of gain/loss modulation can be used for switching and routing applications in the case of longitudinal type PT symmetry structures where the complex index profile is build along the direction of light propagation. In the spirit of our previous work we demonstrate that operation compatible with practical applications can be achieved with an imperfect PT-symmetry design, where only the gain is variable while the losses are set fix.

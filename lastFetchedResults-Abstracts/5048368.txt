The objective of this paper is to use a simple bang-bang control law to regulate the position of a lightly damped system. This work is motivated by previous work on bang-bang control for systems with two integrators. The advantage of the proposed bang-bang controller for lightly damped systems is its simplicity and its robustness. The control signal is piecewise constant with an initial step change that causes the system output to reach the desired value at the first peak of its response. A subsequent step change forces the system to remain at the desired value and prevents further oscillations. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the theoretical results.

Wireless networks have been rapidly developing in recent years. The main objective of this paper is to propose a video transcoding scheme to provide the scalable video data over wireless transmission applications. Moreover video transcoding methods are required for high speed. So we used the pixel-domain close-loop video transcoding construction with reusing decoding information to output H.264 SVC bitstream. Finally, experimental results demonstrated the proposed scheme can reduce the computation of the transcoding process and maintain the output video quality. Our transcoder represents a practical solution which enables rich media communication in heterogeneous mobile environments.

Background: Active immunization with gonadotropin releasing hormone conjugate (GnRH-BSA) manipulates the fertility axis and thus alters the reproductive cyclicity, serum estradiol and progesterone levels. While the application of Kamdhenu ark increases the efficacy of GnRH-BSA.
Objective: This experimental investigation is aimed to evaluate the modulatory effects on estrous cycle, serum estradiol and progesterone levels in female mice after Kamdhenu ark and GnRH-BSA immunization.
Materials and Methods: Sixty sexually mature female mice were divided into three groups of twenty each. Group I served as control, while group II was immunized with GnRH-BSA conjugate (50?g/animal) for 120 days. However, group III was supplemented with Kamdhenu ark (100 ppm) orally along with GnRH-BSA conjugate immunizations and their vaginal estrous cyclicity, serum estradiol and progesterone levels were estimated after 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of intervals.
Results: GnRH-BSA immunized females showed regular estrous cycle initially but after 13th day animals started showing irregular and prolonged estrous cycle with a complete diestrus stage after 65th day onwards. In connection to this, GnRH-BSA + Kamdhenu ark supplemented animals also showed regular cyclicity initially but later they showed more interrupted cycle with complete diestrus stage after 55th day. Besides this, the serum estradiol and progesterone levels lowered significantly in all the experimental groups as compared to control animals. The more severe decrease in hormonal levels was noticed in later part of the experiment especially in the group supplemented with Kamdhenu ark along with GnRH-BSA immunizations.
Conclusion: All these observations suggest that the GnRH-BSA conjugate has a deleterious effect on the reproductive hormones and estrous cycle of female mice; and Kamdhenu ark acts as a bioenhancer in immunization efficacy to modulate these effects.

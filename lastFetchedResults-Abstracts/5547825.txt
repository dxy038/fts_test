Summary form only given. Compression of diode laser pulses and broad spectral tuning of the compressed pulses is of current interest due to the expected increase in second-harmonic efficiency that could be realized due to the decreased pulse durations and narrow spectral bandwidths. With this objective in mind, we used commercial InGaAs-GaAs single-mode ridge waveguide lasers, which had an active stripe width of 3 /spl mu/m, a cavity length of 750 /spl mu/m, and an emission wavelength of 980 nm. The typical gain-switched pulse duration was 35 ps at a user-defined pulse repetition frequency, in the range 1.80-2.70 GHz and average powers up to 100 mW.

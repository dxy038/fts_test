The synchronization of neuron networks using the contraction theory is reported in this contribution. The contraction theory provides a simple method to determine convergence of trajectories of the systems in the network instead of the Master Stability Function and the calculation of Lyapunov exponents. The objective is to determine the contraction region where once the trajectories reach such region they will converge each other and remain in such a contraction region. Such a condition lies mainly on the system parameters, network topology and coupling strength.

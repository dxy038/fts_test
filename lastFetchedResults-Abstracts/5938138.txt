In recent years, IP telephone use has spread rapidly, thanks to the development of VoIP (voice over IP) technology. However, an unavoidable problem of the IP telephone is deterioration of speech due to packet loss, which often occurs on the wireless network. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel lost speech reconstruction method using speech recognition and synthesis. This proposed method uses linguistic information and can deal with the lack of syllable units, which conventional methods are unable to handle. We conducted subjective and objective evaluation experiments. These results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method. Although there is a processing delay in the proposed method, we believe that this method opens up new applications for speech recognition and speech synthesis technology.

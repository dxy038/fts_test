The objective of this research was to study the effect of different environmental factors on performance of solar photovoltaic panel. The photovoltaic solar power represents one of the most promising energy in the world. It is also the cleanest form of energy. But the implementation of a PV system has shown that their reliability and efficiency depend upon many factors. The output of solar PV system is mainly affected by different environmental factors like dust, color, irradiance, shading, etc. Because in all the cases, the output power and efficiency are more rather than affected condition. Here the number of experiment has been conducted to verify the change in i-v and p-v characteristics of the system. The experimental data were used to calculate the efficiency and power output of the system. The result shows that the output power and efficiency are affected by environmental factors.

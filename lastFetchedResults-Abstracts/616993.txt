The objective of this study was to manufacture particleboard made from UF with low formaldehyde (E1) for use in indoor environments. The influence of UF in particles on the formaldehyde emission and its mechanical properties were investigated. The experimental results showed that the formaldehyde emission released decreased linearly with consumption UF-low formaldehyde- particle. Formaldehyde emission was below 0.3 mg/L when the weight percentage of UF particles was up to 60%. The formaldehyde emission from urea-formaldehyde resin-impregnated paper overlaid particleboard was 17% lower than UF ordinary (E2) for particleboard. The reason is that the bending strength, internal bonding strength decreased with increasing low-formaldehyde UF. However, the percentage thickness swelling of the particleboard decreased with increasing UF-low formaldehyde. In addition, there were significant positive relationships between the UF-low formaldehyde and the bending strength and internal bonding strength of the particleboard, which allowed evaluation of the properties of the particleboard made with UF-low formaldehyde.

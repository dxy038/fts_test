Background: There is growing rise in rate of annual cesarean delivery worldwide. Considering the morbidity associated with cesarean section, a safe preventive strategy to reduce the use of this procedure is needed.
Objective: To estimate the effect of health education on the rate of cesarean section.
Methods: In an interventional study 440 pregnant women were randomly divided into 2 groups. The first group attended the educational classes while given usual prenatal care whereas the second group received the standard prenatal care alone. A month following delivery, every member of both groups was interviewed and a questionnaire completed by health care officer. 
Findings: While the total rate of cesarean section was 59.8%, the rate of c/s among the first and second groups was 41.41% and 74.8%, respectively. Also, the rate of elective c/s was 14.63% among the first group and 54.14% in second group.
Conclusion: Providing pregnant women with a prenatal educational supportive course could reduce the rate of cesarean section.

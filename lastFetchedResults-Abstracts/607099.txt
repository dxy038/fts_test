Introduction: Despite potential benefits of CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) systems, recent studies have cast some doubts on their role in reducing errors. CPOE systems with poorly designed interfaces have proven to cause dissatisfaction and introduce new kinds of errors in the ordering process. The main objective of this study is to identify problems related to a CPOE medication systemâ€™s design and determining their severities.
Methods: This cross sectional study investigated the views of nurses of Hormozgan Medical Science University regarding implementation of Computerized Physician Order Entry system. Data was collected using a researcher made questionnaire. The questionnaire content validity and reliability was previously approved. Data was analyzed by SPSS 20 software using frequency distribution, percentage and test mining.
Results: Among the participants, 95.5% agreed to use a medical document system, 87.8% declared that it saved staff's time. About 97.7% considered it as a help to achieve a high level of patient safety and 90% thought that it would increase the reliability of data. About 86.8% were concerned about the privacy issues of CPOE and 334 (83.4%) people thought that this system lacks the support of medical staff. 
Conclusion: CPOE increases the quality and safety of healthcare. Using CPOE systems improves the security and quality of health care and reduces errors. Therefore, according to present conditions, implementation of this system must be taken under consideration.

Objective
udy was designed to investigate the relative amount of MUC5B and MUC7 in minor salivary glands in children and adults, in order to test the hypothesis that secretion of salivary mucins changes between childhood and adulthood.
s
 individuals in the age-groups 3-year-olds, 14-year-olds, and young adults 20–25 year-olds were recruited. Sialopapers were applied on the labial and the buccal mucosa and then placed in the Periotron 8000 (Proflow™) for calculation of the amount of saliva. The assessment of MUC5B and MUC7 was carried out in an ELISA using the LUM5B-2 and the LUM7-1 antiserum, respectively.
s
and MUC7 were detected in the labial minor gland saliva in all age groups. In buccal gland saliva, only a few individuals in each age group showed detectable amounts of the mucins. In the labial area, a significantly lower level of MUC7 was noted in 3-year-olds compared with adults.
sion
sults indicate a site-dependent difference in minor gland mucin secretion and an age-related difference in the labial gland secretion of MUC7.

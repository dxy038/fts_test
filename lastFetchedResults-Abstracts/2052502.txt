We are developing the CALorimetric Electron Telescope, CALET, mission for the Japanese Experiment Module—Exposed Facility, JEM-EF, of the International Space Station, ISS. Major scientific objective is a search for nearby cosmic ray sources and dark matter by carrying out a precise measurement of the electrons in 1 GeV–20 TeV and the gamma-rays in 20 MeV-several TeV. CALET has, moreover, a capability to measure cosmic ray H, He and heavy ions up to 1000 TeV. It will also have a function to monitor the solar activity and the gamma-ray bursts. The phase A study has started on a schedule of the launch in early 2014 by the H-II Transfer Vehicle, HTV, for a 5-year observation.

Summary form only given. The objective of this project is to develop a user access system for the Microscale Process Engineering Laboratory (MPEL) at San Jose State University (SJSU). The system implements hardware/software locks that limit tool use to authorized users only. The MPEL at SJSU is a 5,000 sq. ft. instructional facility that is also used for research projects and industry collaboration. Based on the size of the facility and its support infrastructure, it is critical that the user access system be very lean and sustainable for the limited staffing available. In addition to the interlock system, the necessary system functions include a database with user information and authorization levels that can easily be modified by the lab managers. Preventing unauthorized tool use, or any use in the case of a tool that is down, will help maintain user safety and prevent tool damage. Individual user and tool hours are logged to add user accountability, budget tracking, and improve tool maintenance. This project evaluates trade-offs between having a centralized master computer that communicates with "child" computers stationed at each major functional area of the lab and having independent computers located separately at each functional area. Each option has benefits and costs related to expense, sustainability and usability. The implemented system will provide SJSU\Â´s MPEL with a lean and sustainable user access system that will improve safety, maintainability and quality.

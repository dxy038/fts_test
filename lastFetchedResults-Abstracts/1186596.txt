In this paper, a multi-objective optimisation procedure, based on the adoption of genetic algorithms, is presented. The optimal configuration with minimum weight and minimum cost of a damage resistant stiffened, composite panel with buckling constraints has been determined. The numerical procedure is based on an in-house optimisation code used in conjunction with the ANSYS FEM code. The presence of both continuous and high sensitivity discrete design variables, suggested for GA the adoption of a special bit-masking data structure able to increase the overall computational efficiency. Optimal configurations of the stiffened panel, are finally analysed and discussed focusing on the influence of the damage resistance constraint on the overall costs.

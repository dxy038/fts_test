Land-use planning is a science that determines the type optimum of land-use through studying the ecological characteristics of the land as well as its socio-economic structure. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the land-use and natural resources for future sustainable land planning using GIS. In this study, the Makhdoomâ€™s systematic method was used to analyze the ecological and resources maps of the study area. At first, ecological capability maps of different land-uses including forest, agriculture, rangeland, environmental conservation, ecotourism and development of village, urban and industry were developed by overlaying geographical maps in GIS for the township. The final step of this study was the prioritization of land-uses considering the ecological and socio-economic characteristics of the study area using a quantitative model. The results indicated that the maximum area of proposed use was 39.30 % that was related to range and dry farmingand minimum area of proposed use was 3.3 % which was related to irrigation agriculture with range.

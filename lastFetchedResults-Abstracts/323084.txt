Gaucher disease, the most common glycolipid storage disorder, is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly and skeletal involvement. Enzyme replacement therapy in both the high- and low-dose regimens has been shown to be effective in reducing the organomegaly and improving the hematological parameters of symptomatic patients with type I disease. Herein we report subjective and objective responses of bone-related complications after 2 to 4 years of low-dose enzyme replacement therapy in 14 adult type I patients with severe skeletal involvement pre-treatment. We discuss our results relative to those reported in patients on the high-dose regimen, as well as with reference to a single patient who developed new avascular necrosis despite objective improvement in radiological studies.

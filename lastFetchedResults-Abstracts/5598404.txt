We consider the reliable robust tracking controller design problem against actuator faults and control surface damages for a LTI system with input disturbance. First, models of actuator faults and control surface damages are presented. Then a reliable tracking controller design method is developed, which guarantees the closed-loop system stability, optimizes the tracking performance of the system in normal operations, and maintains an acceptable low-level tracking performance of the system in the event of actuator faults and/of control surface damages. This method is based on LQ/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> tracking performance indices and multi-objective optimization in terms of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example of an F-16 aircraft model and its simulation results are given

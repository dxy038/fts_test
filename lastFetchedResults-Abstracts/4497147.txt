This work presents the sequential symbol synchronizer based on pulse comparison by positive transitions at quarter rate (txp/4). Their performance is compared with a reference synchronizer by both transitions at the rate (tx). For the reference and proposed synchronizer we consider two versions which are the manual (m) and the automatic (a). The objective is to study the four synchronizers and evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal Noise Ratio).

In this paper, a non-linear model predictive controller (NMPC) is formulated as an objective function aiming to track the rotor speed for a wind turbine. The proposed controller is applied directly to the nonlinear model of wind turbine without the use of any linearization technique. When compared to methods reported in the literature, the simulation results showed that the proposed controller outperforms what has been reported before.

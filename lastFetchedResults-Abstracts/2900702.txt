Peripheral I/O data-rates for PCs and mobile computing platforms continue to scale to meet high-bandwidth applications including high-resolution displays and large-capacity external storage. The bandwidth requirements will soon exceed the data-rates of current standards such as PCI Express and USB. A low-power low-cost serial link is needed for the next-generation peripheral interface that can scale to 32Gb/s per lane. Recent publications have demonstrated 28 to 32Gb/s rates [1-2]. However, the circuit power and channel characteristics are not suitable for mainstream PC and mobile markets. A low-profile connector and cable assembly prototype is developed for these markets, where the link architecture and design are optimized for the channel characteristics. This paper describes a data-rate-scalable 32Gb/s serial link that features a bidirectional transceiver, source-series terminated (SST) 3-tap FFE, a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) with an active inductor, a 6-tap DFE, and clock calibration and adaptation circuitry.

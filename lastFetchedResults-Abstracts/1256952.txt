The objective of this study is to produce and characterize self-colored dental zirconia blocks by using zirconia raw material having Fe2O3 content. Five different compositions with different amounts of Fe2O3 were prepared by using two different raw materials. The shaped samples were sintered at 1500 Â°C for 2 h. Color differences, phase formations, microhardness, fracture toughness, and microstructures of the specimens were investigated. Self-colored zirconia blocks and frameworks of desired physical and mechanical properties for dental restorations can be produced by using zirconia raw material having Fe2O3 content.

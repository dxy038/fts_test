The properties of virtually all real-world materials change with time, causing their bidirectional reflectance distribution
functions (BRDFs) to be time varying. However, none of the existing BRDF models and databases take time variation into
consideration; they represent the appearance of a material at a single time instance. In this paper, we address the acquisition, analysis,
modeling, and rendering of a wide range of time-varying BRDFs (TVBRDFs). We have developed an acquisition system that is capable
of sampling a material’s BRDF at multiple time instances, with each time sample acquired within 36 sec. We have used this acquisition
system to measure the BRDFs of a wide range of time-varying phenomena, which include the drying of various types of paints
(watercolor, spray, and oil), the drying of wet rough surfaces (cement, plaster, and fabrics), the accumulation of dusts (household and
joint compound) on surfaces, and the melting of materials (chocolate). Analytic BRDF functions are fit to these measurements and the
model parameters’ variations with time are analyzed. Each category exhibits interesting and sometimes nonintuitive parameter trends.
These parameter trends are then used to develop analytic TVBRDF models. The analytic TVBRDF models enable us to apply effects
such as paint drying and dust accumulation to arbitrary surfaces and novel materials.

A multi-objective evolutionary programming (MOEP) based approach to thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) and static VAr compensators (SVC) tuning has been investigated in this paper. The coordinate design problem of TCSC and SVC is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the system transient stability is improved by minimizing several system behavior measure criterions. Then, MOEP is used to design the two FACTS controller parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme was demonstrated with a two-area and four-machine power system. In comparison with separate design of the two controllers, significant improvements in dynamic performance of the system are achieved

Objective
form disorders (SFD) are defined by symptoms that lack medical explanation. This study examined the type and pattern of patients' causal attributions using a new semistructured interview technique
s
usal Attributions Interview allows to assess and weigh 15 common explanations of physical symptoms. Attributions given by 79 patients with SFD were compared with those obtained from 187 chronic pain patients.
s
st–retest reliabilities of the interview-elicited attributions were satisfactory to good. SFD patients attributed most of their symptoms to mental/emotional problems (46.9%) and somatic disease (41.1%), while the pain sample preferred physical overloading/exhaustion (56.1%), daily hastiness/time pressure (41.7%), somatic disease (39.6%), and weather influence (39.0%). On average, SFD patients chose 2.57 and pain patients 3.86 different attributions for each symptom. These numbers were substantially larger than those of initial spontaneous attributions. Correspondence analysis revealed underlying dimensions with three groups labeled “environmental,” somatic,” and “psychological/stress.” While pure environmental attributions were rare (1.1%), somatic factors were chosen for 28.3% of the symptoms, psychological/stress for 22.1%, and the combination of both for 25.6%. Approximately 10% were attributed in a multicausal sense to all three groups. Depression was found to correlate positively with psychological/stress and negatively with somatic attributions.
sion
sults do not support the perspective that SFDs generally result from poor acknowledgement of emotional factors. SFD and chronic pain showed distinguishable attributional patterns.

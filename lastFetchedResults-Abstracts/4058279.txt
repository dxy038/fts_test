This paper presents a dc microgrid including a switched-reluctance generator (SRG) with isolated boost dc-dc converter, a battery energy storage system, and a single-phase three-wire (1P3W) load inverter for generating ac 220/110 V 60-Hz outputs. The 400-V dc grid is established by the SRG with dc 48-V output followed by a current-fed push-pull (CFPP) dc-dc converter. The robust commutation and dynamic control schemes are developed for the SRG to have excellent output performances. For providing the domestic load power sources, a 1P3W transformerless 220/110 V inverter is established. A master and slave robust control schemes are proposed to yield balanced sinusoidal output voltage waveforms in both voltage outputs under varying load conditions. To improve the dc grid power supporting reliability, a battery energy storage system with bidirectional buck-boost interfacing converter is established. It can support the common dc bus voltage immediately when the main power source fault occurs. Conversely, the battery bank can be charged from the common dc bus through the same converter. Particularly, an auxiliary charger formed by a flyback switch-mode rectifier is equipped to allow the battery to be charged from the plug-in utility power as the long duration of microgrid fault occurs. Normal operation and good operating performance of the established microgrid are verified experimentally.

Preantral follicle can be considered as an alternative source of oocyte for in vitro production of embryos. The objective of the present study was to standardize a procedure for the isolation of large preantral follicles (&gt;150–500 μm) from buffalo ovaries and to determine the effect of season and the presence of corpus luteum on the recovery rate of the large preantral follicles. A combined enzymatic cum mechanical approach was adopted to recover the large preantral follicles. In the first experiment, the ovarian cortical pieces were suspended in trypsin (1000–1500 BAEE units for milligrams of solid) and incubated at various temperatures for different periods, i.e. (1) trypsin (1%), 37 °C for 10 min; (2) trypsin (1%), 37 °C for 10 min + 4 °C for 3 h; (3) trypsin (0.5%), 37 °C for 20 min; (4) trypsin (0.25%), 37 °C for 20 min. Although there was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) among the different protocols, the first protocol yielded more follicles (3.2, 2.6, 1.8 and 1.5 per ovary, respectively). Hence, the first protocol was selected and used in the second and third experiments. In the second experiment, the effect of season, i.e. peak breeding season (October–March) versus low breeding season (April–September) was evaluated on the recovery rate of the large preantral follicles. The recovery rate of large preantral follicles from the ovaries during the peak breeding season was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater (9.92 ± 0.85 per ovary) than that of the low breeding season (4.95 ± 0.27 per ovary). In the third experiment, effect of the presence of corpus luteum on the recovery rate of large preantral follicles was studied. There was a significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher yield of large preantral follicles from the ovaries with corpus luteum (8.05 ± 0.88 per ovary) than for the ovaries without corpus luteum (4.57 ± 0.43 per ovary). This study confirms that the large preantral follicles can be isolated from buffalo ovaries using a combination of enzymatic cum mechanical methods and that more large preantral follicles can be recovered during the peak breeding season and from the ovaries having corpus luteum.

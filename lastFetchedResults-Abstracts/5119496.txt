This paper describes the efforts of designing an innovative interdisciplinary general engineering program which was recently introduced as part of the newly shaped engineering department at the American University of Iraq in Sulaimani (AUIS). Current progress includes building a state- of-the-art science building that will accommodate the physics and chemistry laboratory, completing the construction of the engineering basement that will accommodate state-of-the-art laboratories to complement engineering fundamentals and capstone courses, and meeting staffing needs. The objective of the program is to create an ABET-accredited program that is unique to the region and serves the development of the regionÂ´s economy and people. The paper describes the details of the general engineering program, curriculum development, laboratory facilities, experiences, faculty and staff needs. It also touches upon the theme of global engineer. A concluding section is offered that presents the development and implementation of such a program in a rapidly developing post-conflict society in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.

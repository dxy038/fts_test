Clinical practice and research rely increasingly on analytic approaches to patient data. Visualization enables the comparative exploration of similar patients, a key requirement in certain clinical decision support systems. Patient data is complex and heterogeneous, may have different formats, reside in various structures and carry different semantics. This makes the comparison and analysis of clinical data a challenging task. Most medical applications visualize patient data without integrating additional semantic information to structure the analysis. Our objective is to map patient data onto relevant fragments of ontologies and inferred ontological structures as a basis for improved patient data visualization, comparison, and analysis. Two visualization scenarios that we have implemented using the patient data acquired in the Health-e-Child project will be presented and their clinical evaluation will be provided.

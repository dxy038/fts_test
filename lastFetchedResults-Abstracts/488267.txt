One of the urgent needs of Persian language is to translate and oppose thousands of emerging technical foreign terms, entering and invading it through confronting with various branches of science and technology. It is obvious that satisfying such a need requires the translators' knowledge and practice. In addition to coining new words, on the other hand, it is necessary for them to study the words already coined by the others so that, finding their strengths or weaknesses, inappropriate words can be abandoned. The present article follows this objective. Having introduced general theories of word coinage, it criticizes the translations of forty foreign words and finally offers alternatives for the majority of them. The revised words have been translated by the Academy of Persian Language and Literature, and the Foundation of Culture (in the time of Pahlavi regime, with the same function as the Academy of Persian Language and Literature has today).

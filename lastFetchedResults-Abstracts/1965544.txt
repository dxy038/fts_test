Paraffin emulsions are important in technological applications such as coating in the food packaging industry or to provide waterproof properties to particleboard panels. Small particle size (about 1.0 μm) and low polydispersity are required to form stable paraffin emulsions for these applications. In this context, the main objective of the present work is to study the influence of the surfactant system and the emulsification process on the properties of paraffin emulsions. A high pressure homogenizer was used to prepare the emulsions and its characterization was made by means of optical microscopy, laser diffraction and electrophoretic mobility measurements. Emulsions were prepared as a function of the ionic/nonionic surfactant ratio, the total surfactant concentration and the homogenization pressure. A simple theoretical model to predict the minimum particle size was used, assuming that surfactant is either at the oil–water interface or as monomer in the external phase. Experimental and theoretical data are on good agreement and the formation of stable emulsions is explained according to such model. This result could be of prime importance in order to formulate new paraffin emulsions.

Various image filtering strategies have been effective, but most algorithms are to fail in general and create artifacts or remove image fine structures. Hence we propose a novel image filter based on grey polynomial model(GPM) to reduce image noise. The basic conceptions of grey polynomial model are described. The new image filter adopts each noisy pixel´s neighborhoods to rectify its intensity value. In addition, the QR decomposition is used to enhance the algorithm´s robustness. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, can do better than some more popular denoising methods, such as the median filter and GM(1,1) model, on the removal of low-density impulse noise. Finally, the improved algorithm can effectively eliminate image noise and achieve better denoising effect from both subjective and objective aspects, while preserve the image´s textures and edges.

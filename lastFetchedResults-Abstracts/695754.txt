Employment of Optimization technologies for improving the performance of is not a new idea and various kinds of technologies have been used for improving the productivity capacity of the reservoirs. As a general rule for these optimizing methods, decision variables are minimized or maximized for an objective function. This method has its own limitations. As the main aim in this paper, by combining genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic, the optimal outflow hydrograph is identified based on the inflow hydrograph for the reservoir of the Karun3 dam. For this purpose, using genetic algorithm, the optimal parameters are determined for Sugeno method in Fuzzy logic. In this problem, the objective function is defined as various goals pursued by flood controlling such as minimization of outflow peak, reduction of damages in downstream areas, flood storage, and maintenance and final level of water stored near optimal for resolving future water requirements, and the like are considered . Comparing the results to other methods, this method is promising at optimization of reservoir performance.

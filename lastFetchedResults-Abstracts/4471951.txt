PENANT (Performance Enhanced Navigation using Neural Network Technology) represents a new approach to fault detection, identification, and reconfiguration (FDIR) for integrated multi-sensor aircraft navigation systems. This paper reports the major results of the PENANT feasibility study, a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract sponsored by Air Force Wright Laboratory. The objective of this effort was to determine whether PENANT can provide improved diagnostic capability and navigation accuracy, compared to standard innovations-monitoring techniques. The PENANT concept was tested in a reduced-scale simulation that incorporates many of the critical features of an integrated INS/GPS aircraft navigation system. The results indicate that this approach may be useful for real-time, onboard FDIR

In this paper, we discussed about a new mobile robot navigation technique, which will be used for home security. The objective is to perform indoor navigation efficiently and at the same time make the cost of the device as low as possible so as to make it commercializable. Here, we proposed an approach based on recognition of two infrared generated ceiling spots, which remains invisible to human eyes but easily captured by infrared camera. Then we use this image to locate the position of a robot and finally control the robot to the destination in the room, for example to its charging station. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in real environment and opens new doors for future research.

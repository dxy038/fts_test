The resource-constraint project scheduling problem is modeled as a zero-one integer programming model. The model considers many important characteristics of project scheduling including activity preemption, renewable and non-renewable resources, time-resource tradeoffs, and multiple objectives. Solution algorithms are developed for three single objective problems (time minimization, cost minimization, and resource leveling) and for the preemptive goal programming model that includes time, cost and resource leveling objectives.

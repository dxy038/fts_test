In this paper, we use the interval-valued fuzzy sets to derive linear programming in the fuzzy sense from crisp multiple objective programming. For many practical problems, if we just used the general fuzzy sets, it may not be quite well to describe the real situation. That is the reason why we use the interval-valued fuzzy sets and the method in Zimmerman to fuzzify the crisp linear programming.

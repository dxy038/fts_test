The well known advantages from PV based power generation (PVPG) are pollution free, short-term installation and long life operation. However, disadvantages are also associated, for e.g. dependency of generated power on weather conditions, and researchers are putting efforts to overcome them by application of power electronic based devices and techniques like maximum power point (MPPT) in the systems consisting of PV sources. DC-DC and DC-AC converters are the commonly used power electronic devices to transfer the power from PV source to load with good quality. The output voltage level which can be attained in DC-AC converter cannot be greater than the input voltage or else to attain the higher output voltage greater than the input dc voltage (normally lower) in the case of a DC-DC boost converter high voltage gain is required. To achieve (i) higher AC voltage from a given DC voltage, and (ii) higher DC voltage from a lower DC voltage boost inverter and Transformer Less (TL) boost converter have been proposed in the literature. However, the DC voltage source considered is of fixed type. This paper deals with the above said boost inverter and TL boost converter connected to a PV source/module. The main objective is to supply/transfer the power generated from the PV module to the load, by maintaining higher voltage at the output side of the converter compared to that of the input DC voltage received from the PV module. The control of above said PV based power electronic converters for load voltage regulation is implemented by simple proportional-integral (PI) controllers. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance of PI controllers in maintaining the desired voltage at the load.

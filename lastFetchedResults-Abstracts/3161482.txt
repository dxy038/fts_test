In the conventional CATV, there is a limitation in introducing personalized broadcasting services and bidirectional broadcasting services due to the lack of technological bases. In addition, the conventional CATV requires the high cost of STB and has been burdened to invest infrastructures due to the weakness in the common use of infrastructures for providing services according to SO. Also, the large part of the content used in CATV services represents large scaled files and that requires its expansion ability for building large scaled storages. This study proposes a single-site system design that is a basic service for establishing the Cloud Computing service based next generation D-CATV in order to solve the existing problems and a virtualization plan that maintains at least of a minimum performance for such services while its expansion ability is ensured for providing safe services for the proposed system.

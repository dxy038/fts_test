The concept of Sensitivity Adaptive Feedback with Estimation Redistribution (SAFER) is reviewed. Explicit inclusion of a cost of estimation is accomplished by a sensitivity function approach. Redistribution of the effort the control expends on estimation is achieved through the choice of a sensitivity weighting matrix according to the accuracy required to achieve a given control objective. Dual effect is accomplished through the introduction of sensitivity to improve the estimation for the purpose of control. The SAFER control method is described using a single input single output representation of the system. An example is given to illustrate the behavior of the controller.

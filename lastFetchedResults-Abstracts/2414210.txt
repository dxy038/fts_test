Background: The association of endometriosis with hyperprolactinemia is controversial.
Objective: The present study aimed to determine the frequency of endometriosis and association of prolactin with endometriosis in infertile women.
Materials and Methods: 256 infertile women who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy for the evaluation of infertility, referred to Fatemezahra Infertility and Reproductive Health Research Center were included in a cross-sectional study. The presence of endometriosis was evaluated. To investigate the association of endometriosis with hyperprolactinemia, the patients whose infertility was not caused by endometriosis were included as control group. Serum prolactin (PRL) level was measured in both groups. The comparison of basal serum PRL levels between the two groups was performed, using independent t-test. One way ANOVA was used to determine PRL association with endometriosis stages.
Results: The frequency of endometriosis was found to be 29%. PRL levels were significantly higher in endometriosis group compared to control group (23.02±1.25 vs. 17.22±1.22 respectively, p=0.004). Statistically significant associations were found between staging of endometriosis and prolactin levels (p=0.01).
Conclusion: Hyperprolactinemia may be associated with endometriosis and its progression.

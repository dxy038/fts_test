In traditional electricity market unit commitment (UC) is done only for the reduction of operating cost. In the deregulated electricity market, for a secure and economical hourly generation schedule of the day ahead market, independent system operator (ISO) executes the security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. The objective of the paper is to develop scheduling algorithm using hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) for electric generation that accounts directly for system security requirements. The proposed SCUC formulation includes constraints, such as hourly power demand, system reserves, ramp up/down limits, minimum ON/OFF duration limits. The innovation of our approach is to capture the system security requirements within a network flow sub-problem that is solved in conjunction with the unit commitment problem. To solve such SCUC model, a binary coded particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is used for unit commitment master problem and real coded particle swarm optimization (RPSO) is used for the economic dispatch sub-problem. The effectiveness of the suggested method to solve the SCUC problem is validated on different test systems.

This study presents a MILP model to retrieve or get close to the early schedule of
disrupted container vessels. The model is applied on a real case study of Islamic
Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) considering container demands, and CO2
emissions. Sensitivity analysis on fuel inventory level shows the inevitable influence
of the fuel price and primary inventory level on cost of the ships. Variations in
unviability duration of the ships suggest that substantial changes in the objective
function are caused by omitting the port calls rather than speeding up the ships.

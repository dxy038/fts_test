A large number of grid cells are needed to simulate very large field reservoirs such as those in the Middle East. Pseudo relative permeability curves are used to reduce the dimensionality of reservoir simulation models and also to account for intra-cell rock property variations. Identifying the parameters affecting pseudo relative permeability curves is very important so that the model cells can be grouped in different categories in which appropriate pseudo relative permeabilities are generated for each group. The objective of this study is to identify the factors affecting pseudo relative permeability curves. Different reservoir rock and fluid properties were studied for an homogeneous 2D reservoir model. Validation of some curves is also done. The most pronounced effect on pseudo relative permeability curves was found to be caused by the reservoir dip angle. Layer thickness and PVT properties have some effect. Production rate and vertical to horizontal permeability ratio have no significant effect within the parameter ranges studied. While absolute permeability on low dip angle cases has no effect, absolute permeability effects on high dip angle cases needs consideration.

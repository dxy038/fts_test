Over the last few years, automated model generation approaches have rapidly gained importance as a sustainable methodology for verification of large, complex mix-signal SoCs (system-on-chips) and SiPs (system-in-packages). In this paper a novel approach termed multiple model generation system using delta operator (MMGSD) is developed for extracting either single-input single-output (SISO) or multiple-input single-output (MISO) macromodels from a SPICE netlist. This model generation process detects nonlinearity through variations in output error. The objective of using delta operator is to achieve transient impulse invariant transform. Examples of the application of MMGSD are presented for simple two-input systems incorporating a two-stage CMOS operational amplifier (op amp). We demonstrate the generated models are able to model various circuits with good accuracy.

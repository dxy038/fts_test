Most FPGA technology mapping approaches either target lookup tables (LUTs) or relatively simple programmable logic blocks (PLBs). Considering networks of PLBs during technology mapping has the potential of providing unique optimizations unavailable through other techniques. This paper proposes a Boolean matching approach for FPGA technology mapping targeting networks of PLBs. To overcome the demanding memory requirements of previous approaches, the Boolean matching problem is formulated as a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem. Since the SAT formulation provides a trade-off between space and time, the primary objective is to increase the efficiency of the SAT-based approach. To do this, the original SAT problem is decomposed into two easier SAT problems. To reduce the problem search space, a theorem is introduced to allow conflict clauses to be shared across problems and extra constraints are generated. Experiments demonstrate a 340% run time improvement and 27% more success in mapping than previous SAT-based approaches

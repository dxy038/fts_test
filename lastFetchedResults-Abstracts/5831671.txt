Through the theoretical analysis and the simulation verification methods, research the new Buck matrix rectifiers which used in PMSM (Permanent Magnet AC Synchronous Motor) of the elevator drive system, realize the four-quadrant operation of PMSM. We analyze the bidirectional flow of energy in-depth; especially giving a certain amount of analysis to matrix rectifierÂ´s working condition and energy feedback principle when it is in the state &#8220;energy feedback&#8221;. The method realizes the bidirectional energy transfer in approximately unity power factor on grid AC-side; the simulation results show the correctness of the method.

Transfer of knowledge through educational games is emphasized within the last decades to support the knowledge construction process, irrespective of the declining attention of the new scientific generation. With the research driven nature of founded projects at university, the challenge of knowledge transfer is even intensified by its specific and abstract character. This paper concentrates on the design of an educational game, which features entertainment and educational value at the same time in contrast to other approaches. Based on the presentation of educational and game objective, the game concept illustrates how results of transdisciplinary research can be transferred to the new scientific generation. Passing through the innovation process of a product-service-system of a fictitious company, the player accomplishes tasks, gaining a profound understanding of the innovation process, cycles within that process and the underlying methods. Therewith, the Cycle Labyrinth illustrates how abstract knowledge is imparted to the new scientific generation.

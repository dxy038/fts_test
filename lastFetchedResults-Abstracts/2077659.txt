Stream gradients of rivers bedrock in the Khuzestan province were calculated, using GIS and 50-m digital elevation models to discuss the distribution of knick zones. Gradients were classified into local and regional types based on the measurement lengths of stream gradients for 474 rivers having at least 10-km long in the study area. The transition rate from the local to regional gradients, i.e. the decreasing rate of gradient with increasing measurement length, is then obtained as the indicator of relative steepness of a river segment, which permits the objective identification of fluvial knick zones. Knick zones occur widely in the study area. The knick zones with large relative steepness near the outlets of large watersheds are related to the tectonic activity and most of them are actually close to the known locations of the active faults. The most important active faults in the study area are Mafaron, Agha-jari, Andakan, Lahbari, Mordehfel, Maron, North Behbahan Dezfol and Mishdagh. Knick zones occur along upstream steep reaches can be related to active hydraulic and erosional conditions regardless of geological or tectonic conditions. Effects of rock properties on the frequency and form of knick zones are observed, but they seem to play only a subordinate role. This study concludes that tectonics and geology are more important than topographic and hydraulic conditions in knick zone existence.

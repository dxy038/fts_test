We report on recent developments aiming at improving the accuracy and the performances of a discontinuous Galerkin time domain method (DGTD) for the simulation of time-domain electromagnetic wave propagation problems involving general domains and heterogeneous media. The common objective of the associated studies is to bring the method to a level of computational efficiency and flexibility that allows to tackle realistic applications of practical interest.

The vector control technique pioneered by Blaschke (1972) was initially developed for induction motor drives with the aim of optimising efficiency and dynamic performance. More recently vector control has been proposed for permanent magnet synchronous motors with the further objective of improving stability. Vector control clearly requires instantaneous control of stator phase currents. Early techniques focused on analogue hysteresis and ramp comparison current regulators. Fast digital signal processors have allowed digital implementations such as space vector modulation. A new vector control drive scheme is presented here, incorporating an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for pulse width modulation

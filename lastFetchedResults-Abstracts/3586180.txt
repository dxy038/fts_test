The optimization of the baseband pulse shape for full response CPM signals, when a noncoherent lowest complexity receiver is used, is carried out. The effective bandwidth is chosen as the objective of the optimization. In order to obtain the minimum error probability for high signal-to-noise ratio, orthogonal signaling is taken into consideration. A closed form for the optimum pulse shape, the value of the optimum modulation index and of the optimum effective bandwidth is determined. The power spectral density and the fractional out-of-band power have been compared with some phase functions considered in the literature

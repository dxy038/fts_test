High-accuracy positioning is applied in a variety of modern computer-controlled machines. The achievable precision is not only determined by the mechanical properties of the systems but strongly depends on the utilized control algorithms and the quality of the sensor signals. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how alternative position sensors influence the performance of a robust digital tracking controller consisting of a disturbance observer in the velocity loop, a feedback controller in the position loop, and a zero phase error tracking controller as feedforward controller. Two different sensor systems for an x-y positioning table are considered. While a digital encoder is attached to the actuating motor, a laser interferometer with a significantly higher resolution directly measures the position of the compliantly coupled table. The latter case represents a noncollocated system. After introducing the hardware setup, both the system identification and the controller design are briefly reviewed. The impact of the measurement device on the control performance and the optimal choice of the controller parameters are investigated in extensive experiments

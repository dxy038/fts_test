Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) communication systems invariably require good optical filters meeting stringent requirements on their amplitude response, the ideal being a perfectly rectangular filter. To achieve high bandwidth utilization, the phase response of these filters is of equal importance, with the ideal filter having perfectly linear phase and therefore constant time delay and no dispersion. This aspect of optical filters for WDM systems has not received much attention until very recently. It is the objective of this paper to consider the phase response and resulting dispersion of optical filters in general and their impact on WDM system performance. To this end we use general concepts from linear systems, in particular, minimum and nonminimum phase response and the applicability of Hilbert transforms (also known as Kramers-Kronig relations). We analyze three different classes of optical filters, which are currently being used in WDM systems and compare their performance in terms of their phase response. Finally, we consider possible ways of linearizing the phase response without affecting the amplitude response, in an attempt to approximate the ideal filter and achieve the highest bandwidth utilization

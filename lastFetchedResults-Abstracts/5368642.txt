The objective of this research is to analyze the accuracy of temperature prediction with numerical ocean modeling in the Gulf of Thailand during Typhoon Muifa. The samples are chosen by stratified random sampling method from raw data. The results show that there is no difference between the temperature of raw data and prediction at 0.01 significant levels. The accuracy of the model is about 79.71% when the mean square error of prediction does not exceed 0.5 Celsius.

In this paper, we present, verify and analyze the performance of JSDESLib (Java simple discrete-event simulation library). It is a simplified and easy-to-use Java-based library for the development of discrete-event simulation tools of parallel systems. Our main objectives are: to propose, develop and implement JSDESLib: as a parallel event-oriented simulation library that simplifies the development of simulation tools; with a next earliest event mechanism and communication management between entities. Other main objectives are: to verify and analyze the performance of JSDESLib. A secondary objective is to present some simulation tools that were developed with that library. The main contributions of this work are: the proposal, implementation and performance analysis of JSDESLib; simplicity and ease usage of a parallel-optimized implementation of that library.

Abstract The Seljuk period is one of the most brilliant periods in the history of Iran architectural art. Many instances of such architectural works can be found in Isfahan, the political and cultural capital of Iran. Following the political and religious developments in capital, Ardestan considered as one major active center. This led to some changes in Jame Mosque of Ardestan over the time. Jame Mosque of Ardestan is one of the architectural masterpieces of Iran that has been experienced extensive changes during its life. The main objective of this study is to review Jame Mosque of Ardestan. This study analyzes and reviews the formation process of this mosque from the initial state to the present day. Interpretive-Historical research method was used to conduct this study using historical texts as well as contrastive and comparative analysis of related historical buildings. Therefore, this study is mainly based on providing documentaries of a journalistic nature and field studies. Reflection on opinions of researchers and extension of their view to existing building and eventually completion of prior information provided valuable conclusions regarding clearer building developments in different periods. Therefore, the ambiguity of historical layers is largely reduced in this study (parts of which have been ignored so far). Moreover, this study considers the space factor ( this factor has not been considered in most resources) to help understanding of the building formation process.

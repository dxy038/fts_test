The problem of developing an optimal structure of N-version software system presents a kind of very complex optimization problem. This causes the use of deterministic optimization methods inappropriate for solving the stated problem. In this view, exploiting heuristic strategies looks more rational. In the field of pseudo-Boolean optimization theory, the so called method of varied probabilities (MVP) has been developed to solve problems with a large dimensionality. Some additional modifications of MVP have been made to solve the problem of N-version systems design. Those algorithms take into account the discovered specific features of the objective function. The practical experiments have shown the advantage of using these algorithm modifications because of reducing a search space.

Robust alternative technology choices are required in the paradigm shift from the current crude oil-reliant transport fuel platform to a sustainable, more flexible transport infrastructure. In this vein, fast pyrolysis of biomass and upgrading of the product is deemed to have potential as a technology solution. The objective of this review is to provide an update on recent laboratory research and commercial developments in fast pyrolysis and upgrading techniques. Fast pyrolysis is a relatively mature technology and is on the verge of commercialisation. While upgrading of bio-oils is currently confined to laboratory and pilot scale, an increased understanding of upgrading processes has been achieved in recent times.

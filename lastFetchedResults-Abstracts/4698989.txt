In the daily activity of intercity high-speed railway traffic, two types of trains are designed to operate in the same double track railway system, and the circulation frequencies are very high. In this study, a multi-objective re-scheduling model is developed in order to satisfy the mixed operation policy with two types of passenger trains. Also an optimization approach based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is introduced into the re-scheduling railway traffic when a disturbance has occurred.

Broadcasting in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) usually involve fixed transmission power that covers, for example an area within 250 meters. However, it is often unnecessary to broadcast using fixed power because a node that needs to be covered may just be 100 meters away. By reducing the transmission power enough to cover this node, energy expenditure would be reduced, thus, prolonging the lifetime of a battery-powered MANET. Existing works on variable power broadcasting based on local information are effective in achieving this objective. However, they are not optimized and can be improved by dynamically adjusting the transmission power based on where a broadcast message comes from. This paper proposes simple mechanisms based on local knowledge to adjust the transmission power dynamically and incorporates a timer suppression mechanism to further enhance the effectiveness of the protocols in reducing energy expenditure. Results of simulation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements.

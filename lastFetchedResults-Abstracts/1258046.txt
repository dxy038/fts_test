"Peace" as ‎‏‌‏the one of fundamental concepts in social and political studies has been considered by ‎‎many scholars and has been several definitions. Most definitions of the concept of peace are ‎versus of ‎war and defined by the negative approach, the "absence of war”. New approaches by ‎using positive ‎and proactive view and in order to establish lasting peace, the concept do not ‎define versus of war, ‎but all offensive factors that disturbing the peace are considered and by ‎choosing inner and mental ‎perspective are seeking to build sustainable peace.‎
But, comparing the definition of the Quran about ‎peace shows us the similarities and difference ‎in this field. Telling words in the Quran, which is ‎equivalent to the conventional peace-term, is ‎‎Selm. Selm by two shapes "Selm" and "Salm" represent ‎faithful - internal peace and objective – ‎exterior peace. Accompany of the Selm in the Holy Quran with ‎concepts like justice, rights, ‎dignity and faith provides a different definition of peace. Islamic peace has ‎inner and positive ‎view to the peace, which shall be drawn it in a positive approach to fair terms and ‎holy purposes ‎and the next value of peace is the premise of religion and justice goal and it is not an ‎absolute ‎and final value that achieving it in any way became higher goal than the no peace section‎.

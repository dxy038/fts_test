The impact of alternative drug policy objectives,
specifically harm reduction/harm minimisation
or prohibition, is unclear. The literature
is confusing. This article conceptualises
the causal connection between drug
consumption and health harm (or reduced
health status) then clarifies the implication of
‘drug related harm’. By applying some geometrical
tools from economics, the choice of policy
objective is analysed. The preferences of policy
advocates are then incorporated. Policy advocates
are conceived as arguing that decisionmakers
and consumers should adopt their preferences
between drugs and health harm. With
this approach, the difference between alternative
drug policies, in particular prohibition and
harm minimisation/reduction, is demonstrated

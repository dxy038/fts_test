Since lean concept has appeared many works have been done on decreasing or even eliminating of wastes such as extra inventory. Although these studies have not taken into account expected reliabilityseriously. So in this paper, a Multi-Objective Decision Making (MODM) model has been developedby viewpoint of these subjects. They are decreasing wastes and increasing system reliability. Wastesthat have been minimized are maintenance requirements (i.e. labor, spare parts, reserve system and productive maintenance activities) and maintenance system reliability that has been maximized is afunction of maintenance requirements. A set of SAIPA data has been used to run the case study and test the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed model.

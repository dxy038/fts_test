We consider a financial market in which there is a single stock. An investor is free to buy and sell this stock at any time, but when he does so he pays a transaction cost and he either pays a tax in the event of a gain or receives a tax credit in the event of a loss. The investorÂ´s objective is to choose a trading strategy that maximizes the long-run growth rate of this single security portfolio. We apply optimal stopping theory to solve this problem

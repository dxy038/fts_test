For the favour of data partition, colour image segmentation framework is an ideal choice. This is based on colour and texture features of an image. The main objective of the proposed work consists of a new method for the extraction of colour features that assess the input image in a colour representation. To achieve this, the proposed work used the opponent characteristics of the RGB and LAB colour spaces. The texture features are computed using a gabor filter. The prime role of this work rests in the integration of the colour and texture features with the aim of identifying the homogenous regions in the image. The accuracy for extraction of colour texture was established by the proposed method.

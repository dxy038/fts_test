During the last few decades cultural issues have been more in architectural researches. It caused to concentrate some branches of these studies to the above issue. According to the extent of cultural issues and the diversity of its influence on architecture, different researchers by having attention to their opinion about the culture and architecture and their sense of what is needed, try to relate these areas in different methods. This has caused some researchers to have intention to enter in this field, are bewildered that how to use the previous studies. So it’s important that how these issues are examined in the researches. The diversity of concepts in culture and the variety of their entry in architecture, cause researchers to choose different methods in their study and knowledge which can be used in future research. This paper by recognizing some researchers’ view about cultural and architectural issues and their techniques to relate them together with the objective of finding a common policies in desired researchers. In this respect, by selecting several researche's performance in this context, their studies in architecture and their view about culture are pointed out and then in order to perform the desired research, their chosen methods were analyzed. The result of this paper could show that every research by having consider a particular dimension of architecture and defining a bounded meaning of culture, will try to obtain the desirable  result. In other words in studies on the relationship between architecture and culture, the first important step is attempting to determine the discussed area in every subject. In this article by paying attention to the type of viewpoints on culture and consider the dimension of architecture, a framework can be obtain to define the used techniques to analyze obtained information in architecture and culture.

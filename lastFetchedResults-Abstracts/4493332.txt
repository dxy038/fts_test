The different power theories as described in literature to control shunt active filters are compared with regard to their performance under normal, unbalanced voltage, unbalanced load, and distorted voltage conditions. The theoretical evaluation is done on a three-phase system with diode rectifier. Since the objective is to evaluate the performance of the algorithms, system dynamics are not included in the simulation model

This paper proposes a new objective assessment method for image quality based on content complexity and color similarity. Considering that human visual perception is sensitive to color distortion in compressed images due to different content complexity, we analyze the effects of image complexity and color similarity to images quality. Based on above analysis, we propose a method to establish the relationship between image quality and those two factors. The method includes the following steps: carrying out image color space conversion, calculating the image complexity and the color similarity, adjusting color similarity according to the different image complexity, and then obtaining the evaluation results. Experimental results show that our method can obtain a good consistency with the subjective results.

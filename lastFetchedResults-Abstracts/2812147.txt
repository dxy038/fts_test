In this paper, we study an optimal power bidding and scheduling problem for a microgrid (MG), which consists of distributed generators (DGs), battery storage units, a large garage with many charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs), MG local load, and renewable energy sources (RESs).We propose to utilize EVs as a dynamic energy storage facility to accommodate the variability of RESs in a realistic economic model for the electricity market. The power scheduling and bidding problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming problem considering the uncertainties of RESs and electricity price. Specifically, a multi-objective function is introduced to balance the tradeoff between maximizing the MG revenue and minimizing the MG operating cost. Importantly, appropriate penalty metrics capturing involuntary load shedding, renewable energy curtailment, and bid deviation are integrated into the objective function. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework in enhancing the operation efficiency of the MG, reducing curtailment of renewable energy resources compared to the conventional scheme and flexibility of the proposed framework in balancing different design objectives.

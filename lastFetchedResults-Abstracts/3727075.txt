A bidirectional gate is described which would allow information contained in one register to be transferred to another register or vice versa. The rotate/shift functions may be implemented by gating the data between two flip-flop registers through the shifted or skewed gates connecting the two. The unique property of bidirectional transfer of data signals between two registers permits a simplified and interesting design of a rotate and shift circuit. The implementation of this rotate/shift circuit into a data processing configuration is also illustrated.

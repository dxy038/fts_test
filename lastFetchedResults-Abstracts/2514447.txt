Objective(s): The main objective of this study was to investigate the variations of β-endorphin (β-EP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) mice as well as the regulatory mechanism of prednison.
Materials and Methods: Sixty BALB/c mice were randomly divided into control group, model group and prednison intervention group. ITP mice model was duplicated by injecting with glycoprotein-antiplatelet serum (GP-APS) except in control group. After ITP disease model was successful established, prednison was used in prednison intervention group. The β-EP, VIP, 5-HT and NE contents of ITP mice were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Results:Compared with the values in control group, the detection values of VIP and 5-HT in model group declined, while the detection values of β-EP and NE increased. Compared with prednison intervention group, the detection values of VIP and 5-HT in model group increased, while the detection values of β-EP and NE showed no significant change.
Conclusion: In this study, the β-EP, VIP, 5-HT and NE contents in ITP mice injected with GP-APS were changed by prednison. It shows that prednison as the first-line therapy for ITP with effective hemostasis function is likely to increasing the contents of VIP and 5-HT. These results suggest the therapeutic value of prednison for the treatment of ITP.

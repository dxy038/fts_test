Objective: Our purpose was to report the cancers arising during a familial ovarian cancer screening program and investigate the tumorâ€™s clonality and association with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Study Design: Program participants with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer or peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma were identified and their demographic characteristics, ultrasonographic findings, CA 125 results, operative reports, and pathology slides reviewed. Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 , bcl-2 , HER-2/neu , and nm23 H1 expression was performed on tumor tissues from multiple metastatic sites, and germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were identified. Results: Three stage I ovarian cancers and 7 cases of peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma were diagnosed from among 1261 program participants. Ultrasonographic abnormalities triggered surgical exploration in all 3 cases of stage I disease. Elevated levels of CA 125 were the harbinger in 2 of 7 cases of peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma, abnormal ultrasonographic findings prompted diagnosis in 2 of 7 cases, and 3 of 7 women had abdominal symptoms 5, 6, and 16 months after screening. Results of immunohistochemical studies suggested multifocal disease in 5 of 7 patients with peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma. At least 3 of the patients with peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma carry BRCA1 185delAG mutations. Conclusion: Multifocal peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma may be a phenotypic variant of familial ovarian cancer, and screening strategies for these women cannot rely on ultrasonography and CA 125 testing to detect early disease.

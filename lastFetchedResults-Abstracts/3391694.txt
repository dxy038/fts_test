The objective of the present study is to show that the method of volume integral used in conjunction with the zeroth-order edge-based basis functions (de Carvalho and de Souza Mendes 1999) gives an accurate and stable solution for a metal-dielectric resonator, when the number of the basis functions remains relatively small. Special attention is paid to the resonator in the form of a thin dielectric layer backed by two metal sheets. The metal surface is described in terms of the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions.

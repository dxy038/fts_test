This paper employs an adaptive Vector
Evaluated Particle Swarm Optimization (VEPSO)
algorithm to tune optimal gains of a Proportional Integral
Derivative (PID) controller with low pass filter for Load
Frequency Control (LFC) scheme in an interconnected
power system that shift the system eigenvalues to the left
of a vertical line in the s-plane. The problem of robustly
tuning of practical PID based LFC design is formulated
as an optimization problem according to the time domainbased
objective function which is solved by the VEPSO
technique that has a strong ability to find the most
optimistic results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method a two-area interconnected power
system is considered as a test system under different
operating conditions. The eigenvalue analysis and the
nonlinear simulation results show the effectiveness of the
proposed PID to damp out oscillations and work
effectively over a wide range of loading conditions and
system configurations.

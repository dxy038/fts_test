Introduction & Objective: The observance of prescribing principles has the likelihood of correct medication and consequently patient's recovery and also reduces the amount of unnecessary costs. In this context, we tried to examine the rate of observance of prescription principles in Hamadan University of Medical Sciences teaching staff including attendees, assistants and interns and compared it with non-teaching staff including general physicians and doctorsâ€™ pre-scription.
Materials & Methods: The present study is a descriptive-analytical research with two-stage random sampling on the prescriptions presented to hospitals pharmacies and city pharmacies of Hamadan. A total of 800 prescriptions were collected from 15 pharmacies and the data were analyzed by t test, ANOVA and post hoc statistical tests.
Results: According to the analyses of the examined prescriptions,  average score of the observance of prescribing principles in non-teaching staff was more significant (10.1 vs. 9.6)  than teaching staff (P  < 0.05).In both groups, the doctors out-performed the rest of the group by far (10.6 and 11.5) and the interns had the lowest scores among the teaching staff (8.95). The average pharmaceutics the teaching and the non-teaching staff prescribed were 2.99and 3.24, respectively.
Conclusion: According to the results, in Hamadan like most of the cities in our country, the principles of prescribing are not well observed, compared to the other countries. In the prescrip-tions related to the teaching staff, the average number drugs prescribed was lower, but the observance of prescribing principles was higher. Therefore, it is recommended that more investigations should be done in order to find the reason(s) related to this non conformity and optimal solution should be presented

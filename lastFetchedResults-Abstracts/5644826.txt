An aggregator is designed for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) frequency regulation service. Active discharge of the plug-in electric vehicle is enabled utilizing the regulation signal to avoid the energy constraint. Some structural restrictions are investigated through the system review. In addition, the characteristics of regulation signal are retrieved though statistical analysis. Then, an objective function is defined considering the energy constraint and the target state-of-charge (SOC). The discharge is enforced through uneven distribution of the regulation signal. For this purpose, appropriate variables are employed during the formulation. Then, we convert the objective function into a quadratic form with additional constrains to solve it with the quadratic programming. Finally, the global constraints, dependencies among the vehicles, are eliminated through a prioritized scheduling method, hence avoiding the problem being intractable.

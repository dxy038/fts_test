In this paper, we will present an algorithm to quantize the infinite-precision coefficients of a recursive filter. This algorithm utilizes an objective function during quantization to ensure filterÂ´s characteristics. The underlying structural implementation is a 2-D lowpass filter which uses four 2-D allpass subfilters which are interconnected to each other. An example is provided to show the efficiency of this technique

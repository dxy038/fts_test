Background: Various blood cells with different functions are produced in bone marrow in a process called hematopoiesis.
Objective: The present study was conducted in order to evaluate the effect(s) of MS14, as an immunomodulator with natural origin (plant â€“marine) on the hematopoiesis.
Methods: Eight 6-8 weeks old female BALB/c mice were divided to control group (receiving normal saline) and MS14 group (receiving MS14 at 100 mg/kg). Administration of MS14 and normal saline prolongs for five days, and then the mice were anaesthetized and killed. Smear of peripheral blood cells was provided and bone marrow cells were counted and cultured for 48 h. Erythropoietin (20 ng/ml) was added to half of samples.
Results: 5 days administration of 100 mg/kg MS14 has augmented the percent of red blood cell of bone marrow (about 2 times). An increase (about 60%) in the percent of peripheral blood neutrophils has been observed as well. Erytroid colonies in bone marrow culture have been increased about 2 times in MS14 group e.i. the mean colony number in each well increased from 7 in control group to 14 in MS14 group and at the presence of erythropoietin from 13 colonies in control to 23 in MS14 group.
Conclusion: According to increasing effect of MS14 on the number of erytroid colonies and percent of red blood cells, it can be concluded that hematopoietic processes not only does not adversely affected or inhibited by MS14 but could be significantly augmented when MS14 adminstered.

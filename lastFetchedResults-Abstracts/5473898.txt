The cross docking is an innovative distribution strategy for transshipment of time-sensitive products. In this research we develop a model for scheduling of a cross docking warehouse with focus on delivery time window. The objective of the model is to minimize the cost of distribution, including earliness and tardiness costs, and inventory holding cost. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer program. Using LINGO 12.0 it is found that our proposed method can calculate the total cost with short computation time.

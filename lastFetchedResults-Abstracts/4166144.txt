We consider stochastic neural networks, the objective of which is robust prediction for spatial control. We develop neural structures and operations, in which the representations of the environment are preprocessed and provided in quantized format to the prediction layer, and in which the response of each neuron is binary. We also identify the pertinent stochastic network parameters, and subsequently develop a supervised learning algorithm for them. The on-line learning algorithm is based an the Kullback-Leibler performance criterion, it induces backpropagation, and guarantees fast convergence to the prediction probabilities induced by the environment, with probability one

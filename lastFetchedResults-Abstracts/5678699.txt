A Switched-current based Transient Response Testing (TRT) method is presented for functional testing of intelligent sensors interface circuits. An integral component of this method of on-chip testing involves inject a square, logical-amplitude stimulus into the circuit under test and to monitor the resulting impulse response. This paper focuses on the use of switched current circuits for sensor interface circuits testing including the technique of power supply current monitoring. This method can detect most of the important faults, especially those faults which have no effect on the functionality of the OpAmps and cannot be detected. The objective of this research is to determine key metrology infrastructure issues needed for developing the design reuse approach for testing of multi-technology System-on-a-Chip (SoC) devices.

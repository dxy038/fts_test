Objective
Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) is a rare primary headache whose origins are unclear. To seek information on its pathophysiology, we studied the trigeminal Aβ and Aδ pathways by recording trigeminal reflexes and laser evoked potentials (LEPs) in patients with SUNCT.
Methods
Trigeminal reflexes and LEPs were recorded in 11 consecutive patients. Ten patients had neuroimaging evidence documenting idiopathic SUNCT and one had a posterior fossa tumour that compressed the trigeminal nerve thus causing symptomatic SUNCT.
Results
Whereas the patients with idiopathic SUNCT had normal trigeminal reflex and LEP responses, the patient with symptomatic SUNCT had abnormal responses.
Conclusions
Our neurophysiological findings show that idiopathic SUNCT spares the trigeminal sensory pathways whereas symptomatic SUNCT does not.
Significance
Neurophysiological testing can easily differentiate the idiopathic and symptomatic forms of SUNCT. It also suggests that the two forms are pathophysiologically distinct entities.

Cellular relay networks prove to be a cost-effective approach that offers significant performance benefits in coverage extension, cell-edge throughput enhancement and increased spectral efficiency. Radio resource management for cellular relay networks, where the network topology is highly dynamic, is particularly challenging. The highly dynamic topology may be caused by an ever increasing number of users accessing Internet and other multimedia services using mobile devices carried by pedestrians, in a train or in vehicles. This paper studies the subcarrier allocation problem in highly dynamic cellular relay networks with an objective to maximize the overall throughput. This optimization problem is formulated and solved as an expectation maximization problem. Statistical multiplexing gain is explicitly explored to further improve the channel utilization and spectral efficiency. Numerical evaluations are performed which demonstrate that the proposed scheme offers higher system throughput and improved radio resource utilization compared with existing schemes.

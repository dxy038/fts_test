Proof of Retrievability (POR) and Provable Data Possession (PDP) systems these days are the most active area of research for data integrity check, which is outsourced to cloud service providers. In this work we surveyed data integrity proving schemes by reviewing different schemes in the area along with their efficiency and security considerations. The objective of this survey is to offer a state-of-the-art knowledge for new researchers, who are interested in this specific area, i.e., it helps in understanding the research work carried out for the last few years.

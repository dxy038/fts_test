Objective: Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies are highly specific markers for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and useful for predicting rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development and progression. We assessed the diagnostic value of anti-CCP antibodies in our patients with RA. Materials and Methods: Anti-CCP antibodies and rheumatoid factor (RF) titers were determined in 247 serum samples: 128 from RA patients, 119 from control group (48 from healthy controls, 71 from patients with rheumatic disease other than RA or hematologic malignancies).

Results: There were 128 (93 females, 35 males) patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 119 (78 females, 41 males) controls. The sensitivity of Anti-CCP was 66.40% for diagnosis of RA with a specificity of 94.11%. The sensitivity of RF was 69.53% and its specificity was 81.51%. Conclusion: In our patients Anti-CCP has a moderate sensitivity but high specificity for diagnosis of RA.

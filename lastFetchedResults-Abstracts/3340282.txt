In Auctioning goods intelligent agents have been used in a collaborative manner. Many agents come together and make a fully communicable multiagent system. This system will take decision on behalf of bidders and will work on various goal and objective which was decided by bidders. This system will improve the efficiency and decision taking ability in more transparent manner. Auctioneers can auction goods on more accurate price and participation of bidders will be more. It will reduce transactional and operational cost of auctioning. We will use JADE for making auctioning system where we will have n no. of bidders and sellers.

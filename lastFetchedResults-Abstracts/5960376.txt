Next generation MOT moves its focus to the higher value added services innovations by integrating more sophisticated service functions to the conventional products and systems. This paper provides a scheme for the newly emerging "service science" expected to support services innovations and derives practical methodology to integrate new services to the strategic technology roadmap and roadmappinng by introducing a new independent layer of services between the market and products layers. Here, the concept of "service" is widely defined as "a supporting activity to help an individual or organization to achieve its objective". Accordingly, it includes physical supporting functions, psychological supporting functions, intellectual supporting functions, spiritual supporting functions, as well as technological supporting functions provided through products. Valuating products and systems with their added services improves customer satisfaction and the total customer value should be considered as the summation of the products/system value, added services value, and individually user added value. As for a new methodology for managing the service integrated technology/products innovation, this paper proposes a service-integrated technology roadmap/roadmapping, which involves a new concept of functions, "requiring functions" and "supplying functions" to fill the gaps between the market and service layers, as well as the service and products layers

Objective. Polymorphisms of the p53 gene codon 72 have displayed less effective
function as tumor suppression and usually were associated with human cancer.
Methods. Present study analyzed DNA of 42 Yazd women with breast cancer in
compare with 40 healthy women to gain frequency of two alleles of p53 codon 72.
Results. The results appearanced that pro/pro genotype was associated with
increased breast cancer risk (OR = , 95% CI = ) (P-value=0.048)
and the proline allele (f.Pro=0.639) is higher than arginine in patients
(f.Arg=0.361) and proline in the healthy controls (f.Pro=0.524) (P-value=0.048)
This could be because the Pro allele has less apoptotic ability than the Arg and the
arginine allele most probable activates transcription more efficiently than the
proline variant.
Conclusion. Women with proline allele should be more prone to
breast cancer

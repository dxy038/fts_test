A simple and effective computerized optimization procedure for microwave filters is discussed. The basic idea is to integrate a fast and accurate electromagnetic (EM) solver, a filter design strategy, and two different optimization algorithms. The structural parameters to be modified are then chosen with the objective of improving the interaction between the EM solver and the optimization process. A simple example is discussed in detail indicating how the procedure is very simple and effective

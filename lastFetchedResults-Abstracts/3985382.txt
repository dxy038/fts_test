In a local area power system, all components of the system, including sources, loads, and distribution have multiple commitments and responsibilities. These commitments include serving the energy needs of a local load, but also maintaining the efficiency and stability of the overall system. Then, the control law of a power converter should consider these objectives, but also needs to anticipate the reaction of other converters within the power network. A differential game-theoretic approach is proposed to derive sliding surfaces that uses a componentÂ´s objective and operating characteristics to plan an optimal state trajectory during a transient without the need for communication channels or centralized control. The optimal trajectory includes considerations for maintaining local operation of the converter, as well as the stability of the system as a whole. This paper introduces a geometric control surface based on a change of variables that simply and effectively implements a power buffer function in multiple load converters within a power network and microgrids. The formulation and implementation of the optimal surfaces are presented, in addition to experimental validation of the new power buffer control law.

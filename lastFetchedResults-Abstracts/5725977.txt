The objective of this research is to test a model of electronic procurement (e-procurement) adoption behavior by small- to medium-sized enterprises (SME). We investigate the phenomenon from the perspective of buyer-seller relationship and argue that, value of e-procurement adoption, trust on supplier, trust on IT, power of e-procurement and power of suppliers are factors leading to SME´s adoption behavior. Research findings from the four case studies provide some evidence that the former four factors have significant effect on SME´s e-procurement adoption behavior when the last one does not. This study contributes to a better understanding of how and why SME in Hong Kong employ e-procurement using a snapshot approach. Practical and theoretical implications are also provided.

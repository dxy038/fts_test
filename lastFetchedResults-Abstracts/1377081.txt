This paper proposes a tracking scheme for tracking multiple workers on construction sites using video cameras. Prior work has compared several contemporary tracking algorithms on construction sites and identified several difficulties, one of which included the existence of interacting workforce. In order to address the challenge of multiple workers within the cameraâ€™s field of view, the authors have developed a tracking algorithm based upon machine learning methods. The algorithm requires several sample templates of the tracking target and learns a general model that can be applied to other targets with similar geometry. A parameterized feature bank is proposed to handle the case of variable appearance content. The tracking initialization has been discussed for different types of video cameras. A multiple tracking management module is applied to optimize the system. The principal objective of this paper is to test and demonstrate the feasibility of tracking multiple workers from statically placed and dynamically moving cameras.

The objective of the SEAMS (Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-managing Systems) workshops is to consolidate the interest in the software engineering community on autonomic, self-managing, self-healing, self-optimizing, self-configuring, and self-adaptive systems. SEAMS provides a forum for researchers to share new results, raise awareness, and promote collaboration within the community. The SEAMS 2007 workshop builds on the great success of SEAMS 2006 at ICSE in Shanghai to assess progress and identify challenges in this area.

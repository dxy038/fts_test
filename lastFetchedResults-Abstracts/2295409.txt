In this study, a carbon paste electrode modified with carbon nanotubes and benzoylferrocene (BF) was used to prepare a novel electrochemical sensor. The objective of this novel electrode modification was to seek new electrochemical performances for the detection of glutathione. The response of catalytic current with glutathione concentration showed a linear relation in the range from 1.0×10?7 to 1.0×10?4 M with a detection limit of 3.0×10?8 M. Finally, this method was used for the determination of glutathione in real samples

The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of administration of fungal mycotoxin (Gliotoxin) on clinical and serobiochemical parameters in camels. A bolus of  0.1(mu)g kg-1  b.wt. of gliotoxin was administered intravenously to camels. The treated camels were lethargic and decreased their appetite from day 3 onwards. The toxin administration decreased the protein and glucose concentration of Serum. The increased activity of aspartate  amino transferase, gamma glutamyl-transferase. sorbitol dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase due to mycotoxin administration was indicative of liver damage. High concentration of urea nitrogen and creatinine in treated. animals was a characteristic of renal injury. In conclusion. the gliotoxin is acutely toxic to camels affccting liver and kidney function.

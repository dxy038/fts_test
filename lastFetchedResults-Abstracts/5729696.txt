As for the control of microgrid, this paper studied multi control strategy of microgrid based on the nonlinear prime dual method. Objective function of the model is minimization of micro sourcesÂ´ cost and cost of purchased power from grid when microgrid is connected to grid while satisfying a series of constraints. Minimization of load shed is the objective function when microgrid is isolated when keeps load as much as possible and ensures the stable of voltage and frequency. Simulation is done with a distributed system. Results indicate that proposed method can ensure the stability of microgrid when it is connected to or isolated from grid.

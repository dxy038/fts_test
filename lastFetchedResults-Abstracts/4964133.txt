The authors use the weighting summation of rapidity, maneuverability and seakeeping as the sub-objective function of ship navigation performances reliability; By using the weighting summation of static and dynamic properties reliability as other sub-objective function, The weighting summation of these 2 sub-objective functions is just the general objective function. In this paper, a parallel multi-processing genetic complex algorithm(PM-C-GA) has been put forward based on genetic algorithm and complex algorithm. This algorithm applied effectively to optimize the mechanics performance reliability of high-speed mono-hull ship.

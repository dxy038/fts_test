Background: Numerical study of angulation effects of renal arteries on blood
?ow has been of great interest for many researchers.
Objective: This paper aims at numerically determining the angulation effects of
stenosed renal arteries on blood ?ow velocity and renal mass ?ow.
Method: An anatomically realistic model of abdominal aorta and renal arteries
is reconstructed from CT-scan images and used to conduct numerical simulation of
pulsatile non-Newtonian blood ?ow incorporating ?uid-structure interaction. The
renal arteries in the realistic model have left and right branch angles of 53° and 45°,
respectively. Atrapezium shape stenosis is considered in the entrance of right renal
artery. Two other branch angles, i.e. 90° and 135°, are also considered for right renal
artery to study the angulation effects.
Results: Comparison between models with right renal branch angles of 45°, 90°
and 135° reveals that high curvature of streamlines in the entrance of the renal artery
with the angle of 135? causes the ?ow velocity and renal mass ?ow to be less than
those of 45?and 90?.
Conclusion: It is concluded that large renal branch angles cause the arteries to
be unable to deliver blood in the requisite amounts to kidney. Kidney responds to
counteract low blood ?ow by activating the renin-angiotension system which leads to
severe hypertension.

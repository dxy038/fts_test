In recent years a number of algorithms were proposed to solve dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems. However, a major problem in the field of dynamic multi-objective optimisation is a lack of standard performance measures to quantify the quality of solutions found by an algorithm. In addition, the selection of performance measures may lead to misleading results. This paper highlights issues that may cause misleading results when comparing dynamic multi-objective optimisation algorithms with performance measures that are currently used in the field.

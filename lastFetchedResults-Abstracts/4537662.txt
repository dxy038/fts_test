Context: This study is directed towards understanding the problems related to the transition phase carried out during the switching of outsourcing vendors in a near-shore context. Objective: Given the scarcity of such studies, an understanding of how the transition of distributed projects is enacted needs to be constructed. This study will contribute such an understanding of the complexity and nature of this key project phase. Method: This study demonstrates the use of secondary data in a longitudinal case study research. The two data analysis techniques used are temporal bracketing and dilemma analysis which enabled us to understand the vendor transition process over time and further come to grips with the various stakeholdersÂ´ views and tensions -- respectively. Results: The results of this study will contribute across substantive, conceptual and methodological domains. Conclusion: In the constructed framework the aim is to identify archetypes and patterns to identify problems before they manifest as major failures.

This paper deals with the approach for assessing the safety critical computer-based railway systems. It presents the method used for planning and conducting an assessment. This paper provides a precise and workable assessment criteria of safety critical digital architecture. It lists the generic measures/techniques used to construct a safe architecture. The objective of this paper is to present the activities related to the assessment of safety digital architectures. It gives a set of criteria used for judging the compliance with the quality and the safety requirements. The criteria are drawn from standards requirements and best practices. These criteria have been applied to assess various case studies used in the European project named ACRuDA (Assessment and Certification Rules for Digital Architecture)

Today, the significant role of culture in directing political, economic, military and social behaviors has caused culture power to be considered an important factor in social interactions and in the persistence and survival of cultures. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps is not an exception to this rule and to persist and survive, it has to preserve its culture over time since this institution established under the order of the great leader of the Revolution and the culture governing it are among the auspicious products of the Islamic Revolution.  Undoubtedly, the very causal factor that led to the rise of this mood and the great changes will also help the persistence and survival of this movement. The present paper is aimed at answering this basic question: What is the nature of culture power and how can the persistence and survival of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards’ culture be guaranteed and the Revolutionary Guards be equipped with a full-fledged defense shield in different arenas? The analysis of the data suggest that this objective can be achieved by directing the cultural elements of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards’ culture correctly and the threats in various areas can be tackled and a comprehensive defense shield can be furnished to defend the Islamic world by making use of the modern technological capabilities and updating the teachings of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards’ culture.

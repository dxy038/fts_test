The main objective of the EU LIFE+ project INTEGREEN is to introduce a demonstrative system for the municipal mobility management centre of the city of Bolzano. The municipality aims at providing the local public authorities with distributed correlated traffic and environmental information for the adoption of eco-friendly real-time traffic management policies. To achieve this goal a new mobile probe with both traffic and environmental monitoring units has been developed. Especially for environmental monitoring no fast and economic measurement devices can be found on the market. Therefore a new platform suitable for automotive use had to be developed. The calibration has been performed by a comparison of the INTEGREEN data with accurate but slower fixed stations. A field measurement campaigns were carried out and the results were presented on different charts and evaluated.

Here we successfully extracted sources from noisy single-channel abdominal phonograms. First, an appropriate matrix of delays was constructed; then multiple independent components were calculated using TDSEP; finally, components were projected back onto the measurement space and grouped using K-means. Three single-channel phonograms from different subjects were analysed. Results showed a better-quality and more objective extraction of Foetal Heart Sounds (S1-S2), maternal activity and line-noise by using this temporal independent approach (versus a FastICA version). Future work will look for extracting more sources and a robust method to measure the quality of the extraction.

The objective of this paper is to analyze the mathematical model of Bessel beamformer with least mean square (LMS) beamforming algorithm using offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) which is one of the efficient digital modulation techniques. The desired user is placed at an angle 20 degree and all other users as interfering signals in a Rayleigh fading scenario. The performance is judged in terms of signal recovery, directive gain, minimum mean square error (MMSE), saving in transmitted power and rate of convergence. The analysis demonstrates that minimization of MSE can be an important technique for the optimization of a weight vector to enhance gain and capacity.

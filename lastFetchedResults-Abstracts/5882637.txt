The objective of this paper is to predict behavior of self excited induction generators (SEIG). A system of parallely operated SEIGs is subjected to various transient conditions such as initial excitation, load perturbation, switching of another machine for parallel operation, and switch-in/out of capacitors in the system. A mathematical model of this system is developed which is based on d-q theory of machine variables and it is represented in the state space form. The developed model is simulated to carry out performance analysis of the system during dynamic conditions. Experimental verification of the simulated results examines the feasibility of the proposed system and validates the mathematical model. The feasibility, of the system is also examined for the purpose of switching one induction generator in parallel to another one with a view to maintain the quality of power supply. The usefulness of the results obtained in this investigation is described

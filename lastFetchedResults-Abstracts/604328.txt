Background: Teaching of anatomy and physiology are the
important basic courses for medical sciences students. If these
courses are taught by animations and films, these will be learnt
better by students. The objective was to determine the of effect of
educational animations in teaching of anatomy and physiology of
organ systems on occupational health students’ learning.
Methods: This study had been performed in planning of
educational course, in cross-sectional study with educational
websites such as Ministry of Health, Medical Sciences Universities
and professors’ opinions. These courses had been taught with
animations in physiology and anatomy for B group and had been
taught without these for A group. Then data had been analyzed in
SPSS 11.5, mean, standard deviation, t-test with P < 0.05.
Results: Mean grade of anatomy in group B was 19.40±0.64 and
in group A was 18.50±0.77 ,with t= -4.102 and P < 0.001 and
mean grade of physiology in B group was 18.41±1.30 and in A
group was 17.99±1.52 ,with t=0.931 and P=0.357.
Conclusions: This teaching was good for learn of anatomy and
some chapters of physiology.

Describes a balancing controller for a 3D multibody model of human walking. The objective is to develop predictive models of human motion. The models are to include reaction to disturbances. This model-based controller forms a model using a recursive formulation of workspace control. The recursive techniques free the control designer from generating the complicated equations of motion. The paper describes first the biped model and then the recursive workspace controller. Simulation results of the human model reacting to a disturbance are presented

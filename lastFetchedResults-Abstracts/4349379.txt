The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant recognized a need for a method of evaluating maintenance personnel. Assessing the proficiency levels of personnel required the establishment of an objective, reliable, time-saving, and valid system to evaluate competency. Concurrently, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) had pioneered a process to develop proficiency assessment tests. A cooperative effort was undertaken. The development of proficiency assessment testing of maintenance personnel was performed in a joint effort between Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric and EPRI.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

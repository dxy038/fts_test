Objective: The bad prognosis of primary carcinoma of the Fallopian tube is ascribed to early lymphogenous metastasis. Due to the rarity of cases, there exist only few and divergent results on the importance of lymph node metastasis in the relevant literature. Thus, our study aimed at detecting the incidence of lymph node metastases and their influence on overall survival, as well as at evaluating the therapeutic effect of radical lymphadenectomy. Methods: We studied 158 cases of primary carcinoma of the Fallopian tube in a retrospective multicenter analysis. Group I (n=38) consisted of patients who were subjected to radical pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in addition to total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adenectomy and omentectomy. The control group II (n=71) underwent the same surgical procedures but without radical lymphadenectomy. Patients who received post-operative irradiation (n=49) were excluded from the study. Results: On average, 38 lymph nodes (range 12–68) were extirpated. In group I 42.1% of the cases showed lymph node metastases. Lymphatic dissemination was observed only after the carcinoma had spread beyond the organ (intraabdominal stage II); the incidence of lymph node metastases rose significantly (P=0.02) with growing intraperitoneal tumour masses. Pelvic and para-aortic metastases occur simultaneously. Overall survival with tumour of equal size is markedly, but not significantly reduced (P=0.18) if the lymph nodes are involved. If, however, radical lymphadenectomy is performed (group I) the median survival time increases to 43 months (95% confidence-interval 20–66), compared with 21 months (95% confidence-interval 10–32) in group II (P=0.095). Conclusion: Correct staging is obtained only on the basis of pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Radical lymphadenectomy in tumours of equal size may markedly prolong survival.

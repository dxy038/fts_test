With the rapid advancement and development in the field of information and communication technologies, it is possible to enable doctors to employ technology in treating the patients. By employing the technology it is easier to treat patients quickly in emergency situations where the life can be saved if adequate medical assistance is provided in time. Based on the concept of telemedicine we have designed and developed a portable telemedicine system which is very compact, user friendly and economical. The portable telemedicine is very useful in the event of life threatening situations like heart attack (Strokes), instant high body temperatures, or abnormal BP conditions etc. Now-a-days there are several telemedicine systems available in the market. However, only a few are useful in the emergency situations. These systems are expensive and bulky and out of reach for most of the common people. The purpose of this paper is to come up with a new idea where these lifesaving telemedicine devices should become affordable for common people by making use of the latest prevailing technologies. In this paper we are going to introduce `Portable Emergency SystemÂ´ which is based on FTC - Find-Treat-Care technique. This system is designed with the integration of various technologies such as GSM/GPRS, GPS, sensors (wearable device) and P2P. The proposed new system will be useful for common people, during the emergency situations to diagnose the mobile heart (Cardiac) patients, diabetic patients, elderly people as well as an accident victim. The prime objective of the proposed new system is to provide urgent provisional medication and shifting of patient to the nearby hospital in time which can save the life of many people before the first contact with an expert doctor.

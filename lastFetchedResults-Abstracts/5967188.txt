In this paper, an objective way to evaluate artistic voice of singing is discussed. The authors take F1 (the first formant), F3 (the third formant), fundamental frequency, vocal range, perturbation of fundamental frequency, perturbation of F1, perturbation of F3 and average energy as the evaluating parameters and assess the quality of singing voices with BPNN (back propagation neural network). The results are then compared with the subjective evaluation of experienced professionals. Experiments show that BP neural network is effective to evaluate the singing voices, thus to be helpful to scientific guidance of selecting and training the talent of artistic voice.

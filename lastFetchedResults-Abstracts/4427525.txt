This paper presents an innovative practice which enhances previous well-tested processes for identifying key assignments and minimum passing criteria to include a rules-based performance vector for embedded course assessment. The modified process provides a common framework for faculty members to follow when justifying their selected key assignments as objective evidence to support meeting course outcomes and student outcomes. The modified framework has resulted in the use of consistent language for justifying key assignments which has proven to eliminate a lot of unnecessary discussion during the evaluation process, in turn streamlining the evaluation process.

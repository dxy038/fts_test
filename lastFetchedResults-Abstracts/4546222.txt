A workshop on environmental engineering education, sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) and the American Academy of Environmental Engineering (AAEE), was held on the Arizona State University campus in Tempe, AZ, January 8-10, 2007. Approximately 60 attendees represented a broad cross-section of environmental engineering education and practice, including faculty and stakeholders from industry, government, and professional organizations. A major objective of the workshop was to explore emerging ldquofrontiersrdquo - innovations, developments, and needs in environmental engineering curriculum and education. Such developments and needs were assessed in the context of how environmental engineering has evolved as a field. Breakout sessions identified trends and needs in environmental curricula and plenary speakers discussed future needs in engineering education, and trends in environmental engineering education. These included sustainability and how systems engineering applies to environmental issues. Different environmental curriculum structures were discussed in the context of a study supported by the Council of Environmental Deans and Directors (CEDD).

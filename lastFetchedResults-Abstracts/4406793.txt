The rapid increase in wind farmsÂ´ penetration level is remarkable. Hence, the investigation of the impact of wind farms on the stability of the system has become more important. In this paper, a new approach for optimal sizing of wind farm with consideration of transient voltage stability and uncertainty of wind speed is presented. For this purpose, PSO algorithm is adopted as search engine for finding the most proper generation capacity of wind farm. In this respect, the operation benefit of wind farms and the transient voltage stability of the system are regarded as two components of the objective function for maximization. Also, in order to consider the uncertainty due to wind speed, the Monte Carlo method has been used to model the uncertainty of the wind speed into planning process. The simulation studies have been performed on the IEEE 39-Bus (New England) system. The simulation results show that when the wind power penetration level increases, the transient security margin reduces but the operation benefit increases.

In this paper, an optimization technique is used for finding the thermal power of heaters over the heater surface on a radiant oven to obtain the desired emissive power and heat flux distributions over the product surface (design surface). The direct problem is solved by a quasi-steady method and the view factors are calculated by the Hotell's crossed string method. The conjugate gradient method is used to minimize the objective function, which is defined by the sum of square residuals between the desired and the estimated heat fluxes over the design surface. The aim of the inverse problem is to optimum the design of thermal systems, such as industrial furnaces, in such a way that the desired transient conditions are achieved over the surface of the product in a thermal process (such as coating, baking and drying).

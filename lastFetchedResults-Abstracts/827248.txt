An precision agriculture is a managerial strategy which examines on special local details for management on product’ s puts on the needed basis of each area, so that economical production increases and the environment sustain the least lost. The final objective of this project is examining on possibility of an precision agricultural technology administering in sari’s rice fields. The final object of this project is evaluating the effective barriers and restrictions factors on applying precision agriculture in sari’s rice fields, from the view of agriculture jihad’s experts. This project is among in correlative-descriptive research and in terms of its applied objective and the type of collecting data, it is a kind of descriptive and non-experimental research and it was done based on measurement. We use chronbach alpha coefficient for determining its reliability. The coefficient of 0.96 percent for all parts of this research shows that research instrument has good reliability. The results showed that there is a significant correlation between barriers and restrictions factors and the possibility of applying the precision agriculture. So the estimation equation show’s that our research’s independent variable establishes 41 percent of our research’s dependent variable.

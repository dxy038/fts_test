This paper deals with temperature control of the Copper Isasmelt plant at Mount Isa Mine. Improved temperature control is associated with substantial monetary returns primarily due to the extension of refractory brick life through the reduction of excessive temperatures. An advanced control project was undertaken with the objective of improving control performance and reducing operator intervention. This work first involved an extensive dynamic modelling exercise which consisted of a combination of simplified first-principles modelling in conjunction with black-box techniques. Based on these models a number of control strategies were designed and simulated and, in turn, implemented in prototype form on the real plant. A number of plant trials over a period of several months were undertaken and results are favourable.

In this study, a novel procedure is presented for control and analysis of multiple autonomous agents with point mass dynamics achieving flocking motion using fuzzy logic. Two cooperative control laws are proposed for a group of autonomous agents to achieve flocking formations related to two different centers (mass center and geometric center) of the flock. The first one is designed for flocking motion guided at mass center and the other for geometric center. A virtual agent is introduced to represent a group objective for tracking purposes. Smooth graph Laplacian and smooth fuzzy control component are introduced to overcome the difficulties in theoretical analysis. The theoretical results are presented to indicate the stability (cohesiveness, collision avoidance and velocity matching) of the control systems. Finally, simulation example is demonstrated to validate the theoretical results.

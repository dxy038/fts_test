The objective of this paper is to investigate a methodology, which can extract approximate results for the free space radiation pattern from data obtained in a non-anechoic environment. Using an impulse response in the angular domain at a single frequency of the non-anechoic environment, the free space pattern of the device under test is estimated. Simulated data has been used to illustrate the applicability of this new methodology.

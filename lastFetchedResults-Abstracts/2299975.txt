Diabetes was one of the most important metabolic and public health diseases all over the world. It was the most common endocrine disease caused by metabolic disorders. Type 2 diabetes is rapidly progressing in world. The incidence of diabetes is predicted to double in the following 20 years. The current study was aims to evaluate the effect of standard nutrition and exercise on glucose and lipid levels in diabetic patients. It was an intervention study whose target population is consisting of 120 diabetic patients who had referred to PARSIAN Diabetes Research Center. Sampling size has been non-randomly selected. Mean and standard deviation are quantitative data applied in this study. T-test and independent sample T-test have been respectively utilized to compare changes within and between the groups. The amount of p-value has been calculated less than 0.05 which indicates statistical significance. The achieved findings shows that glucose level has significantly decreased in experiment group using a pretest-posttest design (P &lt; 0.05). Eight-week standard nutrition and regular exercise have significant effect on decrease of glucose level, insulin resistance and plasma lipoproteins. It is suggested to apply these programs in diabetes centers.

In the scope of the reregulation process of the electric sector, both competitive pool markets and contract mechanisms at the generation and commercialization levels have been emerging. At the wholesale level, and apart from pool structures and bilateral contracts, there are hybrid models in which these two types of structures coexist. In any case, the dispatch coming from the pool market operator, prepared according to the buying and selling offers, together with the bilateral contracted powers must be analyzed from a technical point of view by an independent entity-the system operator. The system operator aims at checking if the scheduled injected powers do not lead to a decrease of the security standards of the system. Taking into account this concern, in this paper we describe several models to perform the technical validation of sets of electricity schedules, namely trying to minimize the financial impact of the required changes on pre-scheduled generations and loads. This objective is modelled in terms of maximizing the satisfaction degree felt by the participants in the market. The developed application uses simulated annealing to solve the corresponding optimization problems. In this paper we include results obtained from several simulations in order to illustrate and demonstrate the interest of the referred models

In this paper, we propose the electroencephalography (EEG) feature extraction method of the change in riding comfort according to the difference of the tire. It is a proposal of the objective evaluation technique. The feature of the EEG during the driving is extracted by the factor analysis. Moreover, the correlation between the subjective evaluation and the detected features of EEG is calculated. Then, the effectiveness of the proposed method as a objective evaluation technique was shown from the result.

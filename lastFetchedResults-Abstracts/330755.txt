Objective. The objective of the present study is to evaluate and compare the flexural strength, dynamic elastic moduli and true hardness (Ho) values of commercial Vita In-Ceram® alumina core and Vita In-Ceram® matrix glass with the standard aluminous porcelain (Hi-Ceram® and Vitadur®), Vitadur N® and Dicor® glass and glass-ceramic.

Methods. The flexural strength was evaluated (n=5) using 3-point loading and a servo hydraulic Instron testing machine at a cross head speed of 0.5 mm/min. The density of the specimens (n=3) was measured by means of the water displacement technique. Dynamic Young's shear and bulk moduli and Poisson's ratio (n=3) were measured using a non-destructive ultrasonic technique using 10 MHz lithium niobate crystals. The true hardness (n=3) was measured using a Knoop indenter and the fracture toughness (n=3) was determined using a Vickers indenter and a Tukon hardness tester. Statistical analysis of the data was conducted using ANOVA and a Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK) rank order multiple comparative test.

Results. The SNK rank order test analysis of the mean flexural strength was able to separate five commercial core materials into three significant groups at p=0.05. Vita In-Ceram® alumina and IPS Empress® 2 exhibited significantly higher flexural strength than aluminous porcelains and IPS Empress® at p=0.05. The dynamic elastic moduli and true hardness of Vita In-Ceram® alumina core were significantly higher than the rest of the commercial ceramic core materials at p=0.05.

Significance. The ultrasonic test method is a valuable mechanical characterization tool and was able to statistically discriminate between the chemical and structural differences within dental ceramic materials. Significant correlation was obtained between the dynamic Young's modulus and true hardness, p=0.05.

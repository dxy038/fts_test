In this paper, a topology optimization approach is used for the design of an electrostatic actuator that can be manufactured using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology. The design goal is to obtain constant maximum torque by properly distributing dielectric material in the rotor design space. The objective function is defined for the difference of the system energy to be maximized with respect to the rotation of the rotor. The detailed design with unique rotor pole shape is achieved. Also, the effects of mesh size and initial conditions on final rotor shape are discussed

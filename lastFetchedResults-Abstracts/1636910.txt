Purine nucleoside phosphorylase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtPNP) is numbered among targets for persistence of the causative agent of tuberculosis. Here, it is shown that MtPNP is more specific to natural 6-oxopurine nucleosides and synthetic compounds, and does not catalyze the phosphorolysis of adenosine. Initial velocity, product inhibition and equilibrium binding data suggest that MtPNP catalyzes 2â€²-deoxyguanosine (2dGuo) phosphorolysis by a steady-state ordered bi bi kinetic mechanism, in which inorganic phosphate (Pi) binds first followed by 2dGuo, and ribose 1-phosphate dissociates first followed by guanine. pH-rate profiles indicated a general acid as being essential for both catalysis and 2dGuo binding, and that deprotonation of a group abolishes Pi binding. Proton inventory and solvent deuterium isotope effects indicate that a single solvent proton transfer makes a modest contribution to the rate-limiting step. Pre-steady-state kinetic data indicate that product release appears to contribute to the rate-limiting step for MtPNP-catalyzed reaction.

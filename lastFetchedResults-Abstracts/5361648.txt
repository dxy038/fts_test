This paper describes a general framework for global evaluation and ranking alternatives within the metal cutting process planning. Two methods are used: suitability measure generation and application of fuzzy integrals, specifically Choquet integral. These two methods can be applied for each process planning stage, which require alternatives evaluation and ranking and are built in an additional module for computer aided process planning expert system (CAPP ES). With two other upgrading modules for dealing with fuzzy data and information operation, such expert system enables the generation of solutions using both objective (technical) criteria and constraints, and subjective belief based on experience and/or recently presented evidence, expressed linguistically. Procedure of global evaluation and ranking of alternatives, as well as operation of additional CAPP ES modules is illustrated by an example

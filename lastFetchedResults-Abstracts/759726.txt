Prior studies have indicated that the relationship
between parent-child conflict and adolescent antisocial
behavior is at least partially shared environmental in origin.
However, all available research on this topic (to our
knowledge) relies exclusively on parent and/or adolescent
informant-reports, both of which are subject to various
forms of rater bias. As the presence of significant shared
environmental effects has often been attributed to rater bias
in the past (Baker et al. Journal of Abnormal Psychology
16:219–235, 2007; Bartels et al. Journal of the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 42:1351–
1359, 2003, Twin Research 7:162–175, 2004; Hewitt et al.
Behavior Genetics 22:293–317, 1992), it would be important
to confirm that findings of shared environmental
mediation persist when even examining (presumably more
objective) observer-ratings of these constructs. The current
study thus examined the origins of the relationship between
parent-child conflict and adolescent acting-out behavior, as
measured using both observer-ratings and various
informant-reports. Participants included 1,199 adopted and
non-adopted adolescents in 610 families from the Sibling
Interaction and Behavior Study (SIBS). Results indicated
that parent-child conflict consistently predicts acting-out
behavior in adopted adolescents, and moreover, that this
association is equivalent to that in biologically-related
adolescents. Most importantly, these findings did not vary
across parent- and adolescent-reported or observer-ratings
of parent-child conflict and acting-out behavior. Such
findings argue strongly against rater bias as a primary
explanation of shared environmental mediation of the
association between parent-child conflict and adolescent
antisocial behavior

This paper presents a new integrated set of tools for obtaining both objective and subjective evaluations of car audio systems using a single session of recording with a mannequin in the cockpit. The system should be an important aid for the design of more effective car audio systems, especially loudspeaker subsystems. A fully automated stimulation, acquisition and identification procedure together with a fully integrated database, simulation and listening procedure has been developed. The simulator is able to compare in real time different audio systems, change seat and select a head pan and tilt within a limited number of positions. Visual cues make the listening experience more effective: a real car cockpit is shown during the listening with the listener virtually seated on each of the possible positions.

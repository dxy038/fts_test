A parallel algorithm of simulated annealing to solve the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is considered. The VRPTW is an NP-hard bicriterion optimization problem in which both the number of vehicles and the total distance traveled by vehicles are minimized. The objective is to establish to what extent the computation time required to solve the VRPTW can be decreased by a number of co-operating parallel processes with no loss of quality of solutions. The quality of a solution is meant as its proximity to the optimum (or best known) solution. Furthermore, some factors are proposed which allow to rank the VRPTW benchmarking tests according to their difficulties

The growing appreciation of the pathophysiological and prognostic importance of arterial morphology have led to the realization that angiograms are inherently limited in defining the distribution and extension of coronary wall disease. By IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS) physicians have a picture of the composition of vessel in detail. However, observing an IVUS pullback it is difficult to figure out the catheter position with regard to the vessel parts and ramifications, and misclassfication of lesions is possible. The objective of this work is to develop a computer vision technique to fuse the information from IVUS and angiograms defining the correspondence of every IVUS image with a corresponding point of the vessel in the angiograms

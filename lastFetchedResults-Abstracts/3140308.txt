Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) has been applied to calculate many optimization problems in electrical system. But it is very difficult to use MOEA to handle dynamic reactive power optimization due to its high computing complexity. An adaptive &#949; domination technology was applied to facilitate calculate dynamic reactive power optimization in this paper. The method includes 2 stages to complete the calculation: 1st one is to get initial solutions for the 1st hour condition of a day, the 2nd one is to handle the succedent 23 hours conditions as a whole. The approach has been verified by the numerical simulation on IEEE 30 bus test system.

In this paper, we present an efficient image interpolation scheme by using regularized local linear regression (RLLR). On one hand, we introduce a robust estimator of local image structure based on moving least squares, which can efficiently handle the statistical outliers compared with ordinary least squares based methods. On the other hand, motivated by recent progress on manifold based semi-supervise learning, the intrinsic manifold structure is explicitly considered by making use of both measured and unmeasured data points. In particular, the geometric structure of the marginal probability distribution induced by unmeasured samples is incorporated as an additional locality preserving constraint. The optimal model parameters can be obtained with a closed-form solution by solving a convex optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperform the existing methods in both objective and subjective visual quality over a wide range of test images.

In this paper, a new day-ahead scheduling method for microgrid islanding is presented. The objective of the scheduling is to minimize the local battery charge/discharge activities and maximize the continuous islanding time based on the given resource generation and load forecast information. To simplify the solving complexity, the problem is decomposed into two modules. The power balance module focuses on satisfying the required islanding conditions by dispatching the available battery storage devices. The feasibility of the proposed battery charge/discharge schedules is verified by the security check module via a complete AC power flow. If any branch flow or bus voltage violations are detected, corresponding security constraints will be generated and added to the original power balance model. The battery charge/discharge schedules will be adjusted to eliminate the security violations. The iteration between the power balance and security check modules will continue until all violated constraints are resolved or the maximum iteration number is reached. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been proven through the test case.

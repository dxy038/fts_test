System-level design is characterized by a behavioral specification and heterogeneous hardware/software implementations. Exploring the design space is essential for good design. Specifying and managing complex design flows, tracking dependencies and tool invocations, and maintaining consistency of design data and flows are key issues that enable efficient design space exploration. In order to manage the complexity of this design process, an infrastructure that manages these issues, transparent to the user, is presented. These concepts have been implemented in the Ptolemy environment within a framework called DesignMaker. An example design flow for multiprocessor synthesis is presented in some detail to illustrate the features of DesignMaker. The end objective of the framework is to facilitate a flexible system-level codesign assistant

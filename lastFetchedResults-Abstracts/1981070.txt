Solid-state bioprocessing of soybean by Monascus is a biotechnological strategy to produce Monascus-fermented soybeans (MFS) with more beneficial components. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant properties of cold and hot water extracts from MFS as compared to uninoculated soybeans. With regard to the EC50 values of antioxidant activities, the effectiveness of cold water extracts was in a descending order: soybeans &gt; MFS-31527 &gt; MFS-31499 whereas that of the hot water extracts: soybeans âˆ¼ MFS-31499 &gt; MFS31527. Cold water extracts showed higher reducing power and lower scavenging ability on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals than hot water extracts. For both extracts, MFS and soybeans showed comparable effective chelating abilities on ferrous ions. Total phenols were the major naturally occurring antioxidant components found. For both extracts, soybeans were more effective in antioxidant activity and scavenging ability on DPPH radicals whereas MFS-31499 and MFS-31527 were more effective in reducing power and scavenging ability on hydroxyl radicals. Based on the results obtained, MFS-31499, MFS-31527 and soybeans were relatively effective in the antioxidant properties assayed and might be potential antioxidants for application in food products.

The objective of the current study is to survey the relationship between psychological hardiness and self-toleration, and vocational weariness among the personnel of Ardabil prisons. The survey population includes 100 of the personnel of Ardabil prisons that were selected by simple random sampling. The following tools were used for data collection: Kobasa's psychological hardiness questionnaire, toleration questionnaire of Conover and Davidson and Meslash's vocational weariness. The results of Pearson correlation coefficient showed that there is a direct relationship between toleration and psychological hardiness (r=0.409). There is a significant inverse relationship between toleration and emotional analysis (r=-0.386). There is also a significant inverse relationship between toleration and personality metamorphosis (r=-0.379). There is a significant inverse relationship between hardiness and emotional analysis (r=-0.344). There is a significant inverse relationship between hardiness and personality metamorphosis (r=-0.438). There isn't a significant relationship between toleration and hardiness, and lack of personal successfulness (r=0.083). The results of multivariate regression analysis showed that toleration and hardiness have a significant role in the prediction of vocational weariness of the personnel of Ardabil prisons. It means that toleration and hardiness predict the vocational weariness of the prison personnel.

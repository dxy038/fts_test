Describes an intelligent control system architecture for the control of patient-ventilator synchrony. The long-term objective of the research is to develop an innovative intelligent system for controlling the process of mechanical ventilatory support for patients undergoing therapy in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). The initial work focuses on the requirements for a medical-advisory/decision-support system. The hierarchical structure of the system is organized around three main processing levels, a sensing/perception level, a planning/coordination level, and a supervision/control level. Using measured data from the patient, heuristics gleaned from experienced clinicians, and intelligent planning and control principles, the overall system is expected to provide significant improvements in the quality of care given to patients needing such therapy.

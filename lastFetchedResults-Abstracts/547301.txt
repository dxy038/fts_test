People were asked about different methods of public information and education, as well as the types of information needed for earthquake preparedness.
Results: The important issues indicated by respondents were supervision on building construction and strengthening of buildings as well as public education. The educational tools and media that were proposed by the respondents included television, radio, posters, educational classes, newspapers and instructional pamphlets regarding earthquakes, video films and internet, respectively. The study has also shown that with the assumption of earthquake occurrence in Tehran, the most important sources for getting immediate information were the general public and TV. 70% of the respondents believed that in case of earthquake prediction, people should be informed by the media.

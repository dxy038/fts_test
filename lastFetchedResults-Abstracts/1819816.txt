Objective
ontitis is a well-appreciated example of leukocyte-mediated bone loss and inflammation with pathogenic features similar to those observed in other inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis. Since Tacrolimus, is an immunomodulatory drug used for the treatment of some cases of arthritis, we hypothesized that it may modulate periodontal disease.

a murine model of ligature-induced periodontal disease, we assessed the effects of daily administrations of Tacrolimus (1 mg/kg body weight) on bone loss, enzymatic (myeloperoxidase) analysis, differential white blood cells counts, airpouch exudate and cytokine expression for 5–30 days.
s
raphic, enzymatic (myeloperoxidase) and histological analysis revealed that Tacrolimus reduced the severity of periodontitis. More specifically, Tacrolimus suppressed the expression of serum interleukin (IL-1β), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), IL-6, airpouch exudate PGE2 and leukocytosis usually observed after the induction of periodontitis. Tacrolimus treatment in periodontitis-induced rats conferred protection against the inflammation-induced tissue and bone loss associated with periodontitis, through a mechanism involving IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6.
sions
fects of Tacrolimus on periodontal disease pathogenesis may provide clues to a novel approach to host modulation therapy in destructive periodontal disease.

Linear electrical motors (LMs) are increasingly used in industry applications to develop linear motion. However, they suffer from two major drawbacks i.e. low efficiency and low power factor which cause more energy consumption, a rise in input current and occupation of transmission lines capacity. This paper presents a multi objective optimization method to improve both efficiency and power factor, simultaneously. For this purpose, the analytical model of machine is employed to calculate the efficiency and power factor. Motor parameters and dimensions are then optimized using genetic algorithm and an appropriate objective function. The results show an enhancement in motor performance. Finally, time stepping finite element method is used to evaluate the analytical results. The comparison of results validates the method.

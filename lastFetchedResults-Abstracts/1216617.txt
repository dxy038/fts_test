An optimization solution to roll shifting strategy for alternately rolling campaign is presented. All the strips in a rolling campaign are divided into narrow strips and wide ones, and shifting position of narrow strips is obtained by the recursive method, and then shifting position of wide strips is optimized by NSGA-II which is a multi-objective genetic algorithm. For wide strips, a multi-objective optimization model of roll shifting strategy is proposed, which takes 3 wear contour factors including edge smoothness, body smoothness and edge drop as optimization objectives. The Pareto optimal front of roll shifting strategy can be gained quickly by NSGA-II, which suggests a series of alternative solutions to roll shifting strategy. Analysis shows that the conflict exists among the 3 objectives. The final optimal solution is selected from the Pareto optimal solutions by the weighted-sum decision-making method. Industrial production proves the validity of the solution, and it can improve strip profile of alternately rolling, reduce strip edge wave, and extend the rolling miles of rolling campaigns.

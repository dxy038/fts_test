The integration of biological and chemical controls is a common objective of integrated pest management (IPM). It was found that pirimiphos-methyl, thiamethoxam, malathion and thiacloprid are highly toxic to the parasitoid and they have to be used in such a way to prevent their harmful effects on the parasitoid. On the other hand, cypermethrin and pirimicarb showed a ratio of toxicity of less than one, this means that they are more toxic to the cabbage aphid than to its parasitoid. Cypermethrin and pirimicarb are good candidates to be used in IPM programs for the cabbage aphid

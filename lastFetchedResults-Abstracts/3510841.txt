Electric demand-side management is the concept of altering the pattern of the customer\Â´s electricity use "behind-the-meter." The scope of demand-side management is the planning, development and implementation of programs whose objective is to actively shape the daily and seasonal electric load profiles of customers to result in better overall system utilization, lower overall costs and maintained financial stability. This paper describes the integration of demand-side management into the utility planning process and is based on a panel held at the 1985 Winter Power Meeting.

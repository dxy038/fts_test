There is a long history of interest in developmental theory
and research in the processes by which function in one domain
or level or system influences another system or level
of function over time to shape the course of ontogenesis
and epigenesis. Theoretically, these effects reflect the processes
(transactions; coactions) by which interactions influence
development in complex living systems (Ford & Lerner,
1992; Gottlieb, 1998, 2007; Sameroff, 2000; Thelen &
Smith, 1998; Ward, 1995). Developmental cascades refer to
the cumulative consequences for development of the many
interactions and transactions occurring in developing systems
that result in spreading effects across levels, among domains
at the same level, and across different systems or generations.
Theoretically these effects may be direct and unidirectional,
direct and bidirectional, or indirect through various pathways,
but the consequences are not transient: developmental
cascades alter the course of development. Such effects have
gone by different names in the literature, including chain reactions,
and snowball, amplification, spillover or progressive
effects, as well as developmental cascades (Burt et al., 2008;
Cicchetti & Cannon, 1999; Cicchetti & Tucker, 1994; Dodge
et al., 2009; Dodge & Pettit, 2003; Fry & Hale, 1996; Hanson
& Gottesman, 2007; Hinshaw, 1992; Hinshaw & Anderson,
1996; Kagan, 2005; Masten & Coatsworth, 1998; Masten
et al., 2005; Patterson, Reid, & Dishion, 1992; Rutter, 1999;
Rutter, Kim-Cohen, & Maughan, 2006; Rutter & Sroufe,
2000).

N-nitrosamines are potential carcinogens that are formed during disinfection by chlorination/chloramination or ozonation. In this study, the main objective was to optimize ozonation experimental conditions (pH and temperature) for the production of N-nitrosamines by using the CCD method in wastewater matrices. As the results, maximum NDMA FPO3 (formation potential by ozonation) occurred at pH 8.96 and a temperature of 20.0 Â°C. Furthermore, attempts to reduce the concentrations of eight N-nitrosamines revealed that none was removed or reduced in concentration by ozonation using Milli-Q water for 2 h.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of various mineral admixtures in producing self-compacting concrete (SCC). For this purpose, fly ash (FA), granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), limestone powder (LP), basalt powder (BP) and marble powder (MP) were used. Workability of SCC was determined using slump flow, T50 time, L-box and V-funnel tests. The hardened properties that were determined included ultrasonic pulse velocity and compressive strength determined at 7 and 28 days. It was concluded that among the mineral admixtures used, FA and GBSF significantly increased the workability of SCC. Durability properties of SCC mixtures such as, chloride ion permeability and water impermeability have been investigated besides mechanical properties within the scope this study. Test results indicated that SCC could be obtained with not only LP which the most common filler material in SCC applications but also BP and MP as filler materials. Replacing 20% of Portland cement (PC) with GBFS resulted in strength of more than 78 MPa at 28 days. Furthermore, the best resistance to chloride ion permeability was obtained from a combination of 60% GBFS with 40% PC. On the other hand, impermeability depth test results were in the range of 4.42â€“12.58 mm.

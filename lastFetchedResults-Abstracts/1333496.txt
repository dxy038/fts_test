The objective of this investigation is to study the complex vibration characteristics of an actual spacecraft structure using the FEA code in conjunction with experimental data. The body of a satellite consists of a monocoque structure formed by joining several composite sandwich panels composed of an aluminum honeycomb core with carbon fiber reinforced laminate skins on both sides.

An extensive random vibration test campaign was conducted on the satellite structure using an electro-dynamic shaker, and its results were compared with the FEA values. After this campaign, a database was established which correlates computational analysis modeling schemes with random acceleration spectra responses on selected locations obtained from the tests. These results can be successfully applied as reference data when a new satellite is developed and can provide excellent criteria in the vibration-proof design and analysis of a satellite. This paper demonstrates a modeling technique and discusses the applications of numerical analysis theories. It also gives the results achieved from the advanced vibration tests.

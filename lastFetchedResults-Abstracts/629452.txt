In this work, potable water samples collected from boreholes of the Migdonia valley, located NE of the city of Thessaloniki, were analyzed for the determination of uranium (238U) and radon (222Rn) concentrations. The objective of the present work is to examine if there is any correlation between radon and uranium concentrations in the water samples.
For the determination of traces of uranium in water samples, an analytical technique was developed based on the selective adsorption of uranium on the chelating resin, SRAFION NMRR, and the in situ determination of the retained uranium by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). By the described procedure, it was possible to determine uranium amounts in the range of μg/l. For measuring radon in water, a liquid scintillation counting system, using the Packard protocol was employed. The measured 222Rn activity concentrations are from background level up to 160 Bq l−1.

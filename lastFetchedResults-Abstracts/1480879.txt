To fully characterize properties of the muscles of the beef chuck and round, and to reveal potential opportunities to upgrade the value, 39 different muscles were dissected from 142 beef carcasses differing in carcass weight, yield grade, and quality grade. Numerous physical and chemical properties of the muscles were determined. Muscle effects were observed for all traits (objective color, expressible moisture, proximate composition, emulsion capacity, pH, total collagen content, total heme-iron concentration, and Warnerâ€“Bratzler shear force). USDA quality grade generally had the most effect on muscle traits, with carcass weight and yield grade having lesser effects. These muscle profile data will allow for more informed decisions to be made in the selection of individual muscles from the beef chuck and round for the production of value-added products.

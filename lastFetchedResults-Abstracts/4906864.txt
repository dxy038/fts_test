Interoperability between management systems is significantly altered by an overload of data, along with syntactic and semantic dissonance of management information. New service-oriented architectures have been proposed to facilitate the decentralization of the control and to add more flexibility in the management process. However, a little was done towards the reuse of legacy information in nowadays modeling framework. In this paper, we demonstrate how existing information definition can be reused and integrated using semantic Web technologies. Our objective is to enhance SNMP and WBEM solutions with semantic Web services technologies, thus, allowing interoperability between heterogeneous systems and truly facilitating the design, the deployment and the maintenance of network management systems.

The seamless integration of renewable distributed generation (DG) units into distribution system has become one of the most challenging research aspects in the recent years. The systematic deployment of renewable DG units can improve distribution system performance in terms of voltage support, loss minimisation, emission reduction, and reliability improvement. It is important to consider technical and economic incentives with the integration of renewable DG units. In this paper, a multi-objective distribution system expansion planning model with integration of renewable DG units is presented. It proposes comprehensive approach to address multiple conflicting objectives without loosing generality. A problem-specific particle swarm optimisation (PSO) based search method is used to solve the formulated planning problem. Scenario based studies are performed to examine the impacts of different DG allocations on system reliability and the investment cost of system reinforcement.

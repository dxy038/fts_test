The problem of the fixed-spectrum frequency assignment, where the objective is to minimize the cost due to the interference arising in a solution, is studied and solved in this paper using a discrete particle swarm optimization which is refined by a deterministic local search heuristic. Computational results, obtained for eight well-known benchmarks problem, confirm the effectiveness of discrete particle swarm optimization.

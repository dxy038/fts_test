<para> A monitoring cycle (m-cycle) is a preconfigured optical loop-back connection of supervisory wavelengths with a dedicated monitor. In an all-optical network (AON), if a link fails, the supervisory optical signals in a set of m-cycles covering this link will be disrupted. The link failure can be localized using the alarm code generated by the corresponding monitors. In this paper, we first formulate an optimal integer linear program (ILP) for m-cycle design. The objective is to minimize the monitoring cost which consists of the monitor cost and the bandwidth cost (i.e., supervisory wavelength-links). To reduce the ILP running time, a heuristic ILP is also formulated. To the best of our survey, this is the first effort in m-cycle design using ILP, and it leads to two contributions: 1) nonsimple m-cycles are considered; and 2) an efficient tradeoff is allowed between the monitor cost and the bandwidth cost. Numerical results show that our ILP-based approach outperforms the existing m-cycle design algorithms with a significant performance gain. </para>

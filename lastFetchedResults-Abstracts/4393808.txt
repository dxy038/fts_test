The limited capacity of batteries of nodes imposes a constraint on ad hoc networks. Thus, energy efficiency is critical to prolong the network lifetime. Network traffic should be routed such that the energy consumption is minimized. In this paper, we discuss the energy-efficient multicast problem in ad hoc networks with the respect of delay. Multicast routing deals with finding a multicast tree, which is rooted from the source and addresses all destination nodes. The energy cost of all the nodes that transmit multicast messages in Ad hoc network should be minimized. Our objective is to construct a network topology that minimizes the total energy cost of the multicast tree and meets delay requirements. We formulate the problem as a Constraint Optimization Model for the Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (COMANET) problem along with delay constraint.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the properties of chitosan–gelatin membranes or scaffolds, which were modified by incorporation of hyaluronic acid in the surface or bulk phase through co-crosslinking with N,N-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)-N′-ethyl carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) in 2-morpholinoethane sulfonic acid (MES) buffer. The comparative study on properties of surface modification (HA(S)) and polyblend membranes (HA(C)) revealed that gelatin was enriched on the surface of HA(C), while hyaluronic acid was enriched on the surface of the HA(S). The HA(S) membranes made by surface modification method had a characteristic surface morphology. The corresponding scaffolds were prepared through freeze-drying. The incorporation of hyaluronic acid improved flexibility and fibroblasts adhesion, while slowing down the rate of biodegradation of chitosan–gelatin scaffold. Human fibroblasts adhered and proliferated well on the membranes or scaffolds in vitro.

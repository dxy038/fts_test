Currently, the satisfaction of user is becoming one of the most important topics. With the development of wireless networks and mobile computing, more advanced multimedia applications with QoE-awareness are needed. In this paper, web middleware architecture for the development of QoE-aware multimedia applications on a mobile device is presented. A QoS/QoE correlation model for multimedia service is proposed, and the QoE evaluation method using QoS parameter in wireless network environment is studied. Using the proposed QoS/QoE correlation model, applications based on our web middleware can predict the objective QoE value of multimedia service in offered network environment and adjust application parameters to improve QoE.

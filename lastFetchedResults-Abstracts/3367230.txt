A comprehensive theoretical analysis of a distributed erbium doped fibre amplifier has been carried out, using a highly accurate model. Designs based on bidirectional pumping schemes are evaluated. Optimum step index profile designs are given based on the tradeoff between dispersion and non-linearities of the optical fibre.

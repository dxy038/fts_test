In this paper a bidirectional switched boost converter is proposed. Conventional Z-source converter (ZSC) requires two inductors and two capacitors of equal inductance and capacitance which is difficult to realize in practice. Switched boost converter (SBC) is an improved derivative of ZSC comprising of one inductor and one capacitor which overcomes the stability issues associated with it. But power flow is limited to one direction in case of SBC. In AC-DC hybrid micro grid and in some energy storage applications bidirectional power flow is the most essential requirement. Proposed bidirectional switched boost converter (BSBC) retains the advantage of SBC and provides additional advantage of bidirectional power flow which makes it more suitable for AC-DC hybrid micro grid. Unaltered voltage gain is achieved at the AC bus and DC bus in both the directions of power flow. The Matlab simulation results are shown to verify the operation and theoretical analysis of proposed BSBC converter.

The objective is to locate undesirable facilities on a network so as to minimize the total demand covered subject to the condition that no two facilities are allowed to be closer than a pre-specified distance. We prove that there exists a dominating location set and that it is a challenging problem to determine the consistency of the distance constraints. We compare several different mathematical formulations to solve the problem. Heuristics with computational experiments are provided.

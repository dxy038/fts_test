Background:
 Tubercle bacilli most often are transmitted from one person by the airborne route. The aim of the present
study was to determine the frequency of latent tuberculosis infection and active pulmonary tuberculosis among patients
with chronic psychiatric disorders in Hamedan.
Patients and methods: 
In a cross sectional study, 215 patients with chronic psychiatric disorders were investigated for
tuberculin skin test. Those with an induration of ?10 mm were introduced for further evaluation, including a chest x-ray and examination of the sputum for acid-fast bacilli for those with radiographic abnormalities.
Results:
 Of 215 patients, 62 (28.8%) had positive tuberculin skin test reaction. Age and duration of psychiatric disorders
were significantly associated with test positivity. Of 62 tuberculin-positive patients, 25 (40.3%) had radiographic
evidences of inactive pulmonary tuberculosis. None of them had positive sputum smear for tuberculosis.
Conclusion: 
Chronic psychiatric patients are more susceptible to tuberculosis infection. Screening tests should be
applied for these patients.

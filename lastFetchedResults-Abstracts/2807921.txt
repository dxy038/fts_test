This manuscript has the objective to perform an experimental comparative analysis of the total ionizing dose influence in the Silicon-On-Insulator Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor implemented with the octagonal gate shape (OCTO) and the standard one (rectangular gate shape) counterpart, after a X-ray radiation exposure. The back-gate bias technique is applied in these devices to reestablish the threshold voltage and subthreshold slope that were degraded by the ionizing radiation effects. Since the octagonal layout style maintains a better electrical performance after radiation, a smaller back-gate bias to recover the pre-rad operation is required in comparison to the conventional counterpart. This is mainly because the parasitic transistors in the birdÂ´s beak region are practically deactivated by the particular octagonal gate geometry.

This paper presents a new approach that improves the performance of the Newton´s method for optimal reactive dispatch problem. In this approach the inequality constraints are divided into two groups: constraints treated by penalty function, which are added to the objective function through penalty factors, and constraints treated by barrier function that are grouped with the set of active constraints (power flow equations). The first order necessary conditions for optimality are reached by Newton´s method, and by updating the penalty and barrier terms. The factorization is carried out on elements instead of structures in blocks. The main advantage is not to identify the biding constraints set. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been examined by solving the 53-bus and 118-bus systems.

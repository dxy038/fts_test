The objective of this study is to conduct two different teaching methods, expository method and Peer´s instruction method, on two sessions and to assess the effectiveness of two teaching methods, and also to compare the physics background of the ROC naval cadets with those of USA college students. Preliminarily we find the Peer instruction method is a better way to improve the physics concepts. ROC cadets are on the verge of understanding physics. Also the strict limitation imposed by the military environment on the cadet´s life plays a critical role in our teaching strategy

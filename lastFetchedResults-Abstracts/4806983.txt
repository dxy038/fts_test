Lecturing a discrete event simulation course implies some challenges for the instructors. These challenges implies taking decisions from the design of the course to the selection of the didactic strategy to be used in each lecture. On the other hand, the use of games during a lecture make easier the understanding of simulation concepts. Moreover, games may be designed to show the impact of changing the value of the decision variables, similar to a decision support system software. This paper presents a methodology to design an interactive simulation game, useful to teach discrete event simulation for undergraduate courses. The main objective of the game is to create an environment to make easier the students&#194;&#191; understanding about simulation, such that they may learn the benefits of using simulation as modeling and analysis tool, and they may receive training on decision making concepts.

This paper presents a method for optimal allocation of distributed generation in distribution systems. In this paper, our aim would be optimal distributed generation allocation for loss reduction in distribution network. Ant colony search algorithm (ACSA) was used as solving tool. ACSA is inspired from the natural behaviour of the ant colonies on how they find the food source and bring them back to their nest by building the unique trail formation. This algorithm is used to minimize an objective function. For applying ACSA, a soft ware is programmed under Matlab software is prepared. This proposed ACSA method and genetic algorithm (GA) are implemented on IEEE 34 bus system, and the results show that the proposed method is better than the other two methods. Using the proper and optimal allocation of DG has many advantages, but the lack of it has disadvantages, such as: increasing losses, voltage flicker, and harmonic.

In this paper, we address present an optimal solution for the problem of multimedia object placement for hybrid transparent data replication. The performance objective is to minimize the total access cost by considering both transmission cost and transcoding cost. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated with a set of carefully designed simulation experiments for various performance metrics over a wide range of system parameters. The simulation results show that our solution consistently and significantly outperforms comparison solutions in terms of all the performance metrics considered

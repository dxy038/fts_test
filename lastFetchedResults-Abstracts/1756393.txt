Objective
sion is a major problem in patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with negative impact on survival and quality of life. No studies have examined prevention of post-ACS depression. We examined whether treatment with escitalopram can prevent post-ACS depression.
s
e conducted a randomised controlled trial. Between November 2004 and December 2007, 240 patients in 2 university hospitals in Copenhagen, Denmark, with ACS were randomised. Patients were randomised to a double-blind treatment with escitalopram or matching placebo for 1 year. Main outcome measure was the incidence of ICD-10 depressive episode.
s
 patients treated with escitalopram 2 developed depression versus 10 in placebo treated group (log rank, p= 0.022). In multivariate analysis treatment with placebo and high Hamilton Depression Scale score at baseline were associated with development of depression. Patients were well matched at baseline.
sion
 months treatment with escitalopram prevented depression in post-ACS patients.

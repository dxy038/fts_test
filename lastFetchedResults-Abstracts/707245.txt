The objective of this study was to investigate the diagnostic and therapeutic impact of the 15-lead electrocardiogram (15ECG) on the emergency department (ED) management of chest pain (CP) patients. The design was prospective use of 15ECG with real-time physician survey and retrospective comparison to 12-lead ECG (12ECG). The study took place in a University hospital ED. Adult CP patients participated. During the 15ECG period (June 1996 to July 1996), 595 patients (92% of CP patients) had 15ECG analysis. Diagnoses of acute coronary ischemic syndromes (ACIS) were as follows: 13 acute myocardial infarction (AMI, 7 anterior [ANT], 5 inferior [INF], 1 lateral [LAT], 2 posterior [POST], 1 right ventricular [RV]) and 136 unstable angina (USA) with 47% exhibiting ECG abnormality; the 2 POST and 1 RV AMI occurred in the setting of coexisting INF AMI. The following management strategies were used: 6 fibrinolytic therapy (TT), 4 primary angioplasty (PTCA), 67 rule-out myocardial infarction (ROMI), and 144 admission to critical care unit (CCU). During the 12ECG period (June 1995 to July 1995), 599 patients were encountered. The diagnoses of ACIS were as follows: 11 AMI (5 ANT, 4 INF, 2 LAT) and 146 USA with 51% exhibiting ECG abnormality (P = NS for diagnostic comparisons to 15ECG). The following management strategies were used: 5 TT, 5 PTCA, 59 ROMI, and 137 admission to CCU (P = NS for all treatment comparisons to 15ECG). Of 15ECG cases 81% had completed real-time physician survey, showing that the diagnosis and management ACIS were not altered by the 15ECG; physicians felt, however, that the 15ECG provided a more complete anatomic picture of the ACIS. No false-positive cases of additional lead STE were noted in this investigation except in cases involving abnormal intraventricular conduction such as the bundle branch block scenario. The 15ECG provided a more complete description of myocardial injury without altering the ED diagnosis, ED-based therapy, or hospital disposition in adult CP patients. Further study is required to identify patient subset(s) which may benefit from the 15ECG.

In this work, novel configurations of complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) are introduced to design the high performance of a sharp stop-band band stop filter (BSF). The band stop filters are implemented in microstrip technology by etching complementary split ring resonators (CSRRs) in the ground plane. The structure called metamaterials exhibit a composite right/left handed (CRLH) behaviour and they are of practical interest in microwave engineering. A band stop response with a sharp rejection frequency band is obtained by properly manipulating the structure of the elements. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that by using complementary split ring resonators (CSRRs), further levels of minimization in these band stop filters can be achieved. Furthermore, introducing slots near the CS RR will modify the stop-band considerably. The unit cell of the design is then fabricated and measured. This work proves the capability of CS RR/CPW structure for microwave applications such as filter designs.

This paper considers the stabilization of a synchronous machine connected to an infinite bus via a PID. The PID parameters are tuned using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The optimum controllerÂ´s parameters where found by minimizing an objective function that moved the unstable eigenvalues to the left-hand side of the complex s-plane. The PSO based PID controller was initially designed for a single operating point of the power system and later the design was extended to stabilize multiple operating points to ensure robustness of the controller. The results proved the effectiveness of the PSO tuned PID controller in stabilizing the power system for a wide range of operating points.

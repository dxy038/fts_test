The configuration of support resources is a main factor affecting warship mission reliability. Seeking the balance between support resources and mission reliability to sustain the demands of missions is one of the targets of material support studies. This paper proposes a discrete-event simulation model written in ExtendSim and employs an enhanced evolutionary algorithm for optimizing support resources in requirement of warship mission reliability. This would help military planner determine the best configuration of support resources given objective mission reliability and make support decision in operational support concept design for specific military object.

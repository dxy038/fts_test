Artificial intelligence is widely employed to controlling elevators. On the other hand, we encounter such inefficient situations that all elevators are moving in the same direction or that all elevators come to the same floor even in rush hours of the morning. In order to resolve such situations all elevators should be controlled to assign the best elevator to passengers according time-to-time change of passengers. The group control system is employed in selection of driving patterns according to the change of traffic volumes or driving management in accidents. Such a group control realizes comfortable, safe and economical management of elevators. The objective of this paper is to apply DNA computing to calculate complex and huge combinatorial problems of a group of elevators and huge number of floors. The optimal solution is presented to the group control of elevators on the basis of the DNA computing.

A tree network consisting of communicating processors is considered. The objective is to minimize the processing time by distributing the processing load to other nodes. The effect of the order of load distribution on the processing time is addressed. An algorithm which optimally determines the order of load distribution is developed. It is shown that the order depends only on the channel capacity between nodes but not on the computing capability of each node.

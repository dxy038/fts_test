This paper is concerned with multi-period sequential decision problems for financial asset allocation. A model is proposed in which periodic optimal portfolio adjustments are determined with the objective of minimizing a cumulative risk measure over the investment horizon, while satisfying portfolio diversity constraints at each period and achieving or exceeding a desired terminal expected wealth target. The proposed solution approach is based on a specific affine parameterization of the recourse policy, which allows us to obtain a sub-optimal but exact and explicit problem formulation in terms of a convex quadratic program.

trast to the mainstream stochastic programming approach to multi-period optimization, which has the drawback of being computationally intractable, the proposed setup leads to optimization problems that can be solved efficiently with currently available convex quadratic programming solvers, enabling the user to effectively attack multi-stage decision problems with many securities and periods.

Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 6 weeks of exercise in water and ginger supplementation on cardio metabolic risk factors in obese women with breast cancer.
Subjects and Methods: Breast cancer patients included 40 women with a mean age (48±5.8 yr), weight 
(76 ± 9 kg) and fat mass (41.8±4 kg) were randomly divided into four groups; the placebo, exercise in water + placebo, ginger supplementation and ginger supplements + exercise in water groups. Ginger supplement was consummated for 6 weeks orally 4 capsule (750 mg). Progressive exercise protocol in the exercise in a pool with a width of 15 meters and a depth of 4 meter, 4/week, a sesstion 60-75 min, for 6 weeks. Data of the adiponectin and insulin resistance index were collected at pre-test and post-test and measured by Elisa and HOMA-IR methods, respectively. 
Results: Both ginger supplementation and exercise in the water lead to an increase adiponectin, reduce insulin, insulin resistance and blood glucose was higher than before. However, the combination group showed higher increase of adiponectin and decrease in insulin resistance concentration, as compared to each separate experiment.
Conclusion: These findings show a protective effect of non-pharmacological strategies such as exercise, ginger supplementation and exercise in waster on the cardio-metabolic risk factors in obese women with breast cancer.

With the continuous development and sharpening of smart terminals, the Android Operating System has gradually become one of the mainstream system on mobile platforms for its Open Source and superiority. Since users on-going increasing, it has attracted more and more developers to take part in the development of Android applications. Along with the prosperity of games industry, the games development in Android platform has become a competing objective among games manufacturers. However, the graphics engine, which is regarded as the core of game, determines the vitality of games and affects the process and efficiency of the games development. Meanwhile it also directly affects the value of games in market. Therefore, to develop a good graphics engine has great significances. However, through a deep analysis in related works, we find that most development of games engines is too simple. They lack the completed documentation or the good performance. Moreover, their biggest drawback is the poor support in Chinese. It seriously impacts the customersÂ´ satisfaction. For above shortcomings, in this paper, we design and implement text spirits and an animation module of graphics engine on Android platform. Based on JAVA and OpenGL ES, this work designs and implements static text spirits and dynamic text spirits. Considering the movement property of animation spirits, we also implement simple physics rules.

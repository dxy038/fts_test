This paper aims to validate a head mounted inertial interface to characterize disorder movements in people with cerebral palsy (CP). The kinematic patterns extracted from this study will be used to design an alternative communication channel (using head motion) adapted to userÂ´s capabilities and limitations. Four people with CP participated (GMFCS level V) and three healthy subjects as reference group. The main outcome measures were divided into 1) Time-domain, 2) Frequency-domain and 3) Spatial domain. Results showed that the inertial interface succeeds assessing the pathological motion. Firstly, the system differentiates between voluntary and involuntary motion in terms of motor control, frequency and range of motion. Secondly some motion disorders such as hypertonia, hypotonia can be identified. These results suggest that people with motor disorders could benefit from the developed inertial system in three fields: 1) diagnosis of motor disorder by means of an objective quantification, 2) physical and cognitive rehabilitation by means of proprioceptive enhancement through visual-motor feedback and 3) functional compensation by means of an inertial person-machine interface for controlling computer and assistive devices (e.g. wheelchairs or walkers).

Objective
We sought to describe irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) treatment among women with chronic pelvic pain.
Study design
We performed a cross-sectional study of new chronic pelvic pain patients between 1993 and 2000 (n = 987). IBS was defined by Rome I criteria. IBS treatment was defined as lower gastrointestinal drugs or referral. Analyses were descriptive and multivariable.
Results
IBS occurred in 35% of patients. In the highest quartile of pain, women with IBS were not more likely to have IBS treatment initiated. In the lowest three quarters of pain, women with IBS were 5.08 times more likely to have IBS treatment initiated. IBS was not diagnosed 40% of the time. IBS treatments were not recommended to 67% of patients with IBS. More than 35% of patients were prescribed narcotics.
Conclusion
IBS is not consistently diagnosed and treated even in a pelvic pain clinic. Yet, treatment of IBS may reduce the overall abdominal pain of these patients.

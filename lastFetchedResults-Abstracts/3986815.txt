The development of the so-called one-month chip is explored in a five-part special report by IEEE Spectrum editors. The objective is to describe the functions required of an as yet nonexistent integrated circuit, then have it delivered in 31 days or less. The technological underpinnings of the new trend are examined from the standpoints of design, fabrication, and testing. The report is based on extensive interviews with engineers from all aspects of IC manufacturing and includes two round-table discussions with experts.

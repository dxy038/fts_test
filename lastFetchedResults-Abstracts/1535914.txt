Tuberculosis (TB) transmission is enhanced by systematic exposure to an infectious individual. This enhancement usually takes place at either the home, workplace, and/or school (generalized household). Typical epidemiological models do not incorporate the impact of generalized households on the study of disease dynamics. Models that incorporate cluster (generalized household) effects and focus on their impact on TB's transmission dynamics are developed. Detailed models that consider the effect of casual infections, that is, those generated outside a cluster, are also presented. We find expressions for the Basic Reproductive Number as a function of cluster size. The formula for R0separates the contributions of cluster and casual infections in the generation of secondary TB infections. Relationships between cluster and classical epidemic models are discussed as well as the concept of critical cluster size.

This paper presents a novel, fast and accurate appearance-based method for infrared face recognition. By introducing the Optimum-Path Forest classifier, our objective is to get good recognition rates and effectively reduce the computational effort. The feature extraction procedure is carried out by PCA, and the results are compared to two other well known supervised learning classifiers; Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The achieved performance asserts the promise of the proposed framework.

A description is presented of a graduate course on modeling and control in power electronics. The mutual reinforcement of lecture and laboratory allows the introduction of a considerable number of concepts, including large-signal modeling of switching DC-to-DC power converters, resonant power converter design, and nonlinear control of bidirectional structures. The course is divided into the following sections: fundamentals of DC-to-DC conversion; converter design; switching regulator control; and large-signal modeling and control

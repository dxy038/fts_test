This paper proposes a decision-making framework, based on stochastic programming, for a retailer: 1) to determine the sale price of electricity to the customers based on time-of-use (TOU) rates, and 2) to manage a portfolio of different contracts in order to procure its demand and to hedge against risks, within a medium-term period. Supply sources include the pool, self-production facilities and several instruments such as forward contracts, call options, and interruptible contracts. The objective is to maximize the profit and simultaneously to minimize the risks in terms of a multi-period risk measure. Moreover, the risks are measured using conditional value at risk (CVaR) methodology. The reaction of the customers to the retailersÂ´ selling prices as well as the competition between the retailers is modeled through a market share function. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer stochastic programming. It is solved by a decomposition technique, and the decomposed parts are solved by a branch-and-bound algorithm.

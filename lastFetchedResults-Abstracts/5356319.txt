The main objective of the work was to develop the telematic system supporting intensive insulin treatment of the newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients and to assess clinical efficacy of the system. The TeleMed system is made up of: the patient´s mobile unit, the diabetologist´s mobile unit, the central clinical server and the diabetologist´s workstations. All patient-collected data are stored in the electronic logbook of the patient´s unit and are automatically transmitted to the diabetologist´s unit and to the server. The efficacy of the system has been assessed in the open single arm study with 3 days run-in period and 3 weeks study period. Preliminary results on 4 patients demonstrated that the treatment supported by the system resulted in: significant improvement of glycemic control described by the J-index (27.4&#177;14.4 to 20.1&#177;8.9), significant reduction of the daily insulin dose (34.6&#177;7.6 U to 21.2&#177;9.0 U), significant reduction of the number of hyperglycemic episodes and elimination of the hypoglycemic episodes. The system was accepted by the patients and physicians. Application of the TeleMed demonstrated that it is reliable and easy to use.

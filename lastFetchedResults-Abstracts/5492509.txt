A novel method for stability margin maximization is presented. The study is formulated as a design parameter optimization problem, with specific application to power system stabilizers. This method is based on necessary and sufficient conditions required by stability matrices, which are included as additional constraints to the nonlinear optimization problem. The objective function uses eigenvalue sensitivities, for which a new and very efficient algorithm is developed. This algorithm tracks the determinant of a matrix to determine the truncation order of the expansion required to yield a prescribed accuracy. The objective function is formulated in terms of two separate sets of eigenvalues, defined as critical and noncritical, demanding optimal shift of the former while limiting the shifts of the latter. Thus the existence of a solution guarantees a stable condition

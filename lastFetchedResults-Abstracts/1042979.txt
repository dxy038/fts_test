The objective of this paper is to analyze the temperature distributions and heat affected zone in skin tissue medium when irradiated with either a collimated or a focused laser beam from a short pulse laser source. Experiments are performed on multi-layer tissue phantoms simulating skin tissue with embedded inhomogeneities simulating subsurface tumors and as well as on freshly excised mouse skin tissue samples. Two types of lasers have been used in this study – namely a Q-switched pulsed 1064 nm Nd:YAG short pulse laser having a pulse width of 200 ns and a 1552 nm diode short pulsed laser having a pulse width of 1.3 ps. Experimental measurements of axial and radial temperature distribution in the tissue medium are compared with the numerical modeling results. For numerical modeling, the transient radiative transport equation is first solved using a discrete ordinates method for obtaining the intensity distribution and radiative heat flux inside the tissue medium. Then the temperature distribution is obtained by coupling the bio-heat transfer equation with either hyperbolic non-Fourier or parabolic Fourier heat conduction model. The hyperbolic heat conduction equation is solved using MacCormack’s scheme with error terms correction. It is observed that experimentally measured temperature distribution is in good agreement with that predicted by hyperbolic heat conduction model. The experimental measurements demonstrate that converging laser beam focused directly at the subsurface location can produce desired high temperature at that location compared to that produced by collimated laser beam for the same laser parameters. Finally the ablated tissue removal is characterized using histological studies as a function of laser parameters.

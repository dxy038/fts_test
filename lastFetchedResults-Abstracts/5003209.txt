This paper presents a study of EEG pattern for smokers based on Theta, Alpha and Beta Band power using Power Spectral Density (PSD). Smoking cigarettes is a bad habit, but the numbers of smokers keep growing. Most smokers gives `to release stress´ as a reason for smoking. The objective of this research is to investigate smokers´ EEG pattern with the hypothesis that they will have higher Alpha Band power compared to non-smokers. 33 male smokers and 33 non-smokers were sampled for this research. EEG data was recorded for 5 minutes. Results shown that there is higher Theta Band power and higher Alpha Band power for smokers compared to non-smoker.

Lifestyle Profile (HPLP). The data were analyzed by tests of Pearson correlation

0.001), benefits of medical treatment (r= -0.35; p <  0.001), total score of health
promoting lifestyle (r= -0.67; p  <  0.001), its components, namely health responsibility
(r= -0.54; p  <  0.001), physical activity (r= -0.42; p  <  0.001), nutrition (r=
-0.42; p  <  0.001), spiritual growth (r= -0.55; p  <  0.001), interpersonal relationships
(r= -0.57; p  <  0.001), and stress management (r= -0.64; p  <  0.001). Regression
analyses also revealed that 44% of variance of pregnancy anxiety of

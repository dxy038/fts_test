OBJECTIVE: The efficacy, safety, and antibiotic-related charges for once-daily gentamicin with twice-daily clindamycin were compared with those of thrice-daily dosing of these antibiotics.
STUDY DESIGN: Patients with puerperal endometritis or with chorioamnionitis in labor assessed to be at risk for endometritis were randomized to receive gentamicin 4 mg/kg intravenously every 24 hours with clindamycin 1200 mg intravenously every 12 hours (experimental arm) or gentamicin 1.33 mg/kg intravenously and clindamycin 800 mg intravenously every 8 hours (conventional dosing interval arm). Primary outcomes included cure rates, mean length of treatment, antibiotic-related charges, and nephrotoxicity. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to control for confounding variables.
RESULTS: There were 135 and 137 patients randomized to the experimental and conventional interval arms, respectively. Cures were obtained in 94.1% and 87.6% of patients in the experimental and conventional arms, respectively (p = 0.06). The experimental arm had mean antibiotic charges of $250.79 versus $442.49 in the conventional arm (p< 0.0001). There was no permanent nephrotoxicity in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily gentamicin dosing with twice-daily clindamycin dosing is as efficacious and safe as the thrice-daily dosing of gentamicin and clindamycin for peripartum uterine infection. The experimental regimen results in substantial cost savings. The incidence of nephrotoxicity is low. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:786-92.)

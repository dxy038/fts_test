In addition to be the major metabolites of cholesterol, bile acids are also served as key regulators for nuclear receptors LXR, FXR, PXR and VDR and maintain blood lipid homostasis. Objective: to study the oral effects of bile acids and derivatives on blood lipids of ApoE gene single-knockout mice. Methods: Using ApoE gene single-knockout mice as experimental subjects, bile acids and derivatives were used as experimental medicine to find out the regulation of nuclear receptors on blood lipid concentration. Results: Total serum cholesterol and triglycerides increased in cholic Acid (600mg/kg/d) and hyodeoxycholic Acid (600mg/kg/d) treatment group; total cholesterol raised by LXR agonists hyodeoxycholic acid dimethyl Amide (200mg/kg/d) and Gynostemma pentaphyllum extract derivative (200mg/kg/d); triglycerides decreased in FXR agonist dehydroxycholic Acid group (200mg/kg/d). Conclusion: hyodeoxycholic acid does not suppress hepatic bile acid synthesis. This study provides positive evidence for treatment of hyperlipidemia using bile acid derivatives.

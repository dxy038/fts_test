The objective of this study was to develop a 1:4 power divider with high levels of symmetry and isolation between the ports. While the Wilkinson type divider offers high isolation between the ports and the radial divider offers high tracking between the ports, it is sought that a combination of the two concepts will comply with both requirements. The divider was simulated and optimized by CST. The curved and unusual line shapes showed that isolations of -15 to -30 dB and perfect amplitude and phase tracking are feasible at bandwidth of 60%. A prototype model demonstrated somewhat degraded results (tracking of 0.2 dB and 9&#176;) but comparable with state-of-the-art products.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between preterm premature rupture of membranes, tumor necrosis factor-α, and heat shock protein-70 gene polymorphisms in multifetal gestations.
Study design
Buccal swabs from 101 mother-neonate pairs of multifetal pregnancies were tested for single nucleotide polymorphisms at position −308 of the tumor necrosis factor-α gene and +1267 of the heat shock protein–70 gene. Pregnancy outcome data were obtained subsequently.
Results
Tumor necrosis factor-α allele 2 carriage by the first-born occurred in 10 of 27 pregnancies (37.0%) that resulted in preterm premature rupture of membranes compared with 6 of 67 pregnancies (9.0%) without preterm premature rupture of membranes (P = .002). The allele frequency of tumor necrosis factor-α allele 2 and heat shock protein–70 allele 2 in the first born was higher in pregnancies that were complicated by preterm premature rupture of membranes (18.5% vs 4.5%; P = .003; and 57.7% vs 41.3%; P = .04, respectively). There was no relationship between tumor necrosis factor-α allele 2 or heat shock protein-70 allele 2 carriage by the second fetus or mother and preterm premature rupture of membranes.
Conclusion
Tumor necrosis factor-α allele 2 and/or heat shock protein-70 allele 2 carriage by the first-born fetus is associated with preterm premature rupture of membranes in multifetal pregnancies.

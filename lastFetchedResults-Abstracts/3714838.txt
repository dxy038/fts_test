This paper deals with cross-layer measurements for the efficient analysis of Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T) system performance. In particular, valuable relationships between some cross-layer DVB-T system parameters are investigated through measurements conducted at the physical and application layers. Specifically, channel power, error vector magnitude, and modulation error ratio are assessed at the physical layer, whereas objective video quality indices are estimated at the application layer. To this aim, a number of real-life experiments are executed through a purposely developed testbed that enlists a suitable DVB-T transmission platform and real-life receivers. The ultimate goal is to highlight the importance of cross-layer measurements in the analysis and troubleshooting of DVB-T system operation and to show how to deduce from such measurements practical information and hints to be profitably used in the design and setup of any DVB-T broadcasting system.

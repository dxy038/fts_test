Iran is one of the main producers of caviar. The main objective of this study was to rank export goal markets of caviar and investigates Iran's relative advantages in exporting this commodity from 2000 though 2005. Data set were obtained from United Nation, World Bank, International Trade Center, and World Trade Organization database. For investigating Iran's relative advantages in caviar exporting, Revealed Comparative Advantage's index was applied. For ranking of export goal markets Riddle and Numerical Taxonomy processes were used. Indexes that were used in these two processes for each importer country include mean value of caviar import, the ratio of caviar import value to total world's caviar import value, the ratio of caviar import value to total import value of each country, import preference index, coefficient of variance of caviar import value, and increase in caviar import value's demand. The results of this study revealed that Iran had relative advantages in caviar exporting in all studied years. Riddle process suggest Japan, South Korea, Oman, France and Norway respectively and Numerical Taxonomy process suggest Sweden, Germany, South Korea, England and Cyprus as the best alternatives for caviar exporting.

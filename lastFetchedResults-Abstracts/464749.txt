OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to test whether cocaine stimulates uterine activity in nonpregnant and pregnant rats. STUDY DESIGN: The carotid artery and jugular vein were chronically catheterized, and a microballoon probe was inserted into the uterine cavity of 15 pregnant and 14 nonpregnant female rats. Conscious animals received a bolus dose of either cocaine or saline solution intravenously. Cardiovascular and uterine contractile responses were studied. RESULTS: Cocaine (2.5 mg/kg) induced a marked increase in uterine activity and arterial blood pressure in both pregnant and nonpregnant animals without producing systemic toxicity. The maximum change in uterine contractions was greater in the pregnant group than in the nonpregnant group, and blood pressure responses were transient in both. CONCLUSION: This study is the first demonstration that cocaine stimulates the rat uterus in vivo, with a greater increase in contractions in pregnant compared with nonpregnant animals. These differences are not related to the hemodynamic response or pharmacokinetic profile of cocaine. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:188-93.)

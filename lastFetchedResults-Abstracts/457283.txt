Evidences suggest that lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, literature has been controversial in confirming its role as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the association between serum levels of Lp(a) and ischemic heart disease as well as other cardiovascular risk factors in a population-based study conducted on a local cohort of the Brazilian population.
Lp(a) serum levels were measured in 400 individuals selected from a larger sample of a populational survey carried out in Ouro Preto, a city in the southeast of Brazil. Lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, anthropometric and clinical parameters were analyzed.
Lp(a) levels were significantly associated with the presence of ischemic heart disease. In relation to other cardiovascular risk factors, it was verified that Lp(a) levels were statistically associated with age, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and percentage of body fat determined by bioelectric impedance. Lp(a) was also highly associated with the Framingham risk score (p = 0.003). In a multivariate analysis two significant interactions were revealed; one involving ischemic heart disease, sex and age and other associating ischemic heart disease, age and total cholesterol.
In summary, in the present analysis Lp(a) serum levels were correlated with the occurrence of ischemic heart disease and other cardiovascular risk factors.

Objectives
ontia is defined as the congenital absence of 6 or more permanent teeth excluding the third molar. The occurrence of non-syndromic still remains poorly understood, but in recent years some cases have been reported where mutations or polymorphisms of PAX9 and MSX1 had been associated with non-syndromic oligodontia. The objective of the present work was to study the phenotype and genotype of three generations of a Han Chinese family affected by non-syndromic autosomal-dominant oligodontia.

mined all individuals of the oligodontia family by clinical and radiographic examinations. Based on clinical manifestations, candidate genes MSX1 and PAX9 were picked up to analyse and screen mutations.
s
 evaluation showed that the most commonly missing teeth are the mandibular second premolars, followed by the maxillary second premolars and maxillary lateral incisors, and subsequently the maxillary first premolars. The probability of missing a particular type of tooth is not always bilaterally symmetrical, and differences exist between maxilla and mandible. PCR-SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing revealed a novel missense mutation c.662C&gt;A in a highly conserved homeobox sequence of MSX1 and a known polymorphisms c.347C&gt;G.
sion
nding suggests the missense transversion (c.662C&gt;A) and the polymorphisms (c.347C&gt;G) may be responsible for oligodontia phenotype in this Chinese family.

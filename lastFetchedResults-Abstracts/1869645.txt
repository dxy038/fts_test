The role that inflammation plays in cancer is puzzling. In peripheral blood, TNF-α-producing monocytes (CD14+ cells) were compared among patients with lung cancer, patients with tuberculosis and healthy donors; also, in pleural effusion TNF-α-producing CD14+ cells were compared between tuberculous patients and lung cancer patients. To analyze the level of the cellular alteration in TNF-α production, an experimental model was set up. TNF-α-producing CD14+ cells in peripheral blood from lung cancer patients were significantly lower than those from healthy donors. In pleural effusion, TNF-α-producing CD14+ cells were significantly lower in lung cancer patients than in tuberculous patients. Based on the results obtained from an experimental model, we suggest that this phenomenon was attributed to a reduced expression of TNF-α transcript. These findings provide evidence that lung carcinomas reduce TNF-α production by macrophages, possibly by inducing in these cells an M2 phenotype, which favor tumor progression.

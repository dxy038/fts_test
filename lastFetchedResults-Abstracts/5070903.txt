A modified and simplified five-parameter model is presented based on the Torrance-Sparrow model. Multi-angle bistatic data of the surfaces of various materials and roughness are fitted by using this model. The results of five-parameter model are in good agreement with the measured data, and closing to the results of two-dimensional bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models. The five-parameter model shows a good applicability to various surface roughness and different optical materials. The combined algorithm of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm takes a key role on the salvation of the process of optimization to get the parameters. The five parameters model can be used to construct a 3D BRDF distribution based on the spatial measured data, which may provide more information of light scattering from rough surfaces.

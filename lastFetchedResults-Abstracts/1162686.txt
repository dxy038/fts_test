In periodic monitoring, the main problem is determining the inspection interval of condition monitoring. For this problem, the decision variable is represented by the time of next inspection of condition monitoring. There are several studies that deal with prescribing inspection intervals. But only a few of these allow the decision maker to observe simultaneously more than one aspect. This does not accord with the natural tendency of the decision maker who desires to see the decision problem from a broader perspective, by having different viewpoints or dimensions of choices. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to propose a decision model, which can simultaneously determine inspection intervals for condition monitoring regarding the failure behavior of equipment to be inspected, features of maintainability and decision maker preferences about cost and downtime.

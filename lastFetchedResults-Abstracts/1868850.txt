Objective: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients produce autoantibodies to HRES-1/p28, a human endogenous retrovirus-encoded nuclear protein. To identify cross-reactive viral antigens capable of triggering autoreactivity, HRES-1/p28 epitopes were mapped by SLE antibodies. Methods: Forty-four peptides overlapping HRES-1/p28 and 13 viral peptides were synthesized on cellulose membrane and tested for recognition by antibodies from 16 HRES-1 Western blot seropositive SLE patients. Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) was detected by gene amplification in sera of 211 SLE patients, 78 healthy SLE family members, 199 unrelated healthy donors, and 91 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Results: HRES-1/p28 residues 41–55, 121–135, and 156–170 were recognized by 12/16 (75.0%), 11/16 (68.8%), and 9/16 lupus sera (56.25%) and considered immunodominant. HRES-1/p28 residues 121–135 harbor cross-reactive epitope with retroviral peptides and the 70 K U1snRNP lupus autoantigen. HRES-1/p28 residues 41–55 and 156–170 exhibited the highest prevalence of cross-reactivity with TTV peptide ORF2a (14/16, 87%). Prevalence of TTV DNA was increased in lupus patients (120/211) with respect to healthy (66/199; P &lt; 0.0001) or RA controls (23/91; P &lt; 0.0001). TTV prevalence in healthy lupus relatives (40/78) was decreased with respect to lupus patients (80/121; P = 0.0184) and increased with respect to unrelated healthy donors (66/199; P = 0.0026). HRES-1/p28 Western blot reactivity was observed in 12/23 TTV PCR-negative donors and 43/58 TTV PCR-positive donors (P &lt; 0.0281). Conclusions: Increased prevalence of TTV and molecular mimicry with HRES-1/p28 may contribute to generation of antinuclear antibodies and pathogenesis of SLE.

A simultaneous 4-level bidirectional I/O interface for high-speed DRAM is presented. It performs at a data rate of 4Gb/s/pin with the use of a 500MHz clock generator and a full CMOS power rail swing. This I/O interface is fabricated on a 0.10&#956;m DRAM CMOS process in 330x66&#956;m<sup>2</sup>. The transceiver performs 200mVx690ps passing eye-windows on the channel over 1.8V supply.

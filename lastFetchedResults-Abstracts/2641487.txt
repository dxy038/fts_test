Steganography is the science and art of hiding communication in a media like image, audio, and so on in order to hide any communication between the transmitter and receiver of a message. Nowadays internet and electronic communication networks are rapidly progressing. However, there are many issues and problems in the course of their employment. The most important of these is the security of sent message through these communication channels. So, we need a secure network to send data through these channels. Cryptography is one method for this purpose. But, as Cryptography transforms the main message into a disordered and imperceptible one, it causes doubt and suspicion to the opponents and supervisors of these networks. Secure approaches of watermarking, by hiding encrypted secret message in a media like image, can overcome this problem. In this article by reviewing some of the techniques of embedding message into image, especially those known as LSB and LSB2 ones, we propose a new technique for this work which is known as ELSB2. We have designed this algorithm in such a way that it shows more resistance against lousy processing such as filtering and compression, which easily destroy information embedded into image.  After introducing the above mentioned techniques, we implement and compare them.

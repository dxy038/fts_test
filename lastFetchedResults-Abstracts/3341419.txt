The objective of this research is to develop a system model and an intelligent controller for the meat drying process, which will lead to better control accuracy than the current PID control system used in meat manufacturing. In meat drying rooms, temperature and relative humidity are coupled by nonlinear thermodynamic laws. The coupling results in nonlinear fluctuations in relative humidity. The classical PID control method is not able to effectively control the relative humidity. The models of the systems of temperature and relative humidity for a meat drying room in this paper include the model of the plant, the model of the coupling, the controller, and the complete control system of the meat drying room. The proposed intelligent control uses the methods of a fuzzy PID controller to limit the fluctuations in the meat drying system. Results show that the performance of the proposed fuzzy PID control systems is superior in terms of relative humidity control to the classical PID control method used in the current control systems for the meat drying rooms.

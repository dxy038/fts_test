This paper presents a high-performance design of dc-dc switching power converter system, which can deliver a regulated 0-50V and 0-15A output. The full-bridge phase-shift converter is realized with zero voltage switching and UCC3895 IC to achieve higher efficiency and pulse width modulation. For wide range of adjustable voltage output control, a PI gain-scheduling control scheme is proposed and implemented using a conventional FPGA chip. Experimental results justify the feasibility and performance of the proposed power converter control system.

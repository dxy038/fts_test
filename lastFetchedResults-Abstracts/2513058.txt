<p align="left"><strong>Objective:</strong> Urogynecologists are constantly looking for simple, safe and effective ways to cure vaginal apex prolapse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of posterior intravaginal slingplasty (PIVS).<br /><strong>Materials and methods</strong>: A total of 38 patients with advanced vaginal apical prolapse underwent posterior intravaginal slingplasty in Vali-e-Asr hospital in Tehran. In this clinical trial (before-after study), demographic, pre-operative, operative details and post-operative follow-up data were collected for all patients. The data were analyzed using SPSS software and Mac Nemar test.Â  P&lt;0.05 was considered for statistical significance.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: The mean for patients' age was 67 (50-81) years, for operation time was 35 (25-45) minutes and for blood loss was 125 (70-300) ml. No intraoperative rectal perforation was observed and there was a significant difference in patients' symptoms such as pelvic pain, nocturia, urgency and urinary tract infection before and after the surgery (p &lt; 0.001).<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: PIVS had similar efficacy with other studies in the treatment of vaginal vault prolapse. The procedure reduces the complication rate and shortens the rehabilitation period with a satisfying result.</p>

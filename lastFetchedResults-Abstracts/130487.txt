Objective: The effect of activity of adenosine A2A receptors of the CAI region of the hippocampus on piriform cortex-kindled seizures was investigated in rats.
Material and Methods: After electrical kindling of animals, CGS21680 hydrochloride (CGS), an adenosine A2A receptors agonist, at doses of 10, 200 and 500 }iM and ZM241385 (ZM), an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, at doses of 50 and 100 µM were microinjected into the CAI region of the hippocampus. The animals were stimulated 15 min after drug injection. In each case, 24 h prior to the drug injection, animals received ACSF (drug solvent) and were stimulated in the same way and results were recorded as control values. At least 6 rats were used in each group.
Results: Bilateral microinjection of CGS, at doses of 200 and 500 µM into the hippocampal CAI region increased the after discharge duration (ADD) and had no effects on S4L, S5D and SD. Bilateral microinjection of ZM had no effect on seizure parameters. Pretreatment of animals with ZM (50 µM) before CGS (200 04), prevented the effect of CGS on seizure parameters significantly.
Conclusion: Thus, it may be suggested that the adenosine A2A receptors of the hippocampal CAI region may have a facilitatory role in seizure activities elicited from the piriform cortex.

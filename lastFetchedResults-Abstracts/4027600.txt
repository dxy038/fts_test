To overcome drawbacks and limitations of planar lightwave circuit based modules for bidirectional communications, such as the demand for several chips and in consequence more packaging efforts, we have recently developed a novel optical coupling technique using our unique 155 Mbps bidirectional laser chip. Since the chip is structured with a pin-photodiode monolithically integrated on a laser diodeÂ´s waveguide, the optical coupling requires only the alignment of the chip with a fiber. To optically couple the laser diode and photodiode simultaneously with a single fiber, we have designed an unusual coupling structure using a fiber having a cleaved surface whose normal is 35&#176; angled to the fiber core axis, and using an index-controlling medium with a refractive index of &#8764;1.3. The bidirectional chip is flip-chip bonded and the fiber is passively aligned using a V-groove on the same substrate of 2.5&#215;1.3 mm<sup>2</sup> in size. Even with this extremely small and simple scheme for bidirectional optical coupling, we could obtain an optical output power of -7&#8764;-10 dBm and a responsivity of &lt;-30 dBm, which are satisfactory to the STM-1 level telecommunications specifications.

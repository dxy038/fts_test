The paper is focused on electromagnetic field modeling and wireless transmission of electromagnetic energy by using the Boundary Element Method. Fundamental aspects considered in this work include a mathematical model, the view of tangential basis functions and the implementation of the singularity subtraction method. The aim of research is the numerical modeling of electromagnetic fields spawned by harmonic sources of current and the study of wireless transmission of energy. The objective of this paper is the implementation of the Boundary Element Method as one of the most numerically effective ways to solve the electromagnetic problem. The relevance of this work is the replacement of the conventional Finite Element Method (FEM) by the Boundary Element Method (BEM) or their combined use. To overcome this difficulty BEM is used because it needs a surface mesh only and does not need any volume meshes. Thus, it works with bounded and unbounded computational domains. But this method is designed only for piecewise constant material functions and can hardly be implemented to the problems with non-linear parameters. But this case is beyond this paper.

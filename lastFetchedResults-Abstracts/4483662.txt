Based on the simplified hypersonic air-breathing propulsion model, this paper studies the output regulation/ safety protection multi-objective switching control problem focusing on the safety boundaries existing during the working progressing. Command switching strategy based on the safety margin is researched. In the safe region with a sufficiently large safety margin, the regulation loop is active and the regulated output is controlled to track the reference signal as quickly as possible. But the protected loop will be switched on and the protected output will be forced to escape from dangers once the safety boundaries approach. A dynamical state feedback controller and a protection controller work in turn in a hysteresis switching way to guarantee the asymptotic tracking with certain safety performance. The conditions under which the asymptotic tracking could be guaranteed are given and the control parameters could be calculated by solving optimal problems. It is pointed out in this paper that the designing of the regulation controller and the protection controller could be implemented separately, and the control parameters could be optimized to get certain optimal performance index using numerical method. Finally, simulation researches are performed to verify the effectiveness of the given methods, which also indicate that the commands switching control can improve both safety margin and the dynamical performance indices than the single controller.

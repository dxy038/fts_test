This paper presents a complete design methodology and construction techniques for integrated LC and LCT components. It is shown that a discrete series resonant LC circuit with a voltage clamp can be replaced by a planar integrated LC operating at high frequency and high power levels, with an integrated passive voltage clamp (LCT). An extension of the capacitive section of the integrated LC makes it possible to construct a very low impedance resonant busbar for power converters. The final objective of this technology is a fully integrated flat DC/AC power convertor module

Spectrum sharing is envisaged to allow multiple cognitive radio (CR) nodes to jointly use the vacant spectrum resource for opportunistic transmission. Most previous work on the spectrum sharing did not take into account the spectrum heterogeneity, such as different transmission ranges, error rates, etc. In this paper, a spectrum sharing algorithm is presented that accommodates spectrum heterogeneity for centralized CR networks, meanwhile the individual users are free to be mobile. Each node is uniquely assigned a channel while considering its channel occupancy time, the location of the node, and the fairness of channel access opportunity. Each of these metrics contributes in part to a larger optimization problem and the final objective is to maximize the total utility of system. Simulations results reveal significant improvement in reducing spectrum handoffs.

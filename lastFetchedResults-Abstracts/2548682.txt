In the real world, risk and uncertainty are two natural properties in the implementation of Mega projects. Most projects fail to achieve the pre-determined objectives due to uncertainty. A linear integer programming optimization model was used in this work to solve a problem in order to choose the most appropriate risk responses for the project risks. A mathematical model, in which work structure breakdown, risk occurrences, risk reduction measures, and their effects are clearly related to each other, is proposed to evaluate and select the project risk responses. The model aims at optimization of defined criteria (objectives) of the project. Unlike similar previous studies, in this study, the relationship between risk responses during implementation has been considered. The model is capable of considering and optimizing different criteria in the objective function depending on the kind of project. In addition, a case study related to petroleum projects is presented, and the corresponding figures are analyzed.

The K-user interference channel describes K wireless pairs sharing the same spectrum simultaneously through the use of multiple antennas. In this paper, we present fast joint beamformer design to simultaneously minimize leakage interference (LI) and maximize both the individual signal powers (SPs) and the SINRs. This is a multi-objective, multi- variable problem which is treated here for the first time. We show that a fixed point of a nonexpansive vector field is guaranteed. This fixed point is a solution because it is a stationary point of the equally weighted sum of objective functions. Moreover, this stationary point ensures a minimum quality of service (QoS) for all users. Simulation demonstrates that the solution of the LI-SP-SINR problem is superior to max min SINR by having both a lower symbol error rate and a higher sum rate. Finding the solution also has lower complexity than MSE minimization and the max min SINR problem.

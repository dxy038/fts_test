This paper proposes the theory and application of a new designing method of the Fractional Order PID (FOPID) controller for boost converters. FOPID is a PID where the derivation and integration orders are of fractional order rather than integer. A FOPID is an extension to classic integer order PID controllers, that potentially promises better results. The method is based on the use of a Multi-Objective optimization evolutionary algorithm called Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA). Other controller methods cannot guarantee a good start-up response but the proposed method can provide an excellent start-up response besides desired dynamic response. The optimum fractional order PID coefficients for the desired control objectives are included and designers can implement each of them based on objective functions priority. A comparison between the optimum integer order PID controller and optimum fractional order PID controller is presented in the paper. The simulation and some experimental results prove the superiority of the fractional controllers over the integer controllers.

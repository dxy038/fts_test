In this paper we present a new model-based method to code the transform coefficients of audio signals. The histogram of transform coefficients is approximated by a generalized Gaussian model for efficient model-based bit allocation and the spectrum is coded by scalar quantization followed by arithmetic coding. An example coder operating at 16 kHz and using predictive modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) coding is described. We compare the performance of the proposed coder with ITU-T G.722.1. Objective and subjective quality results are presented. The proposed coder is better than ITU-T G.722.1 at 24 kbit/s and equivalent at 32 kbit/s.

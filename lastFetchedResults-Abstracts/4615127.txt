High-speed and high-penetration swept-source optical coherence tomography (HSHP-SS-OCT) system is developed based on 1-&#956;m short cavity laser. Doppler OCT processing is applied with custom made OCT phase stabilization algorithm which doesnÂ´t sacrifice measurement range not as like a conventional phase stabilization mirror. The bidirectional blood flow in deep choroid was successfully obtained.

A methodology called the sensitivity tree, which can be easily used to form an expert system for real-time control, is proposed. Based on this methodology, an expert system for the control of voltage and reactive power of a power system is developed. The main objective of this expert system is to help the operator detect buses experiencing abnormal conditions, select the most effective control measures, and calculate the control actions required to overcome the voltage violation. The control measures used to alleviate the voltage problem are capacitor compensation, transformer tap changes, and generator terminal voltage changes. By keeping the bus voltage in the entire system within limits, system security is increased. The expert system is written in the PROLOG language. Simulation studies with this expert system applied to a 30-bus power system show satisfactory results

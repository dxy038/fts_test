A state transition design support system which supports the design and the test phase of communication software has been developed in order to improve productivity and maintainability in software development for communication systems. In this system, a subset of the CCITT SDL (Specification and Description Language) is adopted. The system has a bidirectional (top-down and bottom-up) support function. The support system was used for developing electronic switching systems and electronic mail systems. It was found that this system not only boosts software productivity and quality but also improves document maintainability

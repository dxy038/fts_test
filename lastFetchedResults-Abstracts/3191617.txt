Self-healing is the most important characteristic of smart grid, and its content including two parts: self-adjustment at normal state and self-restoration at breakdown state. In distribution network, the objective of self-healing control is supply users ceaseless electric power. The paper proposes a rapid heuristic restoration algorithm to achieve the process from breakdown state to normal state. Combined with the mathematical model of breakdown state restoration of the power distribution network, make the process into five parts including self-support feeder restoration, whole area restoration, partition restoration, transfer load by lower level feeder and cut load, and get the suitable feasible solution set of power supply restoration. Find the optimal from the solution set with fuzzy comprehensive evaluation theory, and prove the validity of algorithm by example.

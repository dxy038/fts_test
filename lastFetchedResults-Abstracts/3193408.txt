In this paper a fuzzy multi-objective framework is introduced for the optimal power flow optimization problem. The objective functions that are considered in this work are minimizing the total fuel cost, voltage stability index and the total voltage deviation of the system. In the first case each of these items are optimized individually and in the next section using the fuzzy multi objective approach these objective functions are transformed to a single objective function. The fuzzy adaptive PSO approach has been used to solve the optimization problem, also the solution has been tested on the IEEE 30 bus system.

Soybean is one of the most important oil crops in Iran. The objective of this study was to develop a soybean growth and yield simulation model for the use in analyzing the effects of climate, soil, crop management and cultivar characteristic (habit cultivar) on soybean yield under north Khorasan conditions. Crop growth aspects were arranged in sub-models including phonological development, 
leaf area variations, dry matter production and partitioning. A soil water balance sub-model was included to simulated soil water dynamics and severity of water stress. The model uses a daily time step and readily available weather, soil and crop management. The model was tested for north Khorasan conditions. The observed grain yield varied from 2600 to 4800 kg-1ha with mean 3600 kg-1ha. Also, range for simulated grain yield was between 3060 to 4100 kg-1ha with mean 3640 kg-1ha. The regression coefficients of observed grain yield against simulated grain yield (a=1799±759, b=0.51±0.25) on based confidence limits 95% hadn’t significant difference with 1:1 line coefficients (a=0, b=1). The coefficient of determination (R2) and index of agreement (d) was 0.67 and 0.85, respectively. Root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of variations were estimated 458.3 kg-1ha and 12.6%, respectively. It was concluded that this model could be used for estimation of grain yield against with proper precision under north Khorasan conditions.

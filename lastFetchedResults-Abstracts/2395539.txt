Recently, all the craters from the major currently available manually assembled catalogues have been merged into the catalogue with 57 633 known Martian impact craters (MA57633GT). In addition, the work on crater detection algorithm (CDA), developed to search for still uncatalogued impact craters using 1/128° MOLA data, resulted in MA115225GT. In parallel with this work another CDA has been developed which resulted in the Stepinski catalogue containing 75 919 craters (MA75919T). The new MA130301GT catalogue presented in this paper is the result of: (1) overall merger of MA115225GT and MA75919T; (2) 2042 additional craters found using Shen–Castan based CDA from the previous work and 1/128° MOLA data; and (3) 3129 additional craters found using CDA for optical images from the previous work and selected regions of 1/256° MDIM, 1/256° THEMIS-DIR, and 1/256° MOC datasets. All craters from MA130301GT are manually aligned with all used datasets. For all the craters that originate from the used catalogues (Barlow, Rodionova, Boyce, Kuzmin, Stepinski) we integrated all the attributes available in these catalogues. With such an approach MA130301GT provides everything that was included in these catalogues, plus: (1) the correlation between various morphological descriptors from used catalogues; (2) the correlation between manually assigned attributes and automated depth/diameter measurements from MA75919T and our CDA; (3) surface dating which has been improved in resolution globally; (4) average errors and their standard deviations for manually and automatically assigned attributes such as position coordinates, diameter, depth/diameter ratio, etc.; and (5) positional accuracy of features in the used datasets according to the defined coordinate system referred to as MDIM 2.1, which incorporates 1232 globally distributed ground control points, while our catalogue contains 130 301 cross-references between each of the used datasets. Global completeness of MA130301GT is up to ∼D≥2 km (it contains 85 783 such craters, while the smallest D is 0.924 km). This is a considerable improvement in comparison with the completeness of the Rodionova (∼10 km), Barlow (∼5 km) and Stepinski (∼3 km) catalogues. An accompanying result to the new catalogue is a contribution to the evaluation of CDAs—the following methods have been developed: (1) a new context-aware method for the advanced automated registration of craters with GT catalogues; (2) a new method for manual registration of newly found craters into GT catalogues; and (3) additional new accompanying methods for objective evaluation of CDAs using different datasets including optical images.

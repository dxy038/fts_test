We propose an adaptive interpolation method for digital images. This new algorithm is simple and yet efficient in enlarging images. First, the edge orientation in an image is detected, and then this information is used to determine suitable weights for neighboring pixels when interpolating the current pixel. The proposed algorithm obtains better results in both subjective and objective quality measurements over existing methods.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ultrasound treatment (5, 15, 30 and 45 min) on water vapor permeability (WVP), tensile strength (TS) and elongation percentage at break (E%) of methylcellulose films. Results showed the significant effect of ultrasound treatment on water vapor barrier and mechanical properties of films. According to the obtained results, increasing of ultrasound exposure time caused water vapor permeability of films to decrease. The lowest WVP was obtained at 45 min treatment, also the highest TS and E% was observed at 5 and 45 min treated samples.

Background and Objective: Recent research suggests that a proportion of women may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childbirth. This study aimed to test relationship between cesarean section and vaginal delivery with PTSD after childbirth in Bushehr.

Materials and Methods: This study was an analytic cross-sectional one. Participants were recruited from post-partum women who attended health medical centers in Bushehr (n = 400) and for women with traumatic delivery completed posttraumatic symptoms scale-I (PSS-I) and reproductive questionnaire. Data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression.

Results: Women with PTSD had higher odds ratio for emergency cesarean section (Odds ratio = 3.55, CI=1.69-8.07) and insufficiency income (Odds ratio=4.50, CI=1.71-11.84). Duration of labor lower than 3 hours (Odds ratio=0.15, CI=0.04-0.55) and higher education level (Odds ratio=0.15, CI=0.04-8.58) were associated with significantly decreased risk for PTSD. 

Conclusion: Interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of PTSD after childbirth needs further research but it seems that consultation about decreased cesarean section during prenatal care is useful.

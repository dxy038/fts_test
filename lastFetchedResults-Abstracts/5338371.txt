This paper reviews an approach for the automatic orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)signals classification for the cognitive radio applied to the standard IEEE 802.11 (the WiFi: Wireless Fidelity system) identification. Detected transmissions are classified as single-carrier or multi-carrier. In the case of multi-carrier transmission, different parameters may be used to ensure the identification objective. In this paper, we will discuss the pilot parameter. First of all, we present the pilot induced cyclostationarity (PIC) algorithm to identify automatically the WiFi system. In the second part, we evaluate its performance by calculating the probability of correct classification and we make a comparison with other approaches presented in the literature.

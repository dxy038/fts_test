In most applications, the antennas with maximum peak values of the radiating pulse in a certain direction are demanded. In order to meet this demand, the antenna shapes are optimized by the conjugate gradient method. The time-domain radiating characteristics of the dipole antennas are analyzed by the time stepping method. The objective functions used in the optimization procedure are the peak values of the radiating pulse in the front direction of the antenna, the variables to be optimized are the included angles of the V-dipoles and the arm radii of the arc-curved dipoles, and the included angles between the arm radii and the axes.

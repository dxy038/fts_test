Trustable information delivering and propagation is important for the peers in semantic web. In this paper, we present a semantics based semantic trust score computation method. Trustable semantics of information is represented through trust ontology. Entire trust is measured by a combined trust score from both subjective and objective sides of information. The objective side of trust is semantic trust of information, and the subjective side is trust relationship between peers. Semantic trust of information is computed from three aspects: frequency of known feature words, context location of known feature words and the ontology location of known feature words. And trust relationship is based on the historical interactions between peers. Then we proposed an information propagation mechanism in semantic web. Stimulations and analyses show that the semantic trust of information can be computed and propagated effectively.

In this paper, we propose the directional neighborhood distance and all-directional neighborhood distance (ADND) to measure the gray value variation between pixels in specific and all direction. The all-directional neighborhood distance is used to fuse multi-source images, and our experiments show that the proposed fusion method is effective in term of some objective evaluation indexes, such as spatial frequency, average gradient, etc.

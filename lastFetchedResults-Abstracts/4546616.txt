The objective of this work is to provide a set of most significant content descriptive feature parameters to identify and classify the kidney disorders with ultrasound scan. The ultrasound images are initially pre-processed to preserve the pixels of interest prior to feature extraction. In total 28 features are extracted, the analysis of features value shows that 13 features are highly significant in discrimination. This resultant feature vector is used to train the multilayer back propagation network. The network is tested with the unknown samples. The outcome of multi-layer back propagation network is verified with medical experts and this confirms classification efficiency of 90.47%, 86.66%, and 85.71% for the classes considered respectively. The study shows that feature extraction after pre-processing followed by ANN based classification significantly enhance objective diagnosis and provides the possibility of developing computer-aided diagnosis system

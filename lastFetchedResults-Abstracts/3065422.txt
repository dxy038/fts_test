In this paper, a model reference adaptive controller design based on hyperstability theory is considered for the uncertain nonlinear system with the so-called sector-like bounded nonlinear inputs, which is subjected to the norm-bounded system parameter variation, unmodelling error, and external disturbance uncertainties. In the proposed adaptive control scheme, the asymptotical tracking objective of system output for the desired output can be achieved and the bounded conditions of all the signals in the controlled system can be ensured. Finally, some computer simulation results are given to illustrate the performance of the proposed adaptive control system.

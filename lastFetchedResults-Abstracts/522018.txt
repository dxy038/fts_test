Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) for parents of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: Sixty families who had at least one child with clinically diagnosed ADHD aged between 6 to12 years were recruited from the consecutive referrals to a child and adolescent psychiatric clinic. Families were randomly assigned to the intervention group (who participated in an 8- week- group Triple P, N=30) and a control group (N=30). Parents completed the battery of self-report questionnaires of Triple P at the beginning and after the 8th session. Results: There were no significant differences in pre intervention measures between the two groups. Comparing the pre and post intervention data, the Triple P group was associated with significantly lower levels of dysfunctional parenting (P=0.001) and greater parental competence (P=0.001) than the control group. The parents in the Triple P group had significant improvement on measures of depression, anxiety and stress, in comparison with the control group (P=0.001). This study did not follow the long term effect which marks its limitation. Conclusion: The Triple P program can be recommended for parents of children with ADHD to improve their parenting abilities.

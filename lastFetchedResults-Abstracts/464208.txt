OBJECTIVE: With the use of a university- and community hospital-based faculty, we attempted to determine at what performance level remediation would be recommended.
STUDY DESIGN: The Committee on In-Training Examinations for Residents in Obstetrics and Gynecology Task Force on Standard-Based Scoring sent the 1991 examination to 16 university- and 12 community hospital-based faculty members. Given a standardized definition of a “borderline third-year resident,” each faculty scored each item on the examination on whether that hypothetic resident would or would not correctly answer the item.
RESULTS: The mean expectation of correct responses on the 397-item test was 236 (59%). This was identical to the score obtained if 2 SDs were subtracted from the actual mean for all third-year residents taking the examination. University- and community hospital-based faculty members had generally similar expectations of this defined resident.
CONCLUSION: Although poor examination results should not be recommended as the sole determinant for promotion, it appears that 2 SDs below the mean may be an appropriate score below which remediation could be recommended.

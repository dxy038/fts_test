with regard to the world population explosion and conflicting ideas between increasing
demands and earth limited resources, sustainable development is merely achieved with
agricultural sustainable planning for preserving water and soil resources. Therefore a
system should be designed for effective controlling and directing resources to achieve
the highest profit and productivity the least cost. Math planning techniques using
computer models are effective ways for solving present issues in soils and water
resources management. Linear programming, goal programming and multi objective
optimization are some examples of mathematical programming. The aim of present
study is to introduce the main applied models and mathematical programming. More
over the application of linear programming in mathematical programming soil and
water source management solving multi objective problems and their complex
relationship are investigated. ADBASE software is used in these models good points of
this software is to minimize the subjectivity of experts and exchanging the parameters.
Using the finding of these techniques helps decision makers and policy makers to
choose the best way to solve problems and to show the maximum profit, minimum cost
of the resources.

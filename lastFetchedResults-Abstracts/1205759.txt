The main objective of this paper was to synthesize luminescent thermotropic liquid crystalline polyazomethines containing chromophoric mesogen, which design has been addressed to optoelectronic materials. The investigation of the thermotropic behavior by three complementary methods of analyses, i.e. polarized optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and wide angle X-ray diffraction, indicated a nematic mesophase for the polymers containing oxadiazole units, either alternating or random ones. A mesomorphic state maintaining the degree of order of the semicrystalline state while being viscous fluid was evidenced too. The photoluminescence spectra recorded for both polymer solutions and films exhibited a blue light emission. These results point to the possibility of obtaining monodomain or multidomain ordered thin films without grain boundaries showing good mechanical and luminescent properties.

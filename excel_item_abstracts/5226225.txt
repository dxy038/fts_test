The query-based on the result is less relevant documents results. In this study, a query has been improved in order to retrieve more relevant documents across language boundaries, a mechanism for query translation with semantic which is applied on as semantic query (SQ). Therefore, this study is conducted with the purposes to investigate semantic approach against the queries and vice versa. Furthermore, it is also conducted to investigate the performance query based on total retrieve and relevant. The retrieval however, included the irrelevant documents because of the translation polysemy. Results from the experiments suggest that semantic approach is most important process in cross language information retrieval (CLIR). It also found that semantic approach contributes to better performance in retrieving more relevant and related Quran document results.

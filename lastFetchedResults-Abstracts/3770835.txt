The objective of this work is to establish the dependence of characteristics of the fiber optics gyrocompass with respect to the parameters of the superluminescent emission source based on doped optical fiber with rare earth elements, Superluminescent fiber source (SFS), argument the pumping rate election of the SFS to obtain characteristics limits of the fiber optic gyroscope sensibility.

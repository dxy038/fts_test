In this paper we provide a duality theory for multiobjective optimization problems with convex
objective functions and finitely many D.C. constraints. In order to do this, we study first the duality
for a scalar convex optimization problem with inequality constraints defined by extended real-valued
convex functions. For a family of multiobjective problems associated to the initial one we determine
then, by means of the scalar duality results, their multiobjective dual problems. Finally, we consider
as a special case the duality for the convex multiobjective optimization problem with convex
constraints.

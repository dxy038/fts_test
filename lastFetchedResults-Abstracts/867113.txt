In this paper, a shape-based block layout (SBL) approach for solving facility layout problem with unequal-areas and fixed-shapes is presented. The SBL approach employs hybrid genetic algorithm to find good solution. The existing algorithms for the problem of assigning positions to unequal-area and fixed or approximated shape departments within a given building area can produce solutions with some drawbacks, which require extensive manual revision to create practical layouts and produce irregular building shapes and too much unusable spaces. The objective function of SBL approach minimizes total material handling cost and maximizes space utilization. Experimental results show that the SBL approach is able to improve solution and it can create more practical layout than that of existing approaches.

In order to overcome some disadvantages of the available methods, a newly named analytical method is presented here. This method named two stage relative efficiency method, which is realized from data envelopment analysis (DEA), evaluates managerial performance by eliminating the influence of existing conditions. Empirical results show that the method presented here can avoid penalizing good managers who manage within an unfavorable existing condition as well as avoid rewarding poor managers who manage in a favorable existing condition. The newly named analytical method is an equitable and objective measuring method for efficiency.

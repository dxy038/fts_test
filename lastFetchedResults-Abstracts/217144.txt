Objectivity, reliability and validity of examinations in psychiatry have always been one of the major concerns of experts in this discipline. Recently, objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) for its unique approach and by providing the requirements of psychiatric examinations has been a topic of interest. In Iran, an OSCE has been replaced the individual patient assessment (IPA) for examination of the National Board of Psychiatry. Although it is better to provide psychiatry OSCE in an extended time frame, in some cases this examination should be executed in a short period of time. For executing OSCE in psychiatry, especially if it should be performed in a short time, it requires addressing various points. In this article, based upon the previous experiences, we offer a standard format for establishing a practical, reliable and measurable OSCE in psychiatry in three days.

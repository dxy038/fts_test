An improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm based on layered objective is given. Two improvements on the traditional non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm are proposed that are new layer method (layered target) and the new selection mechanism (cycle through the first 1/2 layer according to the hierarchy). The simulation results show that the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm based on layered target can effectively speed up the convergence rate of population.

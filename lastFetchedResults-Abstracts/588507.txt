abstraction that is difficult to learn. Therefore, this is necessary for learners' utmost good faith to their ability to solve problems in Physics.
Objective: This study aims to probe the effectiveness of searching model on students' self-esteem beliefs in solving Physics problems. 
Method:  This study is quasi-experimental design of pretest-posttest with two control groups. The statistic society includes all the basic high school male students of Fariman town in Khorasan Razavi province, in the academic of year 2011-2012. 
Results: Paired t-test results on the effectiveness of the pattern on the search showed that the rate of self-efficacy scores between the pretest and posttest in experimental group is significantly different from (t= -4.44, p < 0/001), so knowledge of self-efficacy scores of experimental group and the other components of the test scores were higher in pre-test.
 Conclusion: Given the above findings, we conclude that the search pattern, self-esteem of students in their ability to solve problems in Physics teaching, was increased. Therefore, employing this model in teaching high school students is recommended

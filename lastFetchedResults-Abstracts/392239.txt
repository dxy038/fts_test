Objective: The Jet Stream Olfactometer, a modification by the T&T olfactometer, has been recently developed and is now commercially available. This Jet Stream Olfactometer can routinely measure the unilateral sense of smell. Clinical usefulness of the Jet Stream Olfactometer was evaluated. Methods: Twenty-three patients with sinus-related symptoms were examined. Unilateral olfactory acuity was examined using the Jet Stream Olfactometer and compared it with the anatomy of the olfactory cleft by computed tomographic (CT) scans. Results: In 13 of the 23 patients examined the right olfactory threshold was similar to that of the left. Of these 13, in seven patients there was transport damage of the odorants and in the other six there was sensorineural damage. Ten patients showed an apparent difference between the right and left smell thresholds. Anosmia in seven of these ten patients was due to a conductive olfactory disturbance resulting from rhinosinusitis, whereas sensorineural damage was recognized in the other three patients. The difference in the detection threshold between the right and left nasal cavities was well correlated to that of the opacity between the right and left olfactory clefts. Conclusion: Jet Stream Olfactometer provides a convenient and reliable means for assessing the ability of unilateral smell.

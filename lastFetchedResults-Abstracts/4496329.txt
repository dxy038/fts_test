This paper introduces a new industry alliance of ASEM merchant foundries, customers, EDA vendors, and suppliers. The objective of this Alliance is to establish an interface specification (guide) and an information model for the bidirectional exchange of electronic design data and information between customers and foundries. The goal of this ARPA funded effort is to reduce the barriers in exchanging design and component data/information between customers and foundries, thus minimizing cost and maximizing efficiency in the design-to-manufacture of ASEMs

The presence of heavy metals in aqueous waste streams has become a problem due to its harmful effects on human health and to the fauna and flora of receiving water bodies. Metal immobilization through adsorption and precipitation is considered as a common mechanism to decrease the hazards of heavy metal. The objective of this study is to assess the uptake of, Cd2+ from aqueous solution by nanocrystalline tri-calcium phosphate (TCP). The study also investigates the effects of parameters such as initial concentration ion, adsorbent mass, temperature, and pH. According to the experimental results, increase in initial concentration ion, temperature and pH resulted in increase in adsorption capacity, Increasing mass adsorbent decreased the adsorption of Cd2+ by nanocrystalline TCP. Various thermodynamic parameters, such as ?G°, ?H° and ?S° have been calculated. The thermodynamics of all ions onto nano-TCP system indicates spontaneous and endothermic nature of the process.

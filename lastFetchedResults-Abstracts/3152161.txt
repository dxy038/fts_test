The objective of this empirical study is to review current status of communication and IT practices in rural areas. In particular, the study explores the local peopleÂ´s expectation and readiness to embrace new technology like WiMAX in rural areas. Mae Hong Son, one of very rural areas in Northern Thailand is chosen as a case study. The initial survey involves a number of local people in four rural areas using stratified sampling technique. The results indicate that (a) the communities have increased an awareness of IT adoption, in particular broadband and long distance internet, to improve education, knowledge, economy, and overall quality of life; (b) a clear lack of computer and hardware, infrastructure, budget for human development are the major problems preventing people to access to the internet; (c) IT adoption creates intangible values including human development, learning, and training skills. On the other hand, the communities also demonstrate some disadvantages caused by IT adoption. Finally, this empirical study provides a foundation to further research on IT adoption in rural areas in terms of socio-economic impacts.

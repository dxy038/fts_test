Highly accelerated life testing (HALT) was performed on embedded planar capacitors by subjecting these devices to elevated temperature and voltage aging conditions. The dielectric material of these capacitors was a nanocomposite of epoxy and BaTiO<sub>3</sub>. The objective of HALT was to model the time-to-failure as a function of temperature and voltage using the Prokopowicz model. This involved computing the constants of the Prokopowicz model, voltage exponent (<i>n</i>), and activation energy (<i>Ea</i>) for a nanocomposite of epoxy and BaTiO<sub>3</sub>. The results of HALT can be used for the qualification of embedded planar capacitors and for further improvement in the material and the manufacturing processes of these capacitors.

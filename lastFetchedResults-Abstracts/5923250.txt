The objective of this paper is to give an overview of how it is possible to integrate different heterogeneous internet systems without losing the consistency of the data involved. The individual technologies used to make the integration are not new but to our knowledge it is the first time the description of these technologies are presented together in order to give an overview of how it is possible to integrate different internet systems with so called relaxed ACID properties by using SOA services. In central databases the consistency and reliability of data is normally implemented by using the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) properties of a DBMS (Data Base Management System). This is normally not possible in heterogeneous distributed databases where the availability of data also has to be optimized. Therefore, we will in this paper use relaxed ACID properties across different locations. The objective of designing relaxed ACID properties across different database locations is to give the users a view of the data that may be inconsistent across different locations but in practice functions as if the traditional ACID properties were implemented. That is the users can trust the data they use. In this paper, we will use the integration of the e-commerce systems of the suppliers with the ERP systems of the customers as an example. However, the integration architecture described in this paper may for example also be used for integrating hospital systems, banking systems, airline systems, logistic systems etc.

Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the sleep pattern changes across the menstrual cycle in patients with premenstrual syndrome. Study design: This prospective study was conducted in a university-based premenstrual syndrome clinic. The patients were selected on the basis of the comprehensive interview and visual linear analog scale. Well-matched control subjects were also selected. All the subjects underwent two consecutive sleep pattern recordings during each of three different menstrual phases in 1 month. Nine sleep parameters were recorded. Results: Three patients and six controls completed the study. No cycle-related fluctuation in any parameter was noted in either the patients or the controls. No significant differences in sleep pattern were noted in the patients when compared with the controls during the same phase of the menstrual cycle. Conclusion: Abnormal sleep pattern in relation to premenstrual syndrome or phases of the menstrual cycle was not demonstrated in this preliminary study.

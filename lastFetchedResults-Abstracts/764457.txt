The objective of current study was to survey the effective factors of internet- based evaluation of faculty members done by the students. For this purpose, evaluation results of all faculty members of Islamic Azad University of Khoy in two sequential terms, 2009-2010 , with their demographic variables, were gathered. Data were analyzed using independent samples T- test, Pearson correlation test, analysis of variance and multiple regression. The results showed that there were no significant statistical differences in evaluation scores in terms of sexuality, type of employment and type of educational certificate. But there was a significant difference in the rate of evaluation scores among different faculties. The scores of techno-engineering and basic sciences faculties were lower than the scores of humanistic sciences, agriculture, and nursing faculties. The results of regression showed that personal variables can significantly predict evaluation scores. Finally results revealed that there was a positive and significant relation between evaluation scores of faculty members in two sequential terms.

Background: Total system design (TSD) factors are design factors, which have impact on overall performance of the power plants in context of total human engineering or macroergonomic. The evaluation of the impact of TSD factors was the main goal of this study. The main objective was human factors engineering on human performance in a power plant. 
Methods: The systems being studied are the control rooms and maintenance departments of a 2000 MW thermal power plant in IRAN. By non-parametric correlation analysis and Kruskal-Wallis test of means, we can achieve between TSD factors and human performance.
Results: The selected TSD factors are related to procedures, work assessment, teamwork, self-organization, information exchange and communication. In a way we can say that various factors influence on human performance in the power plant is TSD factors such as organizational and safety procedures, teamwork, self-organization, job design and information exchange. 
Conclusion: The best way to increase human performance is TSD factors must be considered, designed and tested concurrently with the engineering factors at the design phase of the system developmental cycle.

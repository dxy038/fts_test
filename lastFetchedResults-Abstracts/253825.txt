Chemical fungicides that are related with resistant
strains develop negative effects on human health and
environment. Propolis is a resinous substance collected
by bees with positive effects on human health and
inhibitory activity against Alternaria alternata. Caffeic
acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a component of the
propolis. The objective of this experiment was to test
the effect of CAPE on fungi infecting tomato fruit
using as a model the pathosystem A. alternata-tomato.
CAPE was chemically synthesized in our laboratory
and analysed with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Different concentrations (0, 16, 32, 48, 64,
80, 90 and 100 lm) of CAPE were tested on A. alternata
growing in vitro. For the in vivo experiment, red
ripe tomato fruit was inoculated with A. alternata and
untreated or treated with 1, 50 and 100 lm of CAPE.
After that, the fruit was stored at 25 C for up to
20 days. Colony size (CS) was recorded in vitro. In
tomato fruits, the severity of infection (SI), respiration
rate (RR), ethylene production (EP), pH, total soluble
solids (TSS), weight loss (WL) and titratable acidity
(TA) were evaluated during the storage time. CAPE
melting point and spectral data probed to be the right
molecule. In vitro, 64 and 100 lm of CAPE reduced
CS by 30%. In vivo, 50 and 100 lm of CAPE reduced
SI higher than the fungicide Captan  with no effects
on RR, EP, WL, pH, TSS and TA. It was concluded
that CAPE controls A. alternata infection better than
a commercial fungicide without negative effects on
tomato fruit ripening and fruit quality.

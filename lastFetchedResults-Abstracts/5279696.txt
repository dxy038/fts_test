Parallel and distributed computing systems offer the promise of a quantum leap in the computing power that can be brought to bear on many important problems. The potential for distributed processing exists whenever there are several computers interconnected in some fashion so that a program or procedure running on one machine can transfer control to a procedure running on another. In such an environment we wish to assign optimally the modules of a program to specific processors. The main objective in optimizing is twofold, minimizing the running time of the program and improving the efficiency of the algorithm. Our main task in this work is to develop an environment that allows easy parallelization of the existing sequential algorithms, in which the potential parallelism fits easily into the sequential algorithm. This paper discusses techniques to parallelize advanced search heuristics (Areibi and Vannelli, 1994) used to solve the circuit partitioning problem

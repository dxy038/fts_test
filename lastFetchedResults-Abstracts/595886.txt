Results: In our investigation female patients prevail (57%), age from 25 to 45 years old with medium difficult clinical picture (71,55%). Chi-square test showed significant dependence between sex and clinical status of patient (p<0,05), dyspnea and clinical status of patient (p<0,05), while statistical significance was nor proved related to comorbid-ity (p>0,05), cough (p>0,05), radiological confirmed pneumonia (p>0,05), number of prehospital days of diseases (p>0,05) and length of hospital care (p>0,05). Significant impact on clinical status of patients is found related to age (p<0,05), in a way that every year of age increase risk in 2,9% for more severe disease.

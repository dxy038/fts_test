OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the expression of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β and interleukin-6) by fetal membranes in response to infection in vivo and to endotoxin in organ culture.
Study design: Amniochorionic membranes were collected from infected and uninfected women and analyzed for cytokine messenger ribonucleic acid and protein. Normal membranes were cultured and exposed to endotoxin. Messenger ribonucleic acid expression was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Cellular localization of messenger ribonucleic acid and protein was determined by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical evaluation, respectively.
RESULSTS: Messenger ribonucleic acid for interleukin-1β appeared to be increased in infected or endotoxin-stimulated amniochorionic membranes, whereas interleukin-6 messenger ribonucleic acid was only observed in infected membranes or after endotoxin stimulation. Interleukin-1β messenger ribonucleic acid was localized exclusively to chorionic cells, whereas protein was obsreved in both chorion and amnion. Interleukin-6 messenger ribonucleic acid and protein were produced in both amniotic and chorionic cells.
CONCLUSION: Amniochorionic membranes are a site of inflammatory cytokine production. These findings may have significance in preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes.

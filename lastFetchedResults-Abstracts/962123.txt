In this study, we report and compare two methods for fabricating patterns of streptavidin protein using soft litography microprinting technique
(mCP) and laser-based method termed ‘matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation direct write’ (MAPLE DW). The mCP approach is a parallel
deposition technique capable of X depositions per stamper. The technique is limited in more sophisticated multicomponent deposition by the size
of patterns that can be produced and the features obtained during the transfer process. The computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing
(CAD/CAM) ability of MAPLE DWovercomes the limitations of the mCP approach. (i)We establish the science and engineering principles behind
the effective transfer of microarrays and (ii) we explore issues regarding the direct immobilization, morphology and function of the deposited
protein at the interface with an aqueous environment and in the precision of controlled ligand-receptor reactions. In summary, our objective was to
develop simple, robust microfabrication techniques for the construction of model 2D and 3D bioscaffolds to be used in fundamental bioengineering
studies.

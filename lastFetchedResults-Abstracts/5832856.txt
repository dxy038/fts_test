This paper presents an optimization methodology for placement of switches in medium-voltage loop distribution networks. The primary objective is to minimize the total cost with consideration of achieving high distribution reliability levels. In this paper, four possible states are considered and discussed, and the improved genetic algorithm is adopted to determine the optimal number and locations of sectionalizing switches and interconnection switches. The feasibility and superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by application to main feeder F1 and F2 among RBTS-BUS 5 system.

The objective of this paper is to analyze the influence that the ground wires and soil and skin effects have on the R and L transmission line parameters. Initially a theoretical analysis of the influence which the ground wires have on the R and L parameters is presented. Some results obtained of a hypothetical line with frequency constant parameters and of a line with variable parameters are presented. The individual influence of the skin and ground effects on the R and L parameters is analyzed

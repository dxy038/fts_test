The study aimed at a critical assessment of the environmentalism components introduced in the civil
engineering curriculum in India polytechnic colleges (state of Tamilnadu) and associate degree level Technical Institutions
in Iran .The objective of study was to compare technical education curriculum in civil engineering with respect to
environmentalism. Both qualitative and quantitative techniques were used as content analysis method. Qualitative
analysis was carried out to compare the curriculum with respect to environmentalism components. Study samples are
drawn from the educational and academic institutions in India and Iran. For the purpose of quantitative analysis, ttest,
F-test, and factor analysis were used. To establish reliability of the tools, Cronbach Coefficient of Alpha was
calculated. Then quantitative analysis was carried out to test the hypotheses formulated. The results revealed that
there were significant differences in total environmental subjects in the curriculum of civil engineering in terms of
techniques and technologies. These are examples of different practices in case of academic institutions of Iran: Soil
pollution and noise pollution are very much neglected. Contents on ISO standards related to environmentalism are
missing. No specific strategy has been laid down to teach environmentalism in technical education. Content is mostly
towards classroom, and no emphasis on practical experience, fielding visit/industrial visits.

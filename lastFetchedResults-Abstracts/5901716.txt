This is a preliminary work to extend SQL to support user privacy in social networks. The proposal is to extend the data definition and data manipulation languages to capture privacy-preserved mandatory and discretionary access controls, respectively. Here, we focus on common user privacy requirements, such as purpose, generalization, and retention, used by social networks desiring to support privacy. Hence, each user can discretionarily control the set of privileges over the view representing their profile. We plan to support the extended language with underlying catalogues, algorithms, and prototypes. The objective is to develop a low-cost mechanism to preserve privacy in databases,with applications in social networks, e-health, e-business, e-government, etc.

Background and Objective: In traditional medicine, the shallot plant is recognized as an effective food for the amplification of male sexual ability. This study was performed in order to find an available, effective and lowrisk treatment for fertility problems due to sperm production disorders.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 60 adult male mice with an average weight of 23&Â±1 grams were selected and randomly divided into 5 equal groups, including a control group, a sham group and 3 experimental groups. The experimental groups received 0.5 ml hydroalcoholic extract of shallot three different doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg/day hydroalcoholic extract of shallot every other day resulting in a total of 13 injections. The sham group received the same volume of normal saline and the control group did not receive anything. After removing the testicles, data was collected on testicular mass, germ cell numbers, external and internal diameter of tubules and germinal layer area and density. The data was evaluated with oneway ANOVA variance analysis and Tukey and Dunnett tests.

Results: Significantly increased spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, spermatids and internal and external diameters of tubules and germinal layer area were seen in experimental groups compared with controls. Furthermore comparison of testis weight ratio between the third experimental group and controls and comparison of the internal diameter of tubules among the first and third experimental groups showed a significant increase.

Conclusion: The results showed that hydroalcoholic shallot extract increases the number of germ cells in mice testes and helps amplify the sexual ability of male mice.

Problem statement: This study describes that the Next Generation of Networks (NGN) communication will supports multiple technologies, handles the mobility of end users to move through heterogeneous access networks, with ability to connect to different networks. Where the Internet Engineer Task Force maintain (IETF) the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) to handles the mobility of networks (NEMO), to provide wide band and more scalable network services. One of the MIPv6 built-in features is Route Optimization (RO) to solve the inefficient route problem. Conclusion/Recommendations: The main objective of this article is to survey, classify and make a compression between the available schemes for route optimization over the last years depends on the basic criteria generated from the published articles within different network topology. This article presents the problem of suboptimal route which is further increased with increasing of nesting levels and there is no such one scheme is perfect for all network environments.

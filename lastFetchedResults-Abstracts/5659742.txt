(1) Background, Motivation and Objective: Academic study of Cloud Computing within Saudi Arabia is an emerging research field. Saudi Arabia represents the largest economy in the Arabian Gulf region. This positions it as a potential market of cloud computing technologies. Adoption of new innovations should be preceded by analysis of the added value, challenges and adequacy from technological, organizational and environmental perspectives. (2) Statement of Contribution/Method: This cross-sectional exploratory empirical research is based on Technology, Organization and Environment model targeting higher education institutions. In this study, the factors that influence the adoption by higher education institutions were analyzed and tested using Partial Least Square. (3) Results, Discussion and Conclusions: Three factors were found significant in this context. Relative Advantage, Data Privacy and Complexity are the most significant factors. The model explained 43% of the total adoption measure variation. Significant differences in the areas of cloud computing compatibility, complexity, vendor lock-in and peer pressure between large and small institutions were revealed. Items for future cloud computing research were explored through open-ended questions. Adoption of cloud services by higher education institutions has been started. It was found that the adoption rate among large universities is higher than small higher education institutions. Improving the network and Internet Infrastructure in Saudi Arabia at an affordable cost is a pre-requisite for cloud computing adoption. Cloud service provider should address the privacy and complexity concerns raised by non-adopters. Future information systems that are potential for hosting in cloud were prioritized.

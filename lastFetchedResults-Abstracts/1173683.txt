Phase equilibrium in binary ethanol mixtures found in alcoholic beverage production has been analyzed using a cubic equation of state (EoS) and suitable mixing and combining rules. The main objective of the study is the accurate modeling of the congener concentration in the vapor phase (substances different from ethanol), considered to be an important enological parameter in the alcohol industry. The Peng–Robinson (PR) equation of state has been used and the Wong–Sandler (WS) mixing rules, that include a model for the excess Gibbs free energy, have been incorporated into the equation of state constants. In the Wong–Sandler mixing rules the van Laar (VL) model for the excess Gibbs energy has been used. This combination of equations of state, mixing rules and combining rules are commonly applied to high pressure phase equilibrium and have not yet been treated in a systematic way to complex low pressure ethanol mixtures as done in this work. Nine binary ethanol + congener mixtures have been considered for analysis. Comparison with available literature data is done and the accuracy of the calculations is discussed, concluding that the model used is accurate enough for engineering applications.

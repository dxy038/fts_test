Istomina (2011) presented a dual-view approach using Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) onboard ENVISAT for Arctic AOD retrieval. In this paper, some improvements have been done. One improvement is that we use more physical-based dual-view estimation without assumption. Another improvement is to include the more appropriate snow Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) ratio estimation from pure snow BRDF model given by Kokhanovsky et al (2005) together with Snow Cover Fraction (SFC), in order to get more appropriate surface properties during retrieval. Simple compare between IstominaÂ´s algorithm and the algorithm described in the paper show the approach described in the paper also provides reasonable results without correction from Raditive Transfer Model (RTM) like SCIATRAN.

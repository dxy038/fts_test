A bidirectional selection cooperation approach based on Multi-Agent is presented, in which some parameters, such as the ability value, communication costs and so on, are introduced into the classical contract net protocol. More importantly, the bidirectional selection mechanism between assign task agent and perform task agent is introduced into collaboration for the first time. These parameters reduce the communication consumption and balance the resource load among all Agents. The bidirectional selection cooperation increases cooperation efficiency and ensures the reliability and correctness of the whole Multi-Agent system. At last, taking detonator production schedule as an example, it proves that the bidirectional selection cooperation approach prolongs the system lifetime, improves the system load and increases the accomplished tasks in unit time.

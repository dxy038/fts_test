Purpose: To evaluate the beneficial effects of rifampin for the treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). 
Methods: In this non-randomized clinical trial, 39 patients with acute CSCR ( < 2 weeks) were enrolled. Initially, complete visual examinations including determination of best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) using Snellen chart; anterior and posterior segment examination was performed. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and ocular coherence tomography (OCT) were also performed to confirm the diagnosis. Twenty-three patients were treated with 600 mg rifampin per day for a maximum of 4-6 weeks (treatment group) and 17 patients did not receive any treatment (control group). The patients were examined post treatment at weeks 2, 4 & 6. At each follow-up examination BCVA and fundoscopy were performed. If no macular edema was observed in fundOscopy, OCT was performed; otherwise OCT was performed at the end of 4th-6th week. Primary objective was reduction in macular thickness (MT) and secondary objective was the BSCVA.
Results: Mean age of patients was 38.5±6.7 years; 37.7±6.2 years in the treatment group and 39.7?7.3 years in the control group (P > 0.05). 76.9% of patients were male. Mean MT reduced from 339.9±44.36 µm at the beginning of treatment to 297.4±29.09 µm at the final visit (12.58% reduction, P < 0.001). In the control group, the figures were 310.06±20.31 and 296.71±17.22 µm, respectively (4.3% reduction, (P < 0.003). The treatment group demonstrated more reduction in MT (P < 0.018). Mean BSCVA was 0.2±0.18 and 0.6±0.34 SV before and after treatment respectively (P < 0.0001) in the treatment group and 0.2±0.1 and 0.37±0.35 SV, respectively (P < 0.024) in the control group. The difference in BSCVA between the two groups was significant (P=0.055). Macula was dry in 45.5% of the treatment group and 29.4% of the control group at the end of study (OR=2 CI95%, 0.52-7.6, P=0.307). All the patients with dry macula at the end of study in the treatment group were followed for 9 months and no recurrence of the lesion was found. 
Conclusion: Rifampin has beneficial effects in the treatment of acute CSCR. These early findings suggest a novel treatment of CSCR and warranted further study.

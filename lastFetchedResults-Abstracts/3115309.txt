Ever since computers and their software were used as essential components in critical systems, the dependability of computer-based systems has been a concern. Dependability of software, a major concern in many computer applications, can be improved through several means. But systematic approaches for its evaluation, which is the prerequisite for dependability control and improvement, do not exist. Software dependability evaluation is an urgent problem to be solved. Rough set theory is an effective tool in dealing with vague and uncertain information. A new comprehensive evaluation model with combinational weight based on rough set theory is proposed in this paper. Relatively reasonable weight is obtained by combining expertpsilas judgment and objective data, which effectively avoids subjectivity of weighing coefficient in fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model. Application result verifies the feasibility and validity of the improved comprehensive evaluation model proposed.

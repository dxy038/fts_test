The basic objective of this paper is to analyze the concept of wavelet based algorithms for image compression using different parameter. All algorithms are based on still images, The algorithm involved in the comparative analysis is Wavelet Difference Reduction (WDR), Spatial orientation tree wavelet (STW), Embedded zero tree wavelet (EZW) and modified Set Partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT). These algorithms are more effective and deliver a better feature in the image. In compression, wavelets transform have shown a good elasticity to a large amount of data, while being of realistic complexity. These techniques are used in many image processing applications. The techniques are compared by using the performance parameters peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) &amp; mean square error (MSE).

The objective of this thematic study is to evaluate the potential of SPOT5 various imaging modes for the extraction of planimetric features, according to mapping requirements of developed and developing countries. The suitability of HRG images has been analyzed in comparison with IGN reference database in France and in view to generate or update tomomaps over the Ouagadougou site in Burkina Faso. 2.5 m colour images show the best cartographic potential, but 2.5 m Black&amp;White or 5 m Colour images may turn to be sufficient for some cartographic applications, especially in sparsely populated areas. SPOT5 clearly appears as a wonderful tool for mapping, allowing the production of Geographic Information with a content and a geometric accuracy that are compliant with 1:25,000 tomomap standards. Hundred thousand Sqkm can be covered within short time delays and at a reasonable price per Sqkm, when compared with metric satellites.

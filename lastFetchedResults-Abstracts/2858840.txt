This Document shows the control LQR (Linear quadratic Regulator) PI (Proportional Integral)Vectorial design, which is developed to control the dynamic of a remote operated underwater vehicle ROV, to allow that the vehicle follow a horizontal trajectory autonomously . The results are showed through simulations of following the trajectory of ROV obtaining satisfactory results and complying with the objective to control the dynamic while follow a trajectory.

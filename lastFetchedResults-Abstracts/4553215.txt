This paper deals with the modeling and the simulation of a French Armored Personal Carrier (APC) called DPE 6times6 (6 driven wheels Electric Propulsion Demonstrator). The objective is here to design a simulation focused on power interactions inside the system in order to allow the study of energy management and the control of the different subsystems. The DPE 6times6 architecture is quite complex and the goal is reached using Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR). This paper presents the DPE 6times6, its EMR, and the experimental validation.

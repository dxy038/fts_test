In this paper an accurate method is presented for determining of the device sizes in a RF circuit based on genetic algorithm (GA). HSPICE RF simulation is used for evaluating of the fitness of the circuit specifications per every iteration of the GA. Also an example for a LNA is presented for evaluating of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) as a method of multi objective genetic algorithm optimization. Simulation results confirm efficiency of the GA for determining of the devices sizes and optimization in a RF circuit.

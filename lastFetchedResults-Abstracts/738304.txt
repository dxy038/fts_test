Objective
The present review examines efficacious psycho-behavioral interventions in preventing weight gains or reducing weight among US multiethnic and minority adults as few studies were conducted to review such interventions to date.
Methods

Data were examined from 24 controlled intervention studies, representing 23 programs and involving 13,326 adults. Studies were identified through manual and online search of databases that include MEDLINE, Academic Search Premier, ERIC, PsycARTICLES, SPORTDiscus, and CINAHL Plus.
Results

Whereas one-component (n = 5, d = 0.08, 90% CI = − 0.04, 0.35) and two-component interventions (n = 13, d = 0.22, 90% CI = 0.05, 0.40) showed a low mean effect size, three-component interventions (n = 6, d = 0.52, 90% CI = 0.39, 0.65) showed a moderate effect size. Interventions conducted in individual sessions (n = 15, d = 0.40, 90% CI = 0.24, 0.56) showed a higher mean effect size than group interventions (n = 9, d = 0.08, 90% CI = − 0.04, 0.30) although the confidence intervals overlapped.
Conclusions

The study results indicate that future obesity prevention interventions targeting multiethnic and minority adults might benefit from incorporating individual sessions, family involvement, and problem solving strategies into multi-component programs that focus on lifestyle changes.

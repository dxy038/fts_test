A novel approach for designing linear-phase variable two-dimensional (2-D) digital filters is described, which is based on the matrix-array decomposition (MAD) of real-valued multidimensional arrays. By using the MAD, the desired variable 2-D magnitude response can be decomposed into the real-valued frequency response specifications of the normal zero-phase constant 2-D filters and the approximation specifications of multidimensional polynomials. Consequently, the problem of approximating the desired variable 2-D magnitude response can be decomposed into sub-problems that involve the design of zero-phase constant 2-D filters and the approximation of multidimensional polynomials. Once the zero-phase constant 2-D filters and the multidimensional polynomials are obtained, interconnecting them yields a zero-phase variable 2-D digital filter. Finally, a linear-phase variable 2-D digital filter can be easily obtained by simply modifying the zero-phase constant 2-D filters (noncausal) to linear-phase ones (causal) through shifting the filter coefficients. Since the sub-problems are much easier to solve than the direct approximation of the given variable 2-D magnitude specification, this MAD-based design approach is extremely efficient and straightforward. In designing zero-phase constant 2-D filters and approximating multidimensional polynomials, we also propose a new objective criterion for selecting appropriate filter orders and polynomial degrees. Furthermore, we also show that the resulting linear-phase variable 2-D filters have highly parallel structures and modularity, which are suitable for high-speed multidimensional signal processing. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the MAD-based design approach.

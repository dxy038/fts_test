Multiple transmitters/receivers (TX/RX) architecture for Free Space Optics (FSO) links are becoming a more viable solution to improve the quality of the FSO communication system. Received power level of the FSO system is one of parameter used to determine the FSO link performances. In this paper, the received power is theoretically calculated using the established equation prior to the experiment. Then it is experimentally measured using various numbers of transmitters and receivers. The objective is to compare both theoretical and experimental values of the received power to validate its correlation and how it affects the FSO link performances practically.

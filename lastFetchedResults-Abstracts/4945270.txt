A major problem in evaluating picture quality in image compression systems is the extreme difficulty in describing the type and amount of degradation in reconstructed image. Because of the inherent drawbacks associated with the subjective measures of picture quality, there has been a great deal of interest in developing an objective measure that can be used as a substitute. The aim of this paper is to examine a set of objective picture quality measures for application in still image compression systems and to highlight the correlation of these measures with subjective picture quality measures. Picture quality is measured using nine different objective picture quality measures and subjectively using mean opinion score (MOS) as a measure of perceived picture quality. The correlation between each objective measure and MOS is found. The effects of different image compression ratios are assessed and the best objective measures are proposed. Our results show that some objective measures correlate well with the perceived picture quality for a given compression algorithm but they are not reliable for an evaluation across different algorithms. So, we compared objective picture quality measures across different algorithms and we found measures, which serve well in all tested image compression systems.

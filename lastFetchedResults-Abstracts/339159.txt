Objective
We investigated the role of human stromal layers (hu-ST) on the ex vivo expansion/maintenance of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC) from adult bone marrow (BM) and umbilical cord blood (CB).
Materials and Methods

BM and CB CD34+-enriched cells were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with SCF, bFGF, LIF, and Flt-3, in the presence or absence of stroma, and analyzed for proliferation, phenotype, and clonogenic potential.
Results

Significant expansion of BM and CB CD34+ and CD34+CD38âˆ’ cells were achieved in the presence of hu-ST. The differentiative potential of both BM and CB CD34+-enriched cells cocultured with hu-ST was primarily shifted toward the myeloid lineage, while maintaining/expanding a CD7+ population. Clonogenic analysis of the expanded cells showed increases in progenitors of the myeloid lineage, including colony-forming unit-granulocyte, macrophage (CFU-GM) and colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte (CFU-Mix) for both BM (stroma and stroma-free conditions) and CB cells in the presence of stroma.
Conclusions

These results indicate that adult hu-ST in the presence of appropriate cytokines can be used to efficiently expand/maintain myeloid and lymphoid cell populations from human BM and CB HSC.

Objective: This cross-sectional analytical research studied the relationship between depressed mood and the content of metaphors. Method: Subjects consisted of 30 depressed patients and 30 normal volunteers. The depressed group were selected by a psychologist or psychiatrist, using a clinical interview based on DSM-IV and Beck's score (>15), and the normal group were also selected using a clinical interview and Beck's score(<15). Both groups were asked to do incomplete sentences test and metaphors inventory, and the relationship between mood and metaphors contents was worked out. Results: The results showed that there was a negative correlation between mood and metaphors contents; the more depressed was an individual, the more negative was the content of metaphors. Conclusion: This study is in line with the theories and research on the congruency of mood and memory retrieval.

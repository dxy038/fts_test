Security is the important criteria relevant to information in transit as well as in storage. This paper proposes a highly secure method to hide the secret messages to prevent unauthorized access. The proposed method works in three levels. Single level of encryption and two levels of steganography are used. First level makes use of a DNA based playfair encryption. Second level hides the encrypted secret file in a randomly generated DNA sequence. In the third level, embedded DNA is hidden in an audio file. The main objective of the proposed method is that no one could be able to find the existence of the secret file.

A single-phase switching mode bilateral convertor using current-forced hysteresis switching control is designed and successfully implemented. Based on the proposed current-forced switching scheme, the bidirectional power flow is very easy to control and the switching voltage jumps and losses can be reduced. Moreover, the line current can be sinusoidally regulated with unity power factor in the rectifier mode, and the voltage waveform distortion can be kept small in the inverter mode by instantaneous voltage control. To perform the control system design, the transfer function models of the proposed convertor system in two operation modes are built up, and then a generalised systematic design method is proposed to find the parameters of the controllers according to the prescribed specifications

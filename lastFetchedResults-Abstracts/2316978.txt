The objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of the growth of the Houston metropolitan area on the characteristics and intensity of convection and precipitation. For this purpose, we implemented the Town Energy Budget (TEB) urban model into Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). The Landsat Thematic Mapper National Land Cover Data (NLCD) for the Houston area corresponding to the years 1992, 2001 and 2006 were used for an objective experimental design of land-use sensitivity experiments. We analyzed the impact on two distinct groups of convective cells triggered by the sea breeze circulation on August 24 2000 and compared the model simulated precipitation to RADAR data. The first group of storms occurred southwest of the city and was not influenced by the urban cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), while the second was and occurred north of the city (downwind) a few hours later. The effect of land-use on convection and precipitation was dramatic for the storms SW of the city and it was linked to a monotonic increase in the intensity of the sea breeze. The intensification of the sea-breeze circulation when using the 1992, 2001, and 2006 NLCD land use datasets generated a monotonic increase of the total precipitated volume of 9, 11, and 25%, respectively (over a run with no city). Due to increased exposure to aerosols, the upper levels of the convective cells downwind of the city were invigorated by a greater latent heat release linked to higher amounts of liquid water transported to supercooled levels. However, precipitation did not show a monotonic behavior when we varied the intensity of the urban aerosol sources. With the highest aerosol concentrations, riming growth of ice particles became so inefficient that larger amounts of condensate was transported upwards into the storm anvil, contributing to a reduction in precipitation efficiency.

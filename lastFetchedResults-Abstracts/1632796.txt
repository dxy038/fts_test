In situ incorporation technique was used for coloration and acquiring excellent antibacterial properties for viscose fibers by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). AgNPs were prepared in situ and incorporated in viscose matrix directly without using any other reducing and stabilizing agents. The main objective of this research was to successfully employ the reducing and stabilizing features of cellulose to produce nanosilverâ€“viscose composites. Coloration of fibers after in situ AgNPs incorporation is related to surface plasmon resonance of silver. Colorimetric data were recorded as a function of washings to characterize the final colored fibers. Fastness properties and silver release were all measured to study the washable and wear off properties. Depending on the silver concentration, yellowish colored fibers with different shades were produced. Good fastness properties were obtained after 20 washings without using any crosslinker or binder. The colored fibers had excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, even after 20 washings.

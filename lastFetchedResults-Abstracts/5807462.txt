This paper presents the results of applying Haralik´s textures in the upland landform classification process. In environmental and landuse projects is important to know what kind of landforms are present in a geographic area. The objective of this work is to improve the performance of such classifications, adding information to the commonly used data features in such problems. The texture information was extracted using the method of Haralick, parameterized with moving windows of geo-referenced maps in raster format. Those maps contains information of the terrain morphology such as elevation, slopes, etc. Several tests were performed using different classifiers and cross-validation over a dataset with a total of 203401 samples. It was shown that Haralick´s textures features are useful for the problem, because its performance is higher (about 97 %) in comparison with the achieved when using only morphological information of the terrain.

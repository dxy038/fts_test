The quality of audio signals that have been encoded with low-bit rate audio coding standards is degraded because the high frequency information has been removed. The quality of such audio signals can, however, be improved by reconstructing the high frequency information which was lost. In this paper the principles of audio signal production and the characteristics of the human hearing system have been used to develop a blind high frequency reconstruction method based on chaotic prediction theory. Performance evaluation with objective and subjective tests has shown that this method is, in most cases, more efficient than other blind high frequency reconstruction methods.

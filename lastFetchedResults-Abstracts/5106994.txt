The objective of this article is to introduce portable devices capable of providing video images of the tympanic membrane and tympanic cavity of the ear. Specifically, digital video otoscopy is introduced as an effective platform for tympanic membrane characterization. In addition, we show how digital image enhancement and segmentation processing techniques can be applied to the acquired images, which could provide more visual detail and objective clinical interpretation.

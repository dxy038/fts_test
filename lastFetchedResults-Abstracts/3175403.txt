Objective: Scrophularia ningpoensis hemsl is a kind of traditional Chinese medicinal materials with high medicinal purposes value and wide application. It had important meanding to analyze its volatile oil consitituents on expanding its utilization and increasing the added value. Methods: The volatile compounds of scrophularia ningpoensis hemsl were isolated with steam distillation and identified by capillary GC/MS and the relative contents of the constitons were detemined by area normalization method. Results: 64 volatile components were identified and determined, accounting for 96.89% of the total area of the peaks. Conclusion: The main volatile compounds are: furfural, 5-methyl-2-furan carboxaldehyde, Z-5-methyl-6-heneicosen-ll-one, palmitic acid, furfuryl alcohol, acetylfuran, terpineol, m-Cresol, 2-Acetylpyrrole, o-Guaiacol, phenylethyl alcohol, (2Z)-2, 4-pentadien-1-ol, 3-ethyl, isovaleric acid, Spiro[2.4]heptan-4-one, phenylethyl alcohol, 4-ethyl-2-methoxy-phenol, 4-Vinylguaiacol and sobutyric acid.

Uplink communication in a cellular radio network is considered where the base station in each cell employs linear or nonlinear (decision feedback) multiuser receivers. For any such receiver, the problem of interest is that of minimizing the total transmit power under the constraint that all the users of the network achieve their quality-of-service objective in terms of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). When the solution is feasible for the desired SIR requirements, the optimum powers are computed with a distributed iterative power control strategy suitable for implementation at each base station. While the deterministic algorithm requires both in-cell and out-of-cell user information, the stochastic algorithm proposed in this paper can be implemented at the base stations in a truly distributed manner requiring knowledge of only in-cell parameters. Such an algorithm was proposed previously for the case where base stations use linear (single user) matched filter (MF) receivers. However, the feasibility region in terms of attainable SIRs for a well-designed multiuser receiver, particularly for a nonlinear receiver that employs decision feedback, is generally much larger than it is for the linear MF receiver. The stochastic power control algorithm in this paper, for linear or nonlinear multiuser receivers, converges in the mean-square sense to the minimal powers when the target SIRs are feasible. The second major focus of this paper is to improve the convergence properties of the conventional stochastic approximation based power control strategy by using the more recent results on averaging. Convergence issues of both the "nonaveraged" and "averaged" algorithms are investigated, and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance improvement due to averaging.

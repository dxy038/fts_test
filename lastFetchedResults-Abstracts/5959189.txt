Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technology that transports voice data packets across packet switched networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). Perceived speech quality is the key metric for QoS for VoIP applications. The most popular objective measurement method for VoIP voice is E-Model. The primary aim of this work is to investigate the how the delay affect the VoIP quality and how to combined the affection in to standard E-Model. In this paper, a testing environment to measure the impairment of different delay jitter is setup. The Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) were calculated, Perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) algorithm is used. We use stand deviation of delay to describe the delay effect on voice quality, and give a new Ij formula, which is added to the standard E-model, as jitter impairment factor. Good accuracy is achieved by our new extended E-model.

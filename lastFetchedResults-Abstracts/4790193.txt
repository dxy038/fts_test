To meet the demand of crops irrigation water, the optimal planning model of the field water saving irrigation, in which minimum incremental annual cost of field water saving irrigation engineering is the objective function, has been established based on types of water resource, agricultural utilizable water yield, crop planting structure, status of water saving irrigation and feasibility of each water saving irrigation technology. To use the model, the Xinjiang Hetian region optimal plan of water saving irrigation that includes optimal development scale of water saving irrigation for each crop in the region has been put forward in 2020. The model provides a scientific basis for reasonable planning of water saving irrigation and optimal allocation of water and land resources in region.

This paper proposes an interactive manipulation of signing avatar (complex humanÂ´s figures) by means of a descriptive sign language. The objective is to improve the human-computer communication, to generate precise signs for Deaf community, to control and animate the virtual character. This approach has been developed to manipulate robots through several analytic and numerical resolution methods. These methods have been applied to the virtual character for better monitoring and to ensure a realistic animation in real time.

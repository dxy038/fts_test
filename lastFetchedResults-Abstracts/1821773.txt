Objective
neficial effects of kappa opioid agonist U-50,488 in preventing periodontal disease (PD) progression in rats have already been described, but its mechanism of action is unknown. The present study evaluated the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in the gingival tissues of rats with ligature-induced PD, treated with U-50,488. It also correlated the effects of this agonist with myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and the presence of osteoclasts.

oltzman rats weighing 250–300 g were divided into four groups: (1) control, (2) ligature, (3) ligature + saline and (4) ligature + kappa agonist. Experimental PD was induced by placing a sterile silk ligature around the 2nd left upper molar. Rats from groups 3 to 4 were locally administered with either saline or U-50,488, respectively, from day 3 to day 5 following ligation. After 5 or 11 days, the rats were euthanized and periodontal tissue samples were collected for histological and morphometric analysis and for determination of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and MPO.
s
re placement induced significant alveolar bone loss. The number of osteoclasts, degree of MPO activity, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α expression were also increased by PD. U-50,488 reduced both bone loss and the number of osteoclasts, but did not alter histological inflammatory infiltrate or MPO activity. U-50,488 significantly reduced IL-6 and increased IL-10 levels, but did not affect TNF-α and IL-8.
sion
ng the levels of IL-6 and increasing IL-10 are important mechanisms by which U-50,488 reduces alveolar bone loss in ligature-induced periodontal disease.

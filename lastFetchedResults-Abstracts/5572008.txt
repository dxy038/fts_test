Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium Leprae, and generally compromises neural fibers, leading to the development of disabilities. These limit daily activities or social life. In leprosy, the study of disability considered functional (physical) and activity limitations; and social participation. These are measured respectively by EHF and SALSA scales; by and PARTICIPATION SCALE. The objective of this work was to propose a support system, SeyeS, to eyes disabilities development and progression identification, applying Bayesians network - BN´s. It is expected that the proposed system be applied in monitoring the patient during treatment and after therapeutic cure of leprosy. SeyeS presented specificity 1 and sensitivity 0.6 in the identification of ocular disabilities development. With Seyes was discovered that the presence of trichiasis and lagophthalmos, tend to increase the probability of developing more disabilities. Otherwise, characteristics as cataracts tend to decrease development of other disabilities, considering that medical interventions could reduce it. The more import of this system is to indicate what should be monitored, and which elements needs interventions to not increasing patient´s ocular disabilities.

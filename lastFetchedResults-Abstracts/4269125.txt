An artificial neural network was developed for modeling of rough rice drying. The ANN outputs are the six performance indices: energy consumption, kernel cracking, final moisture content, moisture removal rate, drying intensity and water mass removal rate. The inputsÂ´ four drying parameters -ice layer thickness (RLT), hot airflow rate (HAR), hot air temperature (THA) and drying time (TD)- are the inputs of the neural network. The optimal model is a four-layered backpropagation neural network, with 8 and 5 neurons in the first and the second hidden layers, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated using experimental data. The mean relative error varied from 2.0% to 8.3% for 6 predictions with average of 4.4%. Using a multiple-objective programming for optimization of the drying parameters, the optimal values are: RLT=66 cm, HAR=0.30 m/s, THA=93&#176;C and TD=23 min

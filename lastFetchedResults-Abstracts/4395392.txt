This paper proposes a novel multiple-input bidirectional DC-DC power converter to interface more than two dc sources of different voltage levels. This finds applications in distributed energy resources (DER), micro grid, and hybrid electric/fuel cell vehicles, where different dc sources of unequal voltage levels need to be connected with bidirectional power flow capability. Converter can be used to operate in both the buck and boost modes with bidirectional power control. It is also possible to independently control power flow when more than two sources are actively transferring power in either direction. This paper presents a power converter topology based on three switching legs of a standard 3-phase inverter module. The operation, analysis and design of the converter are presented with different modes of power transfer. Proposed converter is demonstrated for fuel cell vehicle application using real-time hardware-in-the-loop system. Results for a 5kW system are presented validating the theoretical analysis.

This paper presents robust tuning of Proportional Integral Derivative Power System Stabilizers (PID-PSS) using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Tow heuristic methods, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are used to PID-PSS parameters tuning minimizing an objective function and results are compared with each other which Eigen value analysis is used for comparison. The proposed method is confirmed by obtained simulation results of a Three-Machine power system under different operating conditions.

Background&Objective: Acne rosacea is a recarrent chronic and inflammatoy skin disease. According to the prevalance of acne rosacea, importance of determining its etiology and contravercies about the role of demodex mites in expression of the disease, this study has been done on patients who has been referred to Booali and Loghman hospitals during 1370-1380.
Materials&methods: This research was a case -control study. The case group has been acne rosacea patients according to the pathologic report and there has been two control groups: one, who has had discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and the other one , those who has been affected by actinic lichen planus (ALP).The groups have been matched for theirage and sex. Pathologic specimens being provided by skin biopsy technique, have been studied for the determining the presence and density of demodex mites, the results has been recorded on special information sheets and their role in expression of acne rosacea and its odds ratio have determined.
Results: This study has been done on 225 patients. 75 in case group (acne rosacea), and 75 in patients in each of the control groups (DLE and ALP). There was no statistical difference in the age and sex of patients in these groups .16% of the control group and 38%of case group had demodex mites (p<0.05) and the presence of this parasite has increased the chance of expressing acne rosacea by 3.3times .The mean count of demodex mites in DLE and ALP groups has been 0.66 and 0.2 respectively, whereas, in case group, it was 1.4 (p<0.05).
Conclusion: We concluded that the presence and density of demodex mites increases the chance of expression of acne rosacea. Further studies for determining the effect of treating these mites in acne rosacea is recommended.

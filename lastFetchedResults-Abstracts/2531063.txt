Objective: This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of maladaptive schemas between&nbsp;childhood emotional maltreatment and psychological distress among college students.
Methods: This was a descriptive-correlative and after the fact study. A total of 315 students&nbsp;were selected with multistage cluster sampling from students of Tehran universities. The&nbsp;participants completed the lifetime of experiences questionnaire (LEQ), Young&rsquo;s schema&nbsp;questionnaire short form with 90-item (YSQ-SF-3), and the trauma symptom checklist-40&nbsp;(TSC-40). Data were analyzed by path analysis using SPSS 16.
Results: The results indicated that perception of childhood emotional maltreatment was&nbsp;associated with later psychological distress and mediated through schema of defectiveness/&nbsp;shame, vulnerability to harm, self-sacrifice, and entitlement.
Conclusion: In this study, our findings suggested that childhood emotional maltreatment is&nbsp;contributed to later psychological distress by developing cognitive vulnerability of children&nbsp;through maladaptive schemas. These schemas are rigid and extreme cognitive structures that&nbsp;negatively filter and bias cognitive and emotional information.

In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient scheduling algorithm for a relay-aided shared LTE network using CoMP and LB. A new complex scenario has been considered using a combination of the aforementioned four techniques. More explicitly, relay and LTE technologies are employed. In order to provide high-throughput for users at anywhere and anytime, we combine the relaying, the cooperative multipoint and the load balancing techniques in this paper, so as to increase the cell-edge users´ throughput. Moreover, the interested area is jointly covered by two operators, who have an agreement in sharing their resources. For such a complicated relay-aided shared LTE network, we propose an energy efficient scheduling algorithm, whose objective is increase significantly the throughput and energy efficiency in the two operators´ network sharing environment. Results have show meaningful increase up on the cell edge throughput when compared to conventional single cell. More specifically, the combined cooperative techniques, including single cell, relaying and CoMP scenario show significant improvement in throughput and energy consumption in the transmission stage, and in general a meaningful throughput improvement in the two LTE operators network sharing environment were achieved.

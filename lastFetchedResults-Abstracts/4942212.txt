The clouds and the sky are more and more faced with rapidly changing situations and increasingly complex configurations which are harder to be adequately controlled in a centralized manner. In this paper we propose an autonomic architecture for controlling and managing future virtual networks within the clouds and the sky. This solution permits to achieve control and management functions in a decentralized way, dealing locally with simpler situations in a more responsive way. This autonomic architecture is made of Distributed Intelligent Agents, each capable of sensing and observing events and changes occurring locally. These agents communicate among neighbors to improve their knowledge and to make consolidated/coordinated decisions. As a summary, the objective of the autonomic architecture is to allow both a way to manage the clouds and an automatic real time control of virtual networks.

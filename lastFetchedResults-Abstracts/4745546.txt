A novel rear-illuminated pin-photodiode sensitive to only the wavelength of 1.55 &#956;m-band has been successfully developed. This photodiode has an InGaAs absorption layer and double InGaAsP filter layers. The responsivity at the wavelength of 1.55 &#956;m was higher than 0.95 A/W, while the responsivity at the wavelength of 1.3 &#956;m was less than 0.005 A/W. The wavelength selectivity between 1.3 &#956;m and 1.55 &#956;m was as high as 23 dB. This feature is useful to suppress optical crosstalk from a 1.3 &#956;m transmitter to a 1.55 &#956;m receiver. Therefore, this photodiode is promising for the receiver of 1.3/1.55 &#956;m bi-directional optical transceiver modules. A bidirectional transceiver module has been constructed using this photodiode to confirm the fundamental operation. The high receiver sensitivity of -35.5 dBm at B.E.R.(Bit Error Ratio)=10<sup>-10</sup> was demonstrated at 156 Mbps full-duplex operation

This paper is concerned with vector control of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). Recent research has indicated that PMSM could become a serious competitor to the induction motor (IM) for high performance servo applications. Mathematical model of a PMSM is developed with the help of Park and Clarke transformations. The concept of vector control is applied to PMSM to obtain linear dynamics similar to that of a DC motor. The linearized model consists of two control loops namely, current loop and speed loop. The objective of the control scheme is to achieve very fast response. The performance of PMSM drive system under different speed reference input is evaluated on the basis of simulation and experimental results. All the experiments have been done on PMSM with the help of ADMC-401 motor control DSP and an inverter circuit.

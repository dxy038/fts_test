Background: Hyperalgesia and allodynia are two of the most critcal debilitating symptoms in patients with diabetes mellitus. In this study, the threshold of the acute and chronic pain was measured using formalin and hot plate tests in male rats. In another experiments, we studied the anti-hyperalgesic effect of alcoholic Datura seed extract in diabetic rats.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of alcoholic Datura stramonium seed extract on hyperalgesia induced by diabetic mellitus.
Method: Experimental animals were made diabetic (n=12-15) using a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg, i.p). After 30 days their pain threshold in each test group was compared with control group (n=12-15).
Results: Our statistical data analysis showed that the acute and chronic pains arising from formalin and hot plate tests were markedly augmented due to diabeties mellitus. In additional experiments we assessed the acute and chronic pain in groups 1-control+extract (n=12-15) and 2-diabetic+extract (n=12-15). The extract was administered for 30 days every other day. The results showed that the extract (over than 50 mg/kg/BW) could significantly diminish the augmented acute pain in hot plate and formalin tests. In contrast, chronic formalin pain did not change by the extract in dosage of 50 mg/kg/BW and over.
Conclusion: The acute pain in hot plate and first phase of formalin tests were significantly augmented due to diabetes mellitus. Also, it was shown that the Datura seed extract could have diminished the augmented acute pain in both tests, but chronic formalin pain could not be influenced by doses of the extract higher than 50 mg/kg/BW.

Objective(s): To determine iron intake, blood indices and some dietary components that affect the iron situation among adolescent girls.
Material & Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 336 adolescent girls. Iron intake and some effective components in diet were measured with 3 days 24 hour recall and food frequency questionnaire and blood indices determined with 10 cc sample of blood using CBC and serum ferritin.
Results: The results indicated that the mean iron intake and blood indices of iron deficiency anemia were in acceptable ranges (19.6 ± 7.8, 19.0 ± 4.6) respectively. Although there were some inhibiting factors such as phytate and tea consumption for iron absorption but the effect of increased absorption factors such as vegetables and fruits and meat intakes were more effective.
Conclusion: The situation of anemia among adolescent in this study was found to be better than the other studies in the country. Although the study subjects had good habits and behaviors in their daily food intake but planning educational programs is recommended.

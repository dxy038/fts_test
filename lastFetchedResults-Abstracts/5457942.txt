Over the years, a consensus has been reached that the introduction of 3D entertainment can only be a lasting success if the perceived image quality and the viewing comfort are better than those of conventional 2D television. There are different factors that affect the perceived quality of 3D content. In this paper, our objective is to obtain a good understanding of the effect that brightness has on the visual quality of 3D videos and compare it to that of the 2D. We capture outdoor and indoor scenes with different exposures and we perform subjective evaluation to investigate how brightness affects the perceived quality of the 3D experience.

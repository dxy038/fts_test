Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine patterns of diagnosis and relative survival in women who had a diagnosis of primary invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) from 1973 to 1997, with follow-up through the end of 1999.
Study design
From the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, 32,845 women diagnosed between 1973 and 1997 were used for analysis. The study population was divided in three cohorts based on year of diagnosis and the cohorts were compared with respect to variables of interest by using Ï‡2 tests and relative survival analysis by the life table method.
Results
There was an increase in the proportions of minorities diagnosed with EOC, of women 60 years or older at diagnosis, and of women undergoing surgery over time. Survival continuously improved over time, although older patients (60 years or older) and African Americans continued to have the poorest survival.
Conclusion
Over time, relative survival of women who had primary invasive EOC diagnosed improved.

This paper proposes a multiple-objective fuzzy optimization model for an independent transmission company (ITC) to plan its transmission enhancements. There are several objectives to be considered, such as investment cost objective, power transfer efficiency objective, revenue objective, network congestion mitigation objective and environmental concern objective. The uncertain capital investment are also taken into account in the proposed model. By applying fuzzy set theory, the above multi-objective optimization model has been converted into a regular single-objective optimization problem to be solved. The numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model

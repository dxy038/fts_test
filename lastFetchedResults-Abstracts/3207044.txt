This paper presents the service restoration of distribution system with distributed generation for reliability worth in a distribution system. The objective is to minimize the customer outage cost subject to the maximum number of distributed generations, total capacity of distributed generation, bus voltage limits, current transfer capability of the feeders and only one distributed generation for one installation position. The technique employed to solve the minimization problem is based on a developed Tabu search algorithm and reliability worth analysis. The reliability worth analysis provides an indirect measure for cost implication associated with power failure. The developed methodology is tested with a distribution system of Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) bus 2. Numerical results from the tests demonstrate that distributed generation can be used to promote the reliability of the distribution system.

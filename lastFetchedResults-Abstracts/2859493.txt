In December 2003 the MPS. BR Program was launched aiming at establishing and disseminating a software process reference model -- the MPS-SW -- allowing both micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and large organizations to achieve the benefits of process improvement. Nowadays, ten years later, the achieved results exceed MPS. BRÂ´s predefined benchmarks in several ways. [Objective] This paper aims at providing an overview on the MPS-SW model and presenting these results, describing its nationwide adoption in Brazil (more than 500 assessments spread across the country) and outcomes of two recent surveys concerning the impact of such adoption in the software industry. [Method] We planned surveys to capture the impact from two different and complementary points of view: the qualitative perception of the customers (sponsors of MPS-SW adopting organizations) and the performance results of organizations that adopted the model (e.g. concerning productivity, quality and estimation accuracy). [Results] Results of the qualitative survey indicated that the adoption was motivated by both business and technical reasons and that most sponsors are satisfied with the obtained improvements and would recommend the MPS-SW model. Results of the survey on performance results indicated higher productivity, quality and estimation accuracy for organizations assessed in higher maturity levels.

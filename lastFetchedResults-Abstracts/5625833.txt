Optimizing the transmission ranges between nodes and balancing the number of nodes among clusters are two feasible approaches to conserve the limited battery power in exchanging messages when designing power-efficient (or green) clustered wireless ad hoc networks. To achieve this objective, we first employ the concept of Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG) to obtain a power-efficient logical network topology in which the transmission ranges between nodes are adjusted to the optimal. Then, based on the obtained RNG-based logical network topology, we present a green clustering algorithm to organize the wireless ad hoc network into a clustered architecture in which the number of nodes among clusters is balanced. Simulation results confirm that the presented approaches not only optimize the transmission ranges between nodes but also balance the number of nodes among clusters. Thus, the organized clustered wireless ad hoc network is regarded as power-efficient (or green).

Abstract
Introduction: Today self-management is one of the strategies for chronic disease control such as diabetes. Self-management activities are designed based on patients’ active participation in control and management of chronic disease challenges and prevention of disease complications.
Objective: This study aimed to examine the effect of diabetes self-management program on   blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin among patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods: In this randomized, controlled trial, 80 patients with type 2 diabetes who referred to Rasht Diabetes Association participated. They were randomly assigned to two groups of intervention and control. Self-management program involved knowledge and understanding, problem-solving process, diet plan, walking and stress management which were taught to patients for three weeks and followed for two months. Data were gathered by demographic questionnaire and measurement of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin before and eight weeks after the intervention. In addition patients’ blood glucose level was monitored weekly. Data were analyzed by statistical tests such as Chi-square, Fisher's exact, Student-t, Paired-t tests and repeated measure ANOVA. 
Results: Findings showed no significant differences in experimental and control group as regard to demographic, disease condition, drug use and blood glucose criteria. Blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin improved significantly in experiment group two months after the intervention. These changes were not seen in the control group. In addition a significant difference was shown between the two groups as regard to level of glycosylated hemoglobin after intervention (P < 0/001).
Conclusion: In attention to findings, it can be concluded that self-management program promotes blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore self-management promotion program can serve as guide in improvement of patient health.

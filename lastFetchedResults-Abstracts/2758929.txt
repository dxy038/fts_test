Power loss reduction can be considered as one of the main purposes for distribution system operators. Reconfiguration is an operation process used for this optimisation by means of changing the status of switches in a distribution network. Recently, all system operators tried their best in order to obtain well-balanced distribution systems to decrease the operation cost, improve reliability and reduce power loss. This study presents an efficient method for solving the multi-objective reconfiguration of radial distribution systems with regard to distributed generators. The conventional distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) problem cannot meet the reliability requirements, because it only considers loss and voltage deviation as objective functions. The proposed approach considers reliability, operation cost and loss simultaneously. By adding the reliability objective to the DFR problem, this problem becomes more complicated than before and it needs to be solved with an accurate algorithm. Therefore this study utilises an Enhanced Gravitational Search Algorithm called EGSA which profits from a special mutation strategy in order to reduce the processing time and improve the quality of solutions, particularly to avoid being trapped in local optima. The proposed approach has been applied to two distribution test systems including IEEE 33 and 70-node test systems.

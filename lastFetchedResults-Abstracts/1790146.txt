Our objective was to study an unstirred Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) closed system that shows transient spatio-temporal chaos before reaching a periodic attractor. The following sequence of well-defined dynamic regimes was observed during the reaction: chaotic, quasiperiodic, periodic and steady. This is the first time that an inverse transient Ruelle–Takens–Newhouse scenario has been observed during the temporal evolution of an unstirred closed BZ-system.

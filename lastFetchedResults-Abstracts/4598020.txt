Random early detection (RED) is expected to eliminate global synchronization by random active packet drop. Its packet drop probability is decided by the maximum packet drop probability in its drop function, the buffer thresholds, and the average queue length. It has been observed that, for a large number of connections, a small value of maximum drop probability does not eliminate global synchronization. Furthermore, since RED uses its four parameters to regulate its performance, it is necessary to relate its maximum drop probability with its other parameters. Our objective is to develop a model for the maximum drop probability of RED, based on a TCP channel model and traffic characteristics. The value of maximum drop probability obtained by our model makes RED queueing achieve its targeted goals described in IETF documents.

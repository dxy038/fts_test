We present a multi agent architecture for controlling a mobile robot in an unpredictable environment. This architecture has been developed with the objective of coordinating the various competences of the robot (e.g., perception, navigation, planning). The architecture is made up of two agents: the first one specialized for cognitive tasks, the second one dedicated to control of the robotÂ´s physical devices. This two agent architecture guarantees a good robustness of the system, as the navigation modules can run independently of the cognitive ones

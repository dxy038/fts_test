In this paper we propose a new 0-1 integer linear formulation for optimal PLA folding. An efficient heuristic algorithm is presented which finds optimal PLA folding in polynomial time. The algorithm finds the maximum matching of a given green-edge graph. Then, directions are assigned to each selected edge to minimize a certain objective function on a red-edge graph. The existing alternating cycles are verified and eliminated. Finally, the coordinates of each interconnection of PLA are computed. Test results show that the algorithm is efficient and gives the optimal solutions for most cases

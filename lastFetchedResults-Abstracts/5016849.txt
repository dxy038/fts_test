Teaching undergraduate electrical and computer engineering students microcontroller/microprocessor design concepts is essential in todayÂ´s highly advanced technological environment. Furthermore, the authors believe that all engineering students should take an introductory course in this area. With this objective in mind, a PIC-based microcontroller design laboratory was developed. This Laboratory consists of a development board based on PIC16F877A microcontroller from microchip, essential software routines, and a laboratory manual that contains a list of design-applications experiments

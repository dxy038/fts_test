We present a communication analysis for hard real-time systems interconnects. The objective is to provide tight estimates on the worst-case communication latency between communicating processing elements that use a priority-aware communication medium for data transmission. The communication model consists of communication tasks transmitting data across a series of pipelined resources. The analysis incorporates interferences caused by multiple communication tasks requesting the pipelined resources, and it captures parallel transmission of data between multiple pipeline stages. We call this analysis a stage-level analysis. We evaluate the proposed analysis through simulation of synthetic benchmarks, and we apply the analysis to an instantiation of a platform proposed by Shi and Burns. Our experiments confirm that stage-level analysis provides tight upper-bounds when compared to previous work and improves schedulability by 34 percent.

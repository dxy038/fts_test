Software development outsourcing has been growing steadily. However significant outsourcing failure rates have also been reported. One of the major issues in outsourcing business is that many organisations undertake software outsourcing initiatives without knowing whether or not they are ready to undertake them. The objective of this project is to develop a readiness model in order to measure the organisationpsilas (vendor) readiness for software development outsourcing. Two types of data will be collected in this research project: firstly, factors that can have a positive or negative impact on software outsourcing clients in the selection of software development outsourcing vendors; and secondly, how one can implement these factors. The anticipated outcome of this project will be a software outsourcing readiness model to assist software practitioners in the design of effective software outsourcing strategies. This model should assist outsourcing vendors in measuring the strength or weakness of software outsourcing activities.

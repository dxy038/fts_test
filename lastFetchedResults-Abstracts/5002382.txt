Channel assignment problem is an example of NP-complete problem in which the complexity and level of difficulty depends on the input parameters of a particular condition. Therefore, a good technique with an efficient optimization approach will produce a good assignment if not optimum. This paper proposes the use of permutation technique adopted from evolutionary strategy in producing various number of cell orders for channel assignment task. Subject to three different constraints, the objective is to find the minimum number of channels used in order to satisfy various numbers of demands from each cell. The proposed algorithm was tested on standard benchmark problems and the results obtained show the effectiveness of a simple yet efficient algorithm with the help of an improved shift mutation technique that are normally applied in evolutionary strategy.

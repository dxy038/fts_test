Female exposure of males could be a low-cost biostimulation option that benefits AI in commercial rabbit operations by improving buck rabbits reproductive performance. The objective of the study was to evaluate exposure of buck rabbits to females as a biostimulation option to improve reproductive potential. Treatments were: exposure (biostimulated) or not (control) of bucks to does. Bucks were New Zealand White, 15-month-old, sexually experienced and fertile. Experimental design was completely random with nine replications, experimental unit was one buck. Doe exposure was permanent using replacement pubertal does housed in an adjacent wire-mesh cage and changed for new ones every other week. Semen collection lasted 14 weeks (late winter and early spring) twice a week with two ejaculates at each collection. Analyses of variance were under a mixed model: treatments, ejaculate number and season were fixed and rabbit random effects and buck weight at each collection as covariable. Biostimulated bucks showed greater (P &lt; 0.05) reproductive potential due to: 7% lesser reaction time (greater libido); and increased semen volume (40%), sperm motility (29%), sperm per ejaculate (31%), normal alive motile sperm (65%) and number of semen doses (64%). Semen characteristics differed by season in control bucks but not in doe exposed bucks (treatment Ã— ejaculate number, P &lt; 0.05). Reproductive potential in spring was greater (P &lt; 0.05) than in winter in both treatments. Doe exposure is a biostimulation method that improves sexual drive and sperm production and quality of buck rabbits.

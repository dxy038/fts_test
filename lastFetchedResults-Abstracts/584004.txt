The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of cottonseed meal (CSM) treated with sodium bentonite (SB) on laying hen profit and apparent digestibility of nutrients. A 3Ã—3 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design with 9 dietary treatments of 4 replicates consisting 3 levels of SB (0, 1 and 2%) and 3 levels of CSM (0, 10 and 20%) were tested. Nine mash diets were fed to 288 commercial Hy-Line W-36 hens from 51 weeks of age for 12 weeks. Feeding 20% CSM reduced apparent digestibility of organic matter and egg production and increased feed cost. Inclusion of 10% CSM did not have adverse impacts on nutrients digestibility and hen performance. Interestingly, CSM at the level of 10% increased economic profit and reduced excreta moisture. Egg shell quality was not influenced by SB or CSM. The SB significantly decreased apparent digestibility of dry matter and organic matter; however did not have deleterious effects on productive traits. In overall, diet with 1% SB and 10% CSM resulted in the best performance and the most economic profit of laying hens.

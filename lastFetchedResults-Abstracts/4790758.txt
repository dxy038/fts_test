Recently, a number of companies announced the Blu-ray Disc format. The format is based on a blue-laser diode 405 nm, an objective lens with a high numerical aperture (NA = 0.85), a disc with a thin cover layer (0.1 mm. thick), and phase-change recording on a groove-only substrate. The rewritable area of the Blu-ray Disc has a fixed track pitch of 320 nm and a scalable linear density that results in a capacity of 213 GB or 25 GB on a CD-size disc. Further improvement of media technology will allow higher linear densities and extension to dual-layer. In this paper we explain the basic concept of the wobble-address format of the Blu-ray Disc and demonstrate its robustness experimentally.

Load balancing is one of the important issues in power quality. In this paper a new method is presented for load balancing in LV distribution network considering different time-intervals (long term), using Modified Leapfrog method (MOLFOP). For this purpose, firstly the load balancing objective function for constant loads is extended to consider load changes in any time interval and then the statuses of loads´ connections to different phases are obtained using MOLFOP method in the studying period. Next, the load arrangement obtained from the proposed method is compared with the load arrangement from fixed load balancing in light, average and full load hours. Finally, the best loads´ arrangement and loss reduction corresponding to each case and suitable case for load balancing are specified.

This work investigates the feasibility of utilizing an electromagnetic-team fuzzy logic (EM-TFL) robust identifier for use with the particle swarm optimization technique to increase the efficiency and fuel economy of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain system in series configuration. This optimization necessitates the characterization of the key electromechanical components of the hybrid electric powertrain system which includes a PM generator and an electric motor drive system. The basic objective of improving the fuel economy while maintaining the performance of the vehicle is met through the implementation of a particle swarm optimization algorithm.

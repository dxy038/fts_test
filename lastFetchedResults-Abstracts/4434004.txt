By piecewise Lyapunov function , a general class of bidirectional associative memory with impulsive and delay is studied.Several global exponential stability criteria of the equilibrium point are established.Two linear impulsive neural networks with delays are constructed, which can be used to design impulsive controllers to control the exponential stability of the system. This method is possible in practical application.

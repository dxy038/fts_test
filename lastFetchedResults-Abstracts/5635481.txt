An evaluation model of Gray Relational Analysis with preferences of decision makers based on Characteristics-AHP is built. This model makes fully use of the advantage of gray theory on the fields of performance evaluation for small sample and poor data. Considering preference degree of decision-makers not only makes evaluation result objective and fairness, but also reflects decision-making fact. On preference weightÂ´s determination, characteristics-AHP model is used, which reduces subjective effect. Empirical practice and simulation analysis show the advantage and applicability of this model on relative fields.

This paper proposes a high frequency AC/AC converter based on Z-source, which is composed of input filtering circuit, inductor, input cycloconverter, high frequency transformer, output cycloconverter, control switch and output filter. The paper gives in-depth the steady-state principle and control strategy of the circuit. Finally, the simulation and experimental results show that the converter has the merits of output transformation, frequency conversion, high frequency electrical isolation, bidirectional power flow, load adaptability, etc. And it lays a key technique foundation for Intelligent Universal Transformer (IUT), sinusoidal AC voltage stabilizer, voltage regulators, and power compensator.

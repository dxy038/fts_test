Background: Nowadays, extensive technological advancements have made it
possible to use nanopaints which show exciting properties. In IR Iran excessive radon
levels (up to 3700 Bq m–3) have been reported in homes located in radon prone
areas. Over the past decades, concerns have been raised about the risk posed by residential
radon exposure.
Objective: This study aims at investigating the effect of using nanomaterial containing
wall paints on radon concentration in homes.
Methods: Two wooden model houses were used in this study. Soil samples from
Ramsar high background radiation areas were used for simulating the situation of a
typical house in radon-prone areas. Conventional water-soluble wall paint was used
for painting the walls of the 1st house model; while the 2nd house model was painted
with the same wall paint with montmorillonite nanoclay.
Results: Three days after sealing the house models, radon level was measured
by using a portable radon survey meter. The mean radon level inside the 1st house
model (conventional paint) was 515.3 ± 17.8 Bq/m3 while the mean radon concentration
in the 2nd house model (nano-painted house model) was 570.8 ± 18.5 Bq/m3.
The difference between these means was statistically significant (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first investigation on
the effect of nano-material containing wall paints on indoor radon concentrations.
It can be concluded that nano-material-containing wall paints should not be used in
houses with wooden walls located in radon prone areas. Although the mechanism of
this effect is not clearly known, decreased porosity in nano-paints might be a key factor
in increasing the radon concentration in homes.

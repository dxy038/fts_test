Objective: Preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction are associated with poor placental perfusion, which may be accompanied by a compensatory release of vasoactive substances in the fetoplacental circuit. This study examines the effects of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction on nitric oxide and prostacyclin signaling pathways in fetal endothelial cells. Study Design: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells from 30 control pregnancies, 18 pregnancies with preeclampsia, and 9 pregnancies with intrauterine growth restriction were cultured. Intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate accumulation and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α production were determined. Results: Intracellular accumulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate was significantly higher in the preeclampsia group and lower in the growth restriction group than in the control group (9.8, 1.8, and 3.9 pmol/μg protein for 5 minutes, respectively), whereas 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α production was not significantly different in the 3 groups. Conclusion: The data suggest that the fetoplacental vascular response to preeclampsia is to increase production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, perhaps to maintain vessel dilatation and maximum flow through placental villi. In fetal growth restriction the umbilical vein endothelial cells do not or cannot respond to chronic hypoxia by increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which may lead to fetoplacental vasoconstriction.

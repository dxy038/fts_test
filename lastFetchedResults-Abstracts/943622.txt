Background& Objective: The aim of this study is evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients between two cities Kerman and Ahvaz with difference in culture, race and climate. 
Subjects & Methods: In this crass-sectional study we enrolled 211 diabetic patients from Golestan diabetes care center of Ahvaz and 190 diabetic patients who were referred to Samen diabetes care center in Kerman. A questionnaire completed after direct interview examination and libratory assessment. The data were analyzed by SPSS 15 software. Standard chi-square test was used to compare the prevalence rates and the Means were compared by standard t test.
Results: The total number of patients from Golestan center of Ahvaz was 211 (144 female (68.6%) and 67 male (31.4%)) with mean age of 55.52±10.32 years old and mean of duration of disease 6.72±6.39 years. Also the total number of patients from Samen center of Kerman was 190 (161 female (85.5%) and 29 male (14.5%)) with mean age of 54.37± 9.75 years old and mean of duration of disease 8.78 ±7.48 years. Overall, arterial hypertension, cigarette smoking and low HDL-C were more frequent between Ahvasien patients (P < 0.0001, P=0.0004 and P < 0.0001 respectively (.In contrast 20.4% of Kermanien patients were opium user and dyslipidemy as trouble in triglyceride were more frequent between them (P < 0.0001 and P =0.027 respectively (. Renal insufficiency and uncontrolled diabetes were frequent in both two groups and there was no statistically significant different between them.
 Conclusion: Cardiovascular risk factors are frequent between the patients of both two cities. Differences in race; climate and social habits may be the related causes of higher prevalence of hypertension in Ahvaz and dyslipidemia in Kerman.

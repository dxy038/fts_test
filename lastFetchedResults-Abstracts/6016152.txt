Novel and conceptually simple scheduling and routing algorithms are proposed for unstructured (ad hoc) networks. These algorithms are based on an intelligent interference and power management paradigm that borrows notions from successive decoding and cancellation and transmission power control in order to exploit and thereby (or otherwise) suppress interference (thus departing from the "collision-avoidance" objective and its attendant burdens of eliminating hidden nodes) while supporting differential services based on preassigned traffic priorities. The application of the proposed algorithms to quasi-structured networks - where certain nodes may possess additional capabilities and thus alleviate any processing overheads - is also considered

We present a new version of the Merlin optimization package that contains an interface routine enabling the use of Merlin as a non-interactive local optimizer, and a capability to search for the global minimum when the objective function is multimodal. The present package also contains the Merlin Control Language compiler, which previously was distributed as a separate program. Additional features are a new automatic installation procedure and a convenient running script.

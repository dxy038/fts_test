The objective of this collaborative research and educational program development was to adopt advanced engineering problem solving methods to biomedical engineering, and to some aspects of medical science. Specifically, a novel, web-enabled, 3D multimedia low back pain diagnosis approach was developed, following a case-based/problem-based R&amp;D, teaching, learning and assessment methodology created by Dr. Ranky, and then applied to biomedical engineering, and medical science, with the valuable contribution of Dr. Nadler.

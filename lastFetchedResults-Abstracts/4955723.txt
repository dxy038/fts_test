The &#949; constrained method is an algorithm transformation method, which can convert algorithms for unconstrained problems to algorithms for constrained problems using the &#949; level comparison, which compares search points based on the pair of objective value and constraint violation of them. We have proposed the &#949; constrained differential evolution &#949;DE, which is the combination of the &#949; constrained method and differential evolution (DE), and have shown that the &#949;DE can run very fast and can find very high quality solutions. In this study, we propose the &#949; constrained adaptive DE (&#949;ADE), which adopts a new and stable way of controlling the &#949; level and adaptive control of algorithm parameters in DE. The &#949;ADE is very efficient constrained optimization algorithm that can find high-quality solutions in very small number of function evaluations. It is shown that the &#949;ADE can find near optimal solutions stably in about half the number of function evaluations compared with various other methods on well known nonlinear constrained problems.

Objective
This study was undertaken to compare sexual function in sexually active women with urodynamic stress incontinence (USI), detrusor overactivity (DO), and mixed urinary incontinence (MUI).
Study design
We reviewed the medical records of all women evaluated for urinary incontinence (UI) at our institution between March 2003 and August 2004. At the time of initial evaluation, all women completed the short form of the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire (PISQ-12). PISQ-12 scores of age-matched women with urodynamic diagnoses of USI, DO, and MUI were compared. Statistical analysis was performed with 1-way analysis of variance and Ï‡2 contingency table analysis.
Results
Fifty women with USI, 50 with DO, and 48 with MUI were included in this study. Subject demographics were similar among the 3 groups. Mean PISQ-12 scores did not differ significantly among the 3 groups.
Conclusion
Among sexually active women with urinary incontinence, sexual function as assessed by the PISQ-12 does not differ according to type of incontinence.

An algorithm for an energy-efficient communication, the average load distance (ALD) communication, to forward data from sensor to the cluster head in a hierarchal wireless sensor network is proposed. The objective of the ALD is to prolong the network life-time without additional computational overhead. Implementation of the algorithm indicates that the proposed mode can be up to 88% more efficient over direct mode of communication with regard to per-round maximum energy consumption. An application study shows that ALD can save up to 47% of wireless sensor networks operational cost when compared to direct mode transmission.

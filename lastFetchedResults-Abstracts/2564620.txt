LocationRouting problem is an interesting subject in the literature due to its various applications for real world problems. This paper proposes a twoechelon biobjective model under the assumption of characteristics including multi commodity, simultaneous pickup and delivery and soft time windows. The first objective function aims to minimize transportation costs besides location costs, while the second objective function minimizes fuel costs. Various approaches such as robust optimization have been developed in the literature to deal with uncertainty. The proposed model accounts for the uncertainty in customersâ€™ demands in terms of different scenarios and the problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model using probust approach. Finally, a number of sensitivity analysis are conducted by applying the historical data of a spare part distributer company. The results imply that a slight increment in expected cost of system results in decreased scenario costs.

For various technical reasons, cutouts such as holes in thin-walled structures are inevitable and are of significant technical relevance. Unfortunately holes lead to an undesired stress concentration at the hole vicinity and a reduced strength of the structure. Therefore in practice a local reinforcement in the form of a ring is usually applied around the hole. The increasing requirements for modern structures in terms of low weight and high strength lead to the question of an optimal reinforcement design. The present paper addresses the new but well-approved techniques of the use of curved fibre format to determine the aforementioned optimal design of the reinforcement. The optimization of cutouts in laminated composite plates under bi-axial tensile loading conditions has been investigated using two approaches: the finite element and the Rayleighâ€“Ritz method. The used methodology implemented successfully theoretical results based on the complex potential theory. For the considered problems, the proposed methods were shown to successfully produce a constant objective function around the hole boundary under biaxial loading. The optimal reinforcement of holes in laminated composite plates illustrated that the optimum depends on the degree of orthotropy. Significant reduction of stress concentrations were demonstrated. The results obtained illustrate the necessity and usefulness of the applied optimization procedure.

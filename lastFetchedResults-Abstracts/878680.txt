Tehran and Alborz provinces havealways been a destination of manyemigrants from other parts of the country. It is obvious that the region has reached to significant value of activity and communitiesâ€™centralization; therefore,it causes many problems. Due to a distribution pattern of population, allocatingtotal facilities, proficiencies and opportunities and special political, administrative and commercial activities andattracting too many people from other parts of the country, Tehran city has encountered with demographic irregularityofpopulation distribution of its peripheral structure, hence,serious environmental problems like weather and water resources pollution. In this paper it is attempted to perform an experimental approach into cognition of susceptible regions of population establishment and also cognition of sensitive and vulnerable regions in terms of natural causes using GIS software in the mentioned region. The objective is reconnaissance of the regions that have been followed by spatial distribution of activities and communities.Therefore several layers of information have been provided and final sentences based on superposition and analyzing the information layers haveresulted. The results were prioritized in three categories called first, second and third, to establish the communities and activities; this classification shows that extensive regions of study were qualified for the favorable conditions, by adopting regional development macro policies, as extensible regions with acceptable functional roles they could perform in a national scale.Distribution pattern of sensitive and vulnerable regions specify that many of current populated points are located in these regions, and they cause plenty of existing problems. Vice versa, many regions with appropriate condition for establishment are empty and unused due to inattention to the peripheral potentials.

In the early years of energy rebates only the projects which were easily understood were considered as candidates for rebates. These projects included energy efficient motors, lighting replacement, heating and air conditioning and variable speed drives for fans and pumps. Although these projects do offer older paper mills many opportunities they limit the newer facilities. Therefore, the newer mills must investigate energy savings through process and process control improvements. This involves training both the utility and the Public Utility Commission on the process, which is a difficult task. The objective of this paper is to provide a case history of a process control improvement energy savings project. The paper follows the actual steps of the rebate process which resulted in a large rebate from the utility.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

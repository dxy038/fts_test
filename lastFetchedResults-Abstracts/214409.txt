Although various elements of the immune system are involved in detection and elimination of
neoplastic cells, immune surveillance mechanisms are not always successful in eradicating
cancer. Invariant natural killer T cells are potent immunomodulatory lymphocytes that secrete large
amounts of Th-1 and/or Th-2 cytokines in response to glycolipid agonists. The observed role of
invariant natural killer T cells in antitumor immunity in various animal models and the relatively
recent identification and availability of Invariant natural killer T cell glycolipid ligands with
anticancer properties such as Ù„-galactosylceramide have led to several invariant natural killer T
cell-based clinical trials in cancer patients with somewhat promising outcomes. The objective of
this article is to provide a short overview on immunobiology of invariant natural killer T cells
followed by their potential applications in treatment of cancer.

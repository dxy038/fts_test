The objective of this paper is to exchange the position information between pedestrians and their nearby vehicles effectively, in order to protect the pedestrians from serious traffic accidents. We deal with direct communications between pedestrians and vehicles. We call this kind of communications as VPEC (vehicule-pedestrian communications). In this paper, we propose a cooperative reflect transmission scheme which is transmission control protocol using road infrastructure information. This scheme provides real-time communications between vehicles and pedestrian terminals, and enables to save both the transmission capacity and the power consumption of pedestrian terminals. We also show the validity of this scheme in VPEC by experiments with real vehicles.

A summary of previously published technical data is presented with commentary. The purpose is to offer reliable information for use in material selection and cable design in a form which is convenient for reference and use. Since the value of this summary depends upon the quality of the data presented, the most objective sources have been selected. The primary source is the report of EPRI supported work carried out at the IREQ laboratory in Canada [1]. A few results of work by the author are used to fill in for completeness, to facilitate understanding, or when a disagreement exists between other sources [2].

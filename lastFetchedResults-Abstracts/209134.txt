ureterocolic anastomosis.
Patients and Methods:Record of patients having ureterosigmoidostomy between Jan 1997 and Dec 2006 were reviewed. Parameters studied were age, disease entity, postoperative complications, duration of the procedure, and hospital stay.
Results:There were 23 patients with mean age of 42.3 years. Out of these, carcinoma urinary bladder, ectopia vesicae and vesico vaginal fistula were seen in 14, 8 and 1 patients respectively. Mean duration of the procedure was 20.8 minutes, while mean hospital stay was 8.4 days and mean duration of maintenance of rectal tube was 7.13 days. The complications noted were pneumonia (4.35%), wound infection (8.7%), hypokalemia (43.48%), recurrent fever (17.4%) and bilateral hydronephrosis (8.7%).
Conclusion:We have concluded that the procedure is simple, quick and associated with minimal morbidity.

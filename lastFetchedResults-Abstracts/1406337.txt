A novel thickness shear mode (TSM) immunosensor for detection of M. tuberculosis (M. TB) was presented in this paper. Styrene–butadiene–styrene block copolymer was selected as a new membrane material to immobilize antibody. The properties of the membrane, such as lifetime, response speed and the wettability, were studied. Using SBS copolymer-coated quartz crystal, the effective immobilization of antibodies was achieved on the TSM immunosensor surface, and a TSM immunosensor that based on the resonant frequency change was set up. A new method for diagnosis of M. TB was proposed based on this sensor. It was simple, unlabeled and accurate. when used in spike samples, good results were obtained.

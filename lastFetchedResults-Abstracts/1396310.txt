The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of intermittent weldment of cylindrical tubes on the energy absorbing behavior under axial crushing. This paper describes the test results for cylindrical empty and foam-filled tubes and discussions of the improvement of energy absorbing efficiency by the sequential rupture of intermittent weldment. The weldment rupture of a cylindrical foam-filled tube reduces the peak values of crush load and increases the valley values, while the mean crush load is maintained at a similar level as in the fully welded tube. The weldment rupture of a cylindrical foam-filled tube improves the energy-absorbing efficiency by reducing the crush load amplitude without a loss of total energy absorption.

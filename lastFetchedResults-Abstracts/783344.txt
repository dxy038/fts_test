Objective To present 1-month, 12-month
and lifetime prevalence estimates of mood, anxiety
and alcohol disorders in Italy; and the socio-demographic
correlates and comorbidity patterns of these
estimated disorders. Method A representative random
sample of non-institutionalised citizens of Italy
aged 18 or older (N = 4,712) was interviewed between
January 2001 and July 2003, with a weighted response
rate of 71.3%. DSM-IV disorders were assessed by lay
interviewers using Version 3.0 of the Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results A
total of 11% of respondents reported a lifetime history
of any mood disorder, 10.3% any anxiety disorder
and 1.3% any alcohol disorder. About 5%
reported having an anxiety disorder in the past
12 months compared to 3.3% for any mood disorder
and 0.2% for any alcohol disorder. Major depression
and specific phobia were the most common mental
disorders. Women were twice as likely as men to
report a mood disorder and four times as likely as
men to report an anxiety disorder, while men were
twice as likely as women to report an alcohol disorder.
High comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders
was observed. Prevalence estimates were generally
lower than in parallel surveys carried out in other
Western European countries. Conclusion A high
proportion of adults in Italy have a history of mood,
anxiety or alcohol disorders. The lower than expected
prevalence estimate of alcohol use disorder may be
due to under-reporting or to low social harm from
alcohol consumption

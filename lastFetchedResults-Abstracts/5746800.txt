A study was undertaken to assess the impact of employing fuzzy technologies in areas of complex weapon system design. The technology was examined for use in a life-cycle cost exercise with the objective of providing a foundation from which to make service life assessments and recommendations on future weapon systems. The issues associated with this problem can be highly subjective and often exhibit a high degree of functional as well as variable uncertainty, ambiguity and noise. The study demonstrated that there is a potential role for the technology, but only in a hybridized environment, not as a stand-alone solution methodology.

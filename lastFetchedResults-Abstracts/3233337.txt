This paper describes a novel reduced switch count Bidirectional Contactless Charging System (BCCS) suitable for Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) applications. The proposed topology has half the number of switches and diodes compared to the conventional full bridge topology. This results in reduced control complexity, losses and converter cost. The operation and performance of the reduced switch count BCCS topology has been investigated for Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and Grid to Vehicle (G2V) operations. A reduced switch count BCCS scheme has been designed for a 2kW system and is tested by simulation to check its bidirectional power flow functionality.

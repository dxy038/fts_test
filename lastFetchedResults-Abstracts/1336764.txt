Insulin resistance has been detected in obese Morgan horses and it has been suggested that horses of this breed are predisposed to this condition. The objective of this study was to determine whether blood lipid, glucose, and insulin concentrations differed between Morgan horses and Thoroughbreds housed at the same facility. Fourteen Morgan horses (five mares, nine geldings) ranging in age from 4 to 14 years were compared with 21 Thoroughbreds (11 mares, 10 geldings; age range 7â€“20 years) from the same herd. A single blood sample was collected from each horse after grain was withheld overnight. Variables were compared between breed groups and breed-specific reference ranges were calculated. Triglyceride, cholesterol, nonesterified fatty acid, glucose, and insulin concentrations did not differ between breeds of horse in this study. This may be because horses included in this study did not suffer from obesity and were regularly exercised.

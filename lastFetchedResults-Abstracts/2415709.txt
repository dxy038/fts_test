BACKGROUND: The primary objective of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) in
patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is not only to restore
the blood flow in the infarct-related artery, but also to save the patientsâ€™ quality and duration of
their life. Since left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a known predictor of clinical
outcomes in STEMI patients, the possible association between characteristics of a large group of
patients who undergo pPCI with LVEF and death was evaluated.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 304 patients who had undergone pPCI between
2009 and 2011. The association between LVEF and in-hospital outcomes of patients was assessed.
RESULTS: LVEF ? 25%, 25%  <  LVEF  <  50%, and LVEF ? 50% were presented in 23 (7.6%), 150
(49.3%), and 128 (42.1%) of the patients, respectively. Three patients (0.01%) died before
echocardiography. There was no significant difference among aforementioned three groups
regarding baseline characteristics, except age (P = 0.012) and sex (P = 0.016). Cumulative
number of cardiogenic shock and death were 7 (2.3%) and 22 (7.2%), respectively; with
significant differences between three LVEF groups. Age more than 70 years old, pulmonary
edema, systolic blood pressure  <  100 mm Hg, shock, post-PCI thrombolysis in myocardial
infarction (MI) flow grade, corrected thrombolysis in MI frame count, angiographic success and
ST-segment resolution showed significant association with death (P  <  0.050).
CONCLUSION: This study not only demonstrates that LVEF ? 50% is associated with a higher
incidence of in-hospital adverse events, but also identifies characteristics that are strongly
correlated with the risk of LVEF ? 50% and death after pPCI.

The objective of this paper is to develop a high step-up isolated converter with two input power sources. The proposed converter has two input ports for simultaneously converting two different input power sources with low voltages to a stable output power with a high voltage. Moreover, the demand of bidirectional power flow, which is dependent on the power management for charging and discharging power storage mechanisms, can also be satisfied in the proposed converter. According to various situations, the operational states of the proposed converter can be divided into three states, including a stand-alone state, a united power supply state, and a charge and discharge state. The effectiveness of the designed circuit topology is verified by experimental results, and the goals of high-efficiency conversion, high step-up ratio, and bidirectional power flow can be achieved by the proposed converter operation.

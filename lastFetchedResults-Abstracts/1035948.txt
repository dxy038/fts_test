The objective of this paper is to study the influence of cryogenic treatment of pin on load bearing ability of interference fitted assemblies. En8 steel was used to prepare the pin and bush. The pins were soaked in liquid nitrogen (cryogenic temperature) and ice for different time periods. The bushes were heated and then assembled without applying the external pressure. The assemblies were tested for their strength. A comparative study on results of experimental and Lame’s approach has been carried out. The results reveal that assemblies with cryogenically treated pin exhibits higher load bearing ability. The degree of increase in load bearing ability with increase in soaking time at cryogenic temperature is small. The variation in load bearing ability obtained through experimental investigation is in agreement with that of Lame’s approach.

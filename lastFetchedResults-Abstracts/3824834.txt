An automated system presently used by the U. S. Naval Observatory (USNO) for determining, maintaining, and disseminating Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) to a worldwide community of scientific and military users is described and evaluated on the basis of present capabilities and future requirements. The objective of the system is to provide near-real-time dissemination of PTTI information from a Master Clock time scale with a stability in excess of a few parts in 10-14.

Background: Since psychological tests such as questionnaire or drawing tests
are almost qualitative, their results carry a degree of uncertainty and sometimes subjectivity.
The deficiency of all drawing tests is that the assessment is carried out after
drawing the objects and lots of information such as pen angle, speed, curvature and
pressure are missed through the test. In other words, the psychologists cannot assess
their patients while running the tests. One of the famous drawing tests to measure the
degree of Obsession Compulsion Disorder (OCD) is the Bender Gestalt, though its
reliability is not promising.
Objective: The main objective of this study is to make the Bender Gestalt test
quantitative; therefore, an optical pen along with a digital tablet is utilized to preserve
the key drawing features of OCD patients during the test.
Materials and Methods: Among a large population of patients who referred to
a special clinic of OCD, 50 under therapy subjects voluntarily took part in this study. In
contrast, 50 subjects with no sign of OCD performed the test as a control group. This
test contains 9 shapes and the participants were not constraint to draw the shapes in a
certain interval of time; consequently, to classify the stream of feature vectors (samples
through drawing) Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is employed and its flexibility increased
by incorporating the fuzzy technique into its learning scheme.
Results: Applying fuzzy HMM classifier to the data stream of subjects could classify
two groups up to 95.2% accuracy, whereas the results by applying the standard
HMM resulted in 94.5%. In addition, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), as a strong static
classifier, is applied to the features and resulted in 86.6% accuracy.
Conclusion: Applying the pair of T-test to the results implies a significant supremacy
of the fuzzy HMM to the standard HMM and MLP classifiers.

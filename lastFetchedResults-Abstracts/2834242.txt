The main objective of this paper is to introduce a MEMS based device for handwritten digit and hand gesture recognition applications. This MEMS based device consists of triaxial accelerometer, an atmega8 micro controller and a ZigBee wireless transmission module. The accelerometer is used to recognize hand movements. It converts the acceleration signals into analog voltage signals. The analog voltage signals will be converted into digital signals in atmega8 micro controller. The ZigBee module will transmit those signals to personal computer and it will be processed. Finally the digits will be displayed in PC monitor. Hence human computer interaction can be done in an easy manner similar to write in a notebook by using a pen.

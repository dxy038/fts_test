Objective (s): The objective of this study was to translate and to test the reliability and validity of the Persian version of Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19 (MSISQ-19). 
Methods: Using a standard "forward-backward' translation procedure, the English language version of the questionnaire was translated into Persian (Iranian language). Then a sample of 226 women with multiple sclerosis aged 18-65 years completed the questionnaire. To test reliability the internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Validity was evaluated using face validity, content validity, convergent validity and discriminant validity. 
Results: The mean age of respondents was 35.7 (SD=8.07) years. Reliability analysis provided evidence for high internal consistency for the total MSISQ-19 (0.90) and for the primary (0.85), secondary (0.90) and tertiary (0.78) subscales. The MSISQ-19 had convergent validity with measure of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The results from Known groupâ€™s comparison (discriminant validity) indicated that older women with MS were significantly scored higher than younger women and the questionnaire was able to discrimiate these groups as expected. 
Conclusions: In general, the findings suggest that MSISQ-19 is a reliable and valid measure of sexual dysfunction in women with MS.

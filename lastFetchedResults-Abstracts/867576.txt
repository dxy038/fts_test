Deteriorating jobs scheduling has received increasing attention in recent years. However, most
researchers focused on regular criteria such as the makespan, and the total (weighted) completion time.
However, in many real-life situations, early completion of a job is equally undesirable as its late
completion. In such cases, minimizing the quadratic function of job lateness may be an appropriate
objective for the decision makers. Therefore, this paper addresses a single-machine problem where
the objective is to minimize the sum of squares of job lateness under the simple linear deterioration
assumption. A branch-and-bound algorithm and two heuristic algorithms are provided to search for
the optimal solution and the near-optimal solutions, respectively. Computational results are presented
to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

Background: Serum concentrations of antimullerian hormone (AMH) correlate with ovarian response during assisted reproduction treatment (ART) cycles.Objective: This retrospective study attempted to evaluate the selection of ovarian stimulation protocols based on serum AMH levels in patients and its impact on the results of ART.Materials and Methods: Based on AMH levels, the patients with tubal factor infertility were divided in three groups of normal, low and high AMH levels. Oocyte, good embryo number and pregnancy rate in each group were analyzed.Results: Using agonist and antagonist protocols, an increase in serum AMH led to higher number of oocytes and better quality embryos. At all low, normal and high AMH levels, the agonist protocol led to a more significant increase in the number of oocytes than the antagonist protocol (p<0.05). The number of high quality embryos significantly increased by the agonist protocol than antagonist protocol in women with normal AMH levels of 1.3-2.6 ng/ml (p=0.00). Moreover, the results for the number of high quality embryos at AMH ˃2.6 ng/ml was in favor of the antagonist protocol (p=0.00). The results showed the lowest pregnancy rate at AMH ˂1.3 ng/ml. At AMH ˃2.6 ng/ml, there was a significant increase in pregnancy rate through the antagonist protocol (p=0.04).Conclusion: Findings of this study suggested that the ART results are predictable, taking into account the AMH levels. The protocol specific to each patient can be used given the AMH level in each individual. This is because the results of each protocol depend on individual conditions

The factorization properties of polynomials defined over finite integer rings and the associated direct sums are analyzed. The objective is to describe new computationally efficient algorithms for computing one and two dimensional convolution of data sequences defined over finite integer rings. The number theoretic transforms (NTTs) are a special case of the general theory presented

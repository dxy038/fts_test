Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) and Kangwon National University (KNU) ground-based synthetic aperture radar (GB-SAR) team has been developed a fully polarimetric and interferometric GB-SAR system over past several years. The objective of this paper is to investigate an application of the obtained fully polarimetric GB-SAR images and an effective polarimetric analysis method to extract polarization properties from different terrain targets as a preliminary study. We utilized an unsupervised classification method for analyzing of a fully polarimetric GB-SAR image, in particular, Cloude and PottierÂ´s method and a combined H/A/&#945;_ and the complex Wishart classifier method based on the H/A/&#945;_ polarimetric decomposition theorem.

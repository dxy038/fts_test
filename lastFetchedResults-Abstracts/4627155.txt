Up to now, we have seen a great variety of applications of DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) for evaluating the efficiency of many different kinds of activities of organizations called DMU (Decision Making Unit). This study is concerned with efficiency analysis through data produced from a business simulation game. We concentrate on two factors, namely selecting of evaluating item and improving of range for efficiency. The efficient methods to select proper items and improve efficiency range are proposed based on the financial ratio analysis and the sensitivity analysis, respectively. The objective of this study is to propose a method that can make up for shortfalls of conventional financial ratio analysis methods and the DEA model (CCR) with quantitative and non-quantitative data produced from production, sales, financing and other business operations on a business simulation game.

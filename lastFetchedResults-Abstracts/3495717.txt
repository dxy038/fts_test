This paper presents a multiobjective shape optimization of an offset reflector antenna using the Cone of Efficient Directions Algorithm (CEDA), that includes a multiobjective line search. This algorithm features a monotone dominance convergence: the sequence of solution antennas occur in such a way that all the objectives are improved simultaneously. Given an area to be covered, the desired radiation pattern is the one with the maximum mean gain and uniformity, possibly weighted, inside it. These features are achieved by the definition of a single objective function, which must held in three different frequencies (a total of three conflicting objectives), in order to provide broad-band characteristics to the designed antenna

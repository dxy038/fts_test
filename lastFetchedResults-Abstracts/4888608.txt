In this paper we present a green engineering framework for the integrated design of product and processes. The primary objective in green engineering is to eliminate the waste or scrap generated as a result of design and manufacturing decisions if possible, otherwise reduce it to the best possible limits. We present a Physical System Theoretic approach for modelling and analysis of waste generated by jointly considering engineering design and manufacturing issues. A mathematical programming model is developed to concurrently decide the product tolerances and manufacturing technology

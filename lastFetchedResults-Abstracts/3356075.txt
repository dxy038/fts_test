The object of the study was the antenna of fractal geometry for GPS portable terminal. To make an objective assessment of the designed antennas the network and field parameters were determined. The focus was directed toward tuning of the resonant GPS frequency position by means of modification of Minkowski curve geometry. The theoretical analysis, design procedures, as well as the experimental results confirms each other in good agreement.

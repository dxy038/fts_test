The objective of this study is to produce our own experimental data of physical properties of domestic concrete used in Korean NPPs, and to study on the thermal behavior of concrete exposed to high temperature conditions. The compressive strength and chemical composition of the concrete used in the Yonggwang NPP units 3 and 4 were analyzed. The chemical composition of Korean concrete is similar to that of US basaltic concrete. The thermal properties of the concrete, such as density, conductivity, diffusivity, and specific heat were also measured with a wide temperature range of 20–1100 °C. Most thermo-physical properties of concrete decrease with an increase in temperature except for the specific heat, and particularly the conductivity and the diffusivity are a 50% lower at 900 °C as compared with the values at room temperature. The specific heat increases until 500 °C, decreases from 700 to 900 °C, and then increases again when temperature is above 900 °C. In this work, we also have performed CORCON analysis and MCCI experiments to simulate a transient thermal behavior of concrete exposed to high temperature conditions. The measured maximum downward heat flux to the concrete specimen was estimated to be about 2.1 MW m−2 and the maximum erosion rate of the concrete to be 175 cm h−1 with maximum erosion depth of about 2 cm. In the CORCON analysis, it is found that the concrete compositions have an important effect upon concrete erosion.

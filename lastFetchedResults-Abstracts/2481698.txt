<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Background:</strong> The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of cystic echinococcosis (CE) in Qom Province, central Iran using ELISA test.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Methods:</strong> Overall, 1564 serum samples (800 males and 764 females) were collected from selected subjects by randomized cluster sampling in 2011-2012. Sera were analyzed by ELISA test using AgB. Before sampling, a questionnaire was filled out for each case. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression for risk factors analysis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Results:</strong> Seropositivity was 1.6% (25 cases). Males (2.2%) showed significantly more positivity than females (0.9%)<em> </em>(<em>P</em>= 0.03). There was no significant association between CE seropositivity and age group, occupation, and region. Age group of 30-60 years encompassed the highest rate of positivity. The seropositivity of CE was 2.1% and 1.2% for urban and rural cases respectively. Binary logistic regression showed that males were 2.5 times at higher risk for infection than females.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Although seroprevalence of CE is relatively low in Qom Province, yet due to the imporÂ­tance of the disease, all preventive measures should be taken into consideration.</p>

Background and Objective: Lead can cause liver damage in which oxidative stress is involved. Exercise and use of anti-oxidative substances such as anti-oxidative curcumin may stop the production of free radicals. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of endurance training and curcumin against lead toxic effect on hepatic tissue in male rats.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 60 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, control , sham, lead,  exercise + lead,  curcumin+lead and exercise+lead+curcumin (n=10 in each group). The exercise training consisted of 25-64 min of running on an ungraded treadmill at a speed of 15-22 m/min for 8 weeks. Curcumin (30 mg/kg) and lead (20 mg/kg of lead acetate) were administered for 8 weeks, 3 days/week, intraperitoneally. Serum ALT, AST and ALP were measured by colorimetric method. 

Results: The results showed that 8 weeks of lead exposure causes a significant increase of AST and ALT in the lead group as compared to control group (p =0.002, p = 0.007, respectively). Endurance training and curcumin consumption significantly decreased AST and ALT(p =0.041 and  p =0.009, respectively). After endurance training and curcumin consumption, ALP non-significantly decreased (p =0.692).

Conclusion: Regular exercise and curcumin supplement may inhibit
liver damage induced by lead.

The control of the numerical simulation in engineering design constitutes a key factor of competitiveness of the industrial companies. Indeed, it contributes both to the quality of the products but also to the shortening of the cycles of development. For that, in industry, the use of calculation by the designers is more and more developed. The work carried out in the project OSCAR proposes new concepts such as mechanical models, instructional cases and captures of design processes aiming at providing cooperative environment to ensure accurate use and reuse of numerical analysis within early stages of the design processes. The entity simulation goal constitutes one of the key elements of methodology in OSCAR. System Engineering (SE) is a discipline that makes it possible to control the design and the construction of complex sets, fascinating in account all the cycle of life, since the detection of the needs until completion for the withdrawal for service. We propose in this paper, an analysis by retro-engineering of the contributions of an approach of the type system engineering according capitalized in OSCAR, in the objective. is to formalize the simulation goals in coherence with design assistance the tools.

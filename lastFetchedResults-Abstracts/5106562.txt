In inverse electrocardiography (ECG), the problem of finding activation times on the heart noninvasively from body surface potentials is typically formulated as a nonlinear least squares optimization problem. Current solutions rely on iterative algorithms which are sensitive to the presence of local minima. As a result, improved initialization approaches for this problem have been of considerable interest. However, in experiments conducted on a subject with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, we have observed that there may be a mismatch between favorable solutions of the optimization problem and solutions with the desired physiological characteristics. In this work, we use a method based on a convex optimization framework to explore the solution space and analyze whether the optimization criteria target their intended objective.

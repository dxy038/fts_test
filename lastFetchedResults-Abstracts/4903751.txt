The paper presents analysis of distribution system connected with distributed generations. The study addresses aspects related to optimal sizing and location of DG units for losses minimization and voltage stability improvements. Many cases have investigated to highlight the relationship between the optimum size and location for losses minimization and the optimum size and location for stability improvements. The student version of the AMPL software is used in the proposed study. The objective function is formulated with full consideration of both quality and inequality constraints. On the other hand, the stability index criterion is used for calculating the best location and size for system stability improvements. The 90 bus test system from the literature is used for the different studied cases. The results show that calculating minimum system losses is not necessary to achieve coherence improvement for the voltage stability problem.

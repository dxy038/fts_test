This paper proposes two novel stable fuzzy model predictive controllers based on piecewise Lyapunov functions and the min-max optimization of a quasi-worst case infinite horizon objective function. The main idea is to design state feedback control laws that minimize the worst case objective function based on fuzzy model prediction, and thus to obtain the optimal transient control performance, which is of great importance in industrial process control. Moreover, in both of these predictive controllers, piecewise Lyapunov functions have been used in order to reduce the conservatism of those existent predictive controllers based on common Lyapunov functions. It is shown that the asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop discrete-time fuzzy predictive control systems can be established by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, the controller designs of the closed-loop control systems with desired decay rate and input constraints are also considered. Simulations on a numerical example and a highly nonlinear benchmark system are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed fuzzy predictive controllers.

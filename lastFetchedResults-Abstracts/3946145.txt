This study considers the problem of controlling the patient blood gases with the objective of maintaining these blood gases in their physiological ranges during a stable extracorporeal circulation process. It focuses on regulating the arterial partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Two distinct control design schemes are considered. The first scheme is based on H<sub>2</sub> performance and the second scheme is derived from an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> criteria. By incorporating a general dynamic output-feedback controller, LMI-based characterisation of the controller design are established. Using typical case studies, simulation experiments are performed and the ensuing results are analysed and compared.

Hybrid renewable energy system has been introduced as a green and reliable power system for remote areas. There is a steady increase in usage of hybrid renewable energy units and consequently optimization problem solving for this system is a necessity. In recent years, researchers are interested in using multi-objective optimization methods for this issue. Therefore, in the present study, an overview of applied multi-objective methods by using evolutionary algorithms for hybrid renewable energy systems was proposed to help the present and future research works. The result shows that there are a few studies about optimization of many objects in a hybrid system by these algorithms and the most popular applied methods are genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization.

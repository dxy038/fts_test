In this paper, the reconstruction of cylinders with complex media is investigated. The forward scattering problem is first analyzed by using the FD-MEI (finite difference-measured equation of invariance) method, then the objective function is constructed in terms of the difference between the computed scattering fields and the measured fields, and finally the objective function is minimized through the conjugate gradient method (CGM) and variable metric method (VMM). The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by reconstruction examples of a conducting cylinder and a dielectric cylinder, where the reconstruction of a conducting cylinder is based on the real Ipswich data.

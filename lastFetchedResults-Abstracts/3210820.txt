The active research of sequence alignment in the field of Bioinformatics plays an important role in molecular sequence analysis. In cases of pairwise as well as multi-sequence alignment, the objective is to maximize the similarities between the sequences which constitute of residues i.e. nucleotides for DNA/RNA and amino acids for proteins. We have proposed an efficient genetic algorithm based optimized sequence matching method for finding match between two DNA sequences. The process is compared with relevant pairwise sequence alignment techniques.

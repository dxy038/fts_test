Initial results are presented of a two-phase study which addresses the question: What new graphics facilities are needed and how should they be developed for use by future power system dispatchers? A major objective of this study is to identify those emerging visualization and interaction techniques that would provide the greatest benefit to the dispatcher in a future energy management system. This work will form the basis for future standardization of power system application software interfaces and will make use of both existing and emerging graphics, display management, and communication standards

Leucaena is a fast growing, multipurpose tree planted in tropical regions for many uses including forage. Leaf and leaf + stem material were collected from Leucaena species, varieties, and hybrids grown at two sites in Hawaii and in Australia. Neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, crude protein, in-vitro dry matter digestibility, and relative condensed tannin were determined by both laboratory and near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) procedures. The objective was to evaluate the forage quality of the Leucaena material and to determine the feasibility of using NIRS as a reliable means to determine forage values. Considerable variation within forage quality attributes was found among the species, varieties, and hybrids evaluated, indicating the need for careful selection of Leucaena for forage production systems. Laboratory analyses and NIRS estimations of forage quality attributes were highly correlated, suggesting that NIRS analysis should be considered as an efficient tool for Leucaena forage development programs.

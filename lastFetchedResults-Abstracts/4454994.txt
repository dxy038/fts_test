Many nuclear power facilities are finding it economically beneficial to increase reactor output, from operating plants, by resorting to power uprates. A power uprate implies that a utility can increase the reactor output, or the megawatts generated, by increasing steam pressure without adding or changing any plant systems. This is perhaps one of the least expensive options for increasing the generating capacity of a power plant. However, a nuclear plant requires a comprehensive review of the plant systems, structures and components to assure their capability to withstand the resulting increased normal and accident plant conditions. A power uprate will typically result in a plant operating at higher than the originally designed environmental conditions. Safety related equipment in nuclear plants is presently qualified to the UFSAR Chapter 15 accident events and the resulting temperatures, pressures, radiation levels etc. These values will increase when the reactor is producing a higher MWe output. Components that are sensitive to the environment must be re-evaluated and assessed to determine their acceptability and operability under the revised environmental conditions. Most safety-related mechanical and electrical equipment will require an assessment from an environmental qualification standpoint. Utilities must perform this task in a systematic, auditable and cost effective manner to optimize their resources and minimize plant costs associated with modifications, replacements or equipment testing. This paper discusses various approaches and provides recommendations to achieve equipment qualification while satisfying the plantÂ´s objective of a power uprate

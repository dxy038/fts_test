The objective of this tutorial is to describe recent activities carried out in this field especially within the network of excellence SatNEx. In a first part, the temporal behaviour of the propagation channel is addressed thanks to the use of time series synthesisers. In a second part, it is shown how space variation of propagation impairments is described with the development of generators of rain attenuation fields. Then, the hot topic of the space-time variability of the propagation channel is introduced, which is the objective of actual work carried out within SatNEx

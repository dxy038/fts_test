The CCITT has recently finalized a set of five recommendations which will trigger growth for video teleconference (VTC) and videotelephone (VT) services. It is necessary to develop objective measures of VTC/VT picture quality to insure a specifiable quality of service can be delivered to the user community. Measuring motion distortion is particularly important in VTC/VT systems because some degree of visible motion degradation is usually acceptable for most applications. The authors examine the temporal frequency response measurement technique, present objective test data for operational TV systems, and examine the process of correlating objective test data with subjective test results

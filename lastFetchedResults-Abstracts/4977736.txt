In this paper, we propose a robust video super-resolution reconstruction method based on spatial-temporal orientation-adaptive kernel regression. First, we propose a robust registration efficiency model to reflect the temporal information reliability. Second, we propose a spatial-temporal steering kernel considering motions between frames and structures in each low resolution frame. Simulation results demonstrate that our new super-resolution method substantially improves both the subjective quality and objective quality than other resolution enhancement methods.

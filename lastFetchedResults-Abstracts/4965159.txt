Search engines return SERP which contains results to the user query which may be relevant or irrelevant. Some of the results which are not relevant are the matter of great dissatisfaction to the user who queried the Web to look forward for the desired answer. As the WWW is the huge repository of information so there is a necessity of an intuitive approach that can navigate, filter, summarize and manage such a large collection of data.

Objective
Cigarette smoking behavior may be influenced by catechol-O-methlyltransferase (COMT), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and monamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), genes that play roles in dopamine metabolism. The association between common polymorphisms of these genes and smoking behavior was assessed among 10,059 Caucasian volunteers in Washington County, MD in 1989.
Methods

Age-adjusted logistic regression was used to measure the association between variants of these single nucleotide polymorphisms and smoking initiation and persistent smoking.
Results

Overall, no association was seen between each genotype and smoking behavior. However, among younger (< 54 years) women, the COMT GG genotype was positively associated with smoking initiation (OR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0 1.5), and the MAO-A TT genotype was inversely associated with persistent smoking (OR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.4, 1.0). Men who smoked fewer than 10 cigarettes per day were more likely to be persistent smokers if they had the COMT GG (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.9) or the DBH GG (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.5) genotypes.
Conclusion

Overall the results of this large community-based study do not provide evidence to support the presence of important associations between variants of COMT, DBH, or MAO-A and smoking initiation or persistent smoking.

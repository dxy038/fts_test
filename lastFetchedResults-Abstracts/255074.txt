Forecasters need climatological forecasting tools because of limitations of numerical
weather prediction models. In this article, using Finnish SYNOP observations and ERA-40 model
reanalysis data, low visibility cases are studied using subjective and objective analysis techniques. For the
objective analysis, we used an AutoClass clustering algorithm, concentrating on three Finnish airports,
namely, the Rovaniemi in northern Finland, Kauhava in western Finland, and Maarianhamina in
southwest Finland. These airports represent different climatological conditions. Results suggested that
combining of subjective analysis with an objective analysis, e.g., clustering algorithms such as the
AutoClass method, can be used to construct climatological guides for forecasters. Some higher level
subjective ‘‘meta-clustering’’ was used to make the results physically more reasonable and easier to
interpret by the forecasters.

Crops freeze injury is one of the most happened disasters when season turns. In recent years, the products of crops in china frequently suffer from freeze injury greatly and the trend is gradually increasing. The great influence of freeze injury in large areas has earned peopleÂ´s highly attention. Remote sensing technologies have many advantages such as being objective, macroscopic and timely, which make it suitable for freeze injury monitoring. This paper introduced the development of remote sensing based crops freeze injury monitoring, summarized and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of vegetation index difference method, temperature retrieval method, cold valley area method, target reading and high spectral analysis methods. Based on existing research experience of remote sensing technologies in freeze injury monitoring, some existing problems and future research topics are discussed.

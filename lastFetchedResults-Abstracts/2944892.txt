We formulate and solve a multimodel &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> adaptive control problem. In this problem, the unknown plant is one of a finite number of possible models. The control objective is to find an adaptive (possibly nonlinear and time-varying) controller that achieves an &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> bound on the closed-loop transfer function for all possible plants. We present an exact solution for the optimal adaptive controller in two cases: (a) the plants are static, but possibly nonlinear, functions, and (b) the plants are linear time-invariant (LTI)

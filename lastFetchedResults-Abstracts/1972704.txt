The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in raw milk samples from 18 dairy farms in the Yangtze River Delta region during four different seasons. A total of 72 tank milk samples was collected with 18 samples for each season. Milk AFM1 was detected using LC-MS/MS. The AFM1 was detected in 43 milk samples (59.7%) ranging in concentration from 10 to 420 ng/L. The concentration of AFM1 in raw milk was significantly higher during the winter (123 ng/L) than during other seasons (P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between the spring (29.1 ng/L), summer (31.9 ng/L), and autumn (31.6 ng/L) (P &gt; 0.05) seasons. This indicates that raw milk collected during the winter is at high risk for AFM1 and that seasonal factors should be considered for the management of aflatoxins in both the feed and milk.

Objective and subjective impairments in a displayed colour picture can be evaluated accurately by analysing the component colour video signals. Objective noise performance of component colour video signals in a TV monitor is investigated. This analysis takes in to account the effect of nonlinearity of the display tube. The impairment in the displayed picture is a function of the magnitude and spectra of the input noise. Two commonly occurring noise spectra are considered. They are triangular (deemphasised), and white noise

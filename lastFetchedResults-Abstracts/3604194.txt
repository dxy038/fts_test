For the first time, the adjoint network method, which is well known in the area of circuit theory, is applied directly to the full wave model of microwave circuits. In this manner, the gradient of the objective function, which depends on all geometrical parameters of the microwave structure, is computed by just one full wave analysis, thus reducing dramatically the computational effort required by the optimization.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

To solve the problem of security evaluation of e-commerce system, this paper builds the guideline of E-commerce system security evaluation from the management and technology perspective, and presents the basic optimal nodes-based evaluation model as well. Next, based on the rough set theory and methods, this paper investigates the attributes reduction algorithm for e-commerce system security evaluation decision system, and takes advantages of the heuristic algorithm to obtain the reasonable and usable reduction results, which can make the evaluation results of e-commerce system security more objective and optimal. Finally, the efficacy and usability and of our approach is demonstrated by examples.

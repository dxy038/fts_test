All design unit consists of smaller functional blocks called subsystems or module. For effective functioning of the system these modules need to be in sync with each other and share re-sources. Problem starts when one subsystem follows different protocol as others. Each module has its different bit rate or baud rate of data transfer which can be either asynchronous or synchronous. The paper describes an architecture which defines how to transfer the data from one protocol to another protocol. It exploits the flexible protocols of I2C which makes it compatible with APB AMBA protocol. The proposed architecture is a bridge between I2C Master and APB Salve and can transfer data from I2C supported module to APB supported module and vice-versa. The data travels from a serial bus (I2C) to parallel bus (APB) to serial (I2C) in sync with the respective domain clock. This forms a bidirectional interface between I2C supported module and APB supported module.

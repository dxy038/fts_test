This paper reviews the evolution of video quality measurement techniques and their current state of the art. We start with subjective experiments and then discuss the various types of objective metrics and their uses. We also introduce V-Factor, a "hybrid" metric using both transport- and bitstream information. Finally, we summarize the main standardization activities, such as the work of the video quality experts group (VQEG), and we take a look at emerging trends in quality measurement, including image preference, visual attention, and audiovisual quality.

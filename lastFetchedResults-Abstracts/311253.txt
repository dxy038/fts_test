Objective. To establish the gait adaptations of patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency during stair ascent.

Design. Joint kinematics and kinetics during stair climbing were measured in both knees of normal subjects and unilateral anterior cruciate ligament deficient patients.

Background. As there is limited research pertaining to activities other than level walking, the purpose of the current study was to elucidate the gait of patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency during stair climbing to determine the effects of the deficiency on knee joint motion and moments as compared with normal knee function.

Methods. A motion analysis system was used to measure and calculate kinematic and kinetic data for six normal subjects and nine patients with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament deficiency during stair ascent on a specially constructed staircase. Left and right leg data were analysed to reveal between-limb differences for each subject.

Results. Patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency displayed a significant (P<0.05) reduction of up to 50% in peak knee flexion moments in their involved knee. In the present study where a step height of 15.5 cm was used, peak flexion moments in all subjects' limbs occurred at knee flexion angles of about 40Â° during single limb support.

Conclusion. The current study showed that most patients with an anterior cruciate deficient knee adapted their gait during stair ascent.

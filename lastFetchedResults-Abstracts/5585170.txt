Accident hazard control is the main objective of safety management activities of water conservancy and hydropower engineering. This paper is starting analysis from water conservancy and hydropower engineering hazards. After defining the definition, classification and characteristics of that, this paper puts forward the construction principle of safety management process of water conservancy and hydropower engineering based on hazards, and proposes evolutionary model and implementation phase of safety management process, studies how human factor, dynamic factor and behavior factor such key elements pose an impact on improving effect, and put forwards specific countermeasures of strengthen the practice and improvement in the safety management process of water conservancy and hydropower engineering.

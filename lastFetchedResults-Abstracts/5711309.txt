This paper mainly studies that the steady state of a bidirectional high-frequency isolated dual active bridge DC-DC converter and according to its small-signal model, a feedback system based on a 10KW DC-DC converter will be designed. The proposed converter topology with numerous advantages and the utilization of a high-frequency isolated transformer is suitable for high-power-density and high-power applications. In order to make it easy for obtaining desired output voltage with high accuracy and a large compensator will be designed and a simulation will validate the analysis.

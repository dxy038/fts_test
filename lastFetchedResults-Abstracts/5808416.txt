This paper presents a control approach for human grasp simulation in a real-time context. We consider a 12-dof hand grasping quasi-rigid objects, either for fine manipulation or perturbation rejection. The objective is to translate and rotate the object with respect to non-sliding conditions. In order to improve the visual realism and the stability of the simulation, we use a locally deformable model on fingertips with friction. The resolution of contact forces is used for controlling the system with a set of 23 muscles. This paper presents also a new technique for solving the grasping force optimization problem, allowing real time simulation. This work is part of a virtual human project and combines robotic control experiments and theoretical laws of deformations in a global simulation

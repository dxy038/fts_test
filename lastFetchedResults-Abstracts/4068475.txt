The objective of this paper is to study the impact of advanced physical layer techniques on the maximum achievable throughput of wireless multihop mesh networks. We formulate a cross-layer optimization framework for the routing and scheduling problem jointly with the following physical layer techniques: successive interference cancellation, superposition coding, dirty-paper coding and their combinations. In the case when each node is enabled with superposition coding, we need to formulate a power allocation subproblem for the optimal power partition of the superimposed signals. We solve these joint problems exactly to compute the maximum achievable throughput in realistic size networks. This allows us to quantify the performance gains obtained by using these techniques (and their combinations). Specifically, we find that the use of dirty-paper coding (only at the gateway) is not justified in networks with mixed uplink and downlink flows. On the other hand, the combination of superposition coding with successive interference outperforms significantly other techniques across all transmission power range for both uplink and downlink flows. We also provide a number of interesting practical insights on throughput improvement by comparing different combinations of these techniques.

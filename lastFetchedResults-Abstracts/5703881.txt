There are endogenous rules in terms of the formation and development of the scale of the power supply and distribution market. The scale of power market expands from small region to large region, the whole nation and even larger following the evolution process of market space self-organization. Power supply and distribution market is an open and dynamic system, in constant exchanges of various materials, energy and information with the external environment. Driven by efficiency, resources are flowing within and out of the power supply and distribution market. Power market is driven from equilibrium by the following variables: the high time coordination of generation, transmission, distribution, sales in the power system; the space differences in terms of regional power sources structure, power grid structure, and load characteristic. In addition, there is significant non-linear feature and significant fluctuation caused frequent price fluctuations the constitutive parts and among different stages of the power supply and distribution market. These objective external determinants enable the power market to form the dissipative structure and with the ability to self-organized expansion. Based on dissipative structure theory and methodology and through qualitative analyses and quantitative modeling, the essay reveals that the power market scale evolution follows market self-organization mechanism of dissipative structure. Afterwards, the essay goes on to propose the necessary and effective measures, derived from dissipative structure theory, to the evolution of power supply and distribution market.

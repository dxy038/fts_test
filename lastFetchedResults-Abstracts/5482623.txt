Grid Service Agents for Real Time Traffic Synchronization is proposed in this research. The paper presents Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) problem and its synchronization property. For such a complex problem, using grid computing with multi-agent coordination and negotiation techniques to improve ATFM computational efficiency is the main objective of actual even further research. To demonstrate the developed model - Air Traffic Flow Management in Grid Computing (ATFMGC), the grid architecture, the basic components and relationships among them are described. At the same time, the function of agents, their knowledge representation and inference processes are also discussed. As an example, a tactical planning case study related with some Brazilian airports is illustrated.

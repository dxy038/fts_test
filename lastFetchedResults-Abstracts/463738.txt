OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to characterize breast-feeding initiation and the duration of breast-feeding in women receiving antiepileptics.
STUDY DESIGN: A cohort study was performed on 34 pregnant epileptic women receiving antiepileptics and 34 pregnant age-matched controls.
RESULTS: Fifty percent of the group receiving antiepileptics chose breast-feeding as the initial feeding method, which was significantly less than the controls (85%, p = 0.004). The decision to choose initial feeding methods was closely associated with advice from physicians and other sources. The 17 women in the antiepileptics group who chose breast-feeding initially terminated breast-feeding significantly earlier than did the control group (4.7 ± 2.6 vs 9.3 ± 5.7 months post partum, p< 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Mothers receiving antiepileptics tend to choose formula feeding. Even when they choose breast-feeding initially, its duration is shorter than usual. Consensus and guidelines on this matter among experts remain to be reflected on and effectively implemented in current medical practice.

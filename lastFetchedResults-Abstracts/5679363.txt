A very simple particle swarm optimization iterative algorithm is presented, with just one equation and one social/confidence parameter. We define a &#8220;no-hope&#8221; convergence criterion and a &#8220;rehope&#8221; method so that, from time to time, the swarm re-initializes its position, according to some gradient estimations of the objective function and to the previous re-initialization (it means it has a kind of very rudimentary memory). We then study two different cases, a quite &#8220;easy&#8221; one (the Alpine function) and a &#8220;difficult&#8221; one (the Banana function), but both just in dimension two. The process is improved by taking into account the swarm gravity center (the &#8220;queen&#8221;) and the results are good enough so that it is certainly worthwhile trying the method on more complex problems

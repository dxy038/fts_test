The increasing popularity of using general purpose networks for real-time communication generates a number of issues which need to be analyzed. This paper has the objective of evaluating some of the solutions proposed in this specific research area and emphasizing their most important advantages and drawbacks. Moreover, a model is proposed as a solution for IP network bandwidth estimation in the case of periodic real-time traffic. We used this model for simulations in purpose of revealing the behavior of periodic real-time traffic on IP networks.

The objective of this paper is four-fold: (1) to develop mathematical models for uplink and downlink radio frequency interferences for three-dimensional elliptical-orbit satellites; (2) to formulate geometric criteria for determining all possible interference scenarios; (3) to simulate developed models with a sample communication network system; and (4) to compute the interference durations. Mathematical framework and numerical results will be presented. The model will be used to simulate and extract statistical information from the analyses of the simulation to predict the mean RFI duration, i.e., the time between RFI occurrences, and the fraction of time that RFI occurs. These parameters are essential to communication system designs such as frequency and orbit planning, assigning, scheduling.

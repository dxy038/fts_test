Wave buoy has been more widely applied in the ocean measuring field, and the bidirectional communication between the wave buoy and the data center has become a hot area of research. The communication system transmits signal securely and effectively to the upper computer system for our references, and concurrently, accurately executes commands from upper computer system on lower computer system. Based on the GPRS wireless technology and took SCM as the core of whole system, this paper designs the lower computer system and completes the bidirectional communication. The SCM not only sends the digital voltage data acquired and packaged after A/D conversion, but also accepts the commands from upper computer system to control and set the work pattern. By analyzing system, this design possesses a good feasibility, great transmission efficiency, little professional maintain, and less cost.

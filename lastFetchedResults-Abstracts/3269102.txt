The objective of this research is to demonstrate that combined wind and hydro generation, each dispatchable, can operate as firmed capacity in a market with transmission constraints. The model network consists of other generators and loads at different buses. The wind and hydro generators offer an hourly wind-hydro load schedule (W-H schedule) for supply into an auction based market with other generators offering to meet the system loads in a transmission constrained dispatch. An algorithm is presented that determines the operating strategy 24 hours ahead of real-time operations, with the objective of minimizing the total cost of supply while respecting the given W-H schedule, nodal power balance constraint, generation limits, branch flow and other limits. Discussion is based on New Zealand Electricity Market rules, where generators are self-committed into the market. Three scenarios are studied and the results presented.

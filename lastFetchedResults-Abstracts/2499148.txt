<p><strong>Background and Objective: </strong>The outer membrane protein W (<em>ompW</em>) of <em>Vibrio cholerae </em>is involved in stimulating the im- mune response via induction of protective immunity. It also plays an important role in bacterial pathogenesis by increasing the adaptability of pathogenic strains. In this study we aimed to clone <em>V. cholerae ompW </em>gene in the strain <em>X-33 of Pichia pastoris.<br /></em><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>A gene encoding <em>ompW </em>was cloned into the Ppicza vector downstream of alcohol oxidase promoter. Then recombinant vector was transformed into the genome of the strain X-33 of <em>P. pastoris</em>. After growth of zeocin-resistant transformants, clones were selected and subsequently confirmed for cloning by PCR enzymatic digestion and sequencing<em>. <br /></em><strong>Results: </strong>PCR, enzymatic digestion and sequencing showed that the <em>ompW </em>gene was correctly cloned into <em>P. pastoris </em>ge- nome.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Results of our study showed that the methylotrophic yeast <em>P. pastoris </em>can be considered as an appropriate host instead of mammalian and prokaryotic systems for cloning of <em>ompW</em>. As far as data show, this is the first time that <em>ompW </em>of <em>V. cholera </em>is cloned into the methylotrophic <em>P. pastoris.</em></p>

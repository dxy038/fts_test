The article discusses the problem of theoretical choice of the optimal shape of extrusion die and extrusion ratio during the extrusion process of aluminium rods copper cladded with the help of the explosive method to join the core and the coat. Mathematical model of extrusion process based on finite elements method was worked out to attaining the objective. The model makes it possible to carry out the analysis of mechanical state (stress and strain) on the boundary of layers for the sake of main parameters of the process. Optimal values of process parameters were obtained basing on the mathematical analysis for bimetallic rod with outer diameter 18 mm and copper layer thickness 2 mm.

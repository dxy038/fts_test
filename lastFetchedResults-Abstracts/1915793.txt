
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nanotechnology is the science that today is considered by many researchers and different industries. The produced nanostructures with this science despite several advantages are the main concern of researchers because of their harmful and toxic effects. In this study the effect of silver nanoparticles on the hormones LH, FSH and testosterone in male rats was investigated and it is hoped with observing the obtained results, to find ways to prevent from entry of nanoparticles into the human body. 
METHODS: In this study, silver nanoparticles with doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight were orally administered for 28 days to 50 male rats in five groups of 10. Then blood samples were taken from rats. Hormonal tests of LH and FSH were performed by DIAPLUS Inc kit and hormonal test of testosterone was performed by DRG instruments kit and the groups were compared.
FINDINGS: In this study any significant changes were not observed in the mentioned hormonal concentration up to 100 mg dose of silver nanoparticles. But significant changes in testosterone concentration (reduced concentration) in high doses, i.e. 200 mg (1.8±0.5 nmol/L vs. 2.5±0.6 nmol/L) were observed that could be due to inhibition effect of silver nanoparticles on the function of testosterone-producing cells (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that silver nanoparticles changes the LH, FSH and testosterone hormones rate in male rats that this can lead to interference in the metabolism and liver renal failure.

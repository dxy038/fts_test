New concepts such as the functional separation of call control from bearer control have been applied in the design of signalling protocols for B-ISDN, in order to support advanced multiparty multimedia communications in a flexible and efficient manner. This results in a need for a new set of performance measures to describe the network performance objective of the B-ISDN signalling network. This paper addresses issues in the development of performance parameters for the B-ISDN signalling network. Based on a new message flow model, we propose an approach to excluding user-response times from the overall processing delay of a confirmed service request, in a multiparty communication environment

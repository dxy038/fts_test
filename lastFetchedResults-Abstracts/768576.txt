Remyelination, the process by which new myelin sheaths are restored to demyelinated axons, represents one of
the most compelling examples of adult multipotent progenitor cells contributing to regeneration of the injured
central nervous system (CNS). This process can occur with remarkable efficiency in both clinical disease, such as multiple
sclerosis, and in experimental models, revealing an impressive ability of the adult CNS to repair itself. However,
the inconsistency of remyelination in multiple sclerosis, and the loss of axonal integrity that results from its
failure, makes enhancement of remyelination an important therapeutic objective. Identifying potential targets will
depend on a detailed understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of remyelination. In this article we
address two important issues. First, we consider the nature of the cell or cells that respond to demyelination and
generate new oligodendrocytes, identifying current areas of uncertainty and addressing the role of adult CNS stem
and progenitor cells. Second, we discuss the concept of adult progenitor activation following demyelination, focusing
on the increased expression of (1) olig transcription factors, (2) bone morphogenetic proteins and (3) fyn, a
member of the src-family of tyrosine kinases.

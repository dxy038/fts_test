Reduction of the initial and maintenance costs of the metering equipment required for the measurement of kilovolt-ampere demand has been an objective of the metering industry for many years. The development of a method of measuring polyphase ampere demand has made possible a simple and compact meter which registers kilowatt-hours and indicates maximum ampere demand. A good approximation of true kilovolt-amperes demand is then obtained by multiplying this maximum ampere demand by an assumed base voltage.

With the rapid development of science and technology, and the improvement of production safety and management standards, the use of expert system to bridge crane operator teaching simulation to train high quality personnel has become a pressing need. But it is hard to evaluate the train result. This paper aims at developing a bridge crane training system based expert system. The system includes some modules which are the friendly graphical user interface, knowledge base and so on. Through the expert system, the training system can train and test skill of the operators safely and efficiently. Under the management of the expert system, the examination will be objective and justice. So the paper introduces the method to develop the expert system.

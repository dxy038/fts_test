We present a novel approach used in conjunction with Sugeno and Yasukawa qualitative modeling algorithm. Its main feature is a reduction of the output space before the output data are clustered. The data used in this paper come from nine diesel engine trucks, and for each diesel engine 13 sensor variables are measured. The objective is to develop a fuzzy model for predicting the remaining lifetime of a diesel engine.

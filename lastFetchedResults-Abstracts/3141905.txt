In this paper we discuss the problem of degree reduction of disk Be&#769;zier curves. We propose an efficient method to solve this problem. The method transforms multiple objectives optimal into a single objective optimal, and then discrete optimal function over interval. Genetic Algorithm is used to solve this nonlinear discrete problem for finding an optimal approximation to the center curve of the original disk Be&#769;zier curve and the radius of the degree reduced disk Be&#769;zier curve. Finally, we give example to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

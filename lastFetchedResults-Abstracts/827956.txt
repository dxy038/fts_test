The objective of this study is to validate a finite element analysis (FEA) simulation methodology to predict the out-of-plane behavior of piping elbows. Two out-of-plane elbow experiments and the corresponding FEA shell and elbow element models are presented. For load–displacements results, all the FEA predictions showed excellent agreement with measured experimental results, and for load–strain behavior, the shell FEA model results correlated quite well with the experimental results.

Worldwide, the technological change of Analog Television into Terrestrial Digital Television started since 1998. ItÂ´s an inevitable change that each country has to face and which is part of the digitizing process that already has taken place in many other technologies. In order to determine the most convenient standard for Cuba, and technological infrastructure planning, it was necessary to take into account several aspects, particular technological issues. This paper comprises the evaluation of reception quality parameters for DTMB digital television signal broadcasting standard, with 6MHz bandwidth. DTMB has been adopted after more than ten years of work conducted by a Technical Committee created with this purpose. All the experiments have been carried out according to the UIT-R BT.2035-2 report: &#8220;Guidelines and techniques for the evaluation of digital terrestrial television broadcasting systems including assessment of their coverage areas&#8221;. The objective of Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting (DTTB) testing and trials is to evaluate the performance of an available system in a variety of transmission configurations and reception conditions. These tests include measurements of receiver performance in the presence of Random Noise, RF signal level Variation (Dynamic Range) and Static Multipath Interference.

The need of fully proving high voltage and high power circuit breakers is brought into evidence; to achieve this objective suitable synthetic circuits have to be provided which not only can correctly simulate the breaking operations but also the making operation under short circuit, autoreclosing. Two new synthetic making circuits which can easily be combined with the existing widely known synthetic circuits for breaking tests {1} {2} {3} have been studied theoretically and developed in an industrial laboratory. Suitable testing procedures and these circuits lead to a solution which is technically correct and cheap, and is applicable to any type of high voltage circuit breaker fitted or not fitted with making and breaking resistors.

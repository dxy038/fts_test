This paper presents a single-phase rectifier with power factor correction. The full-bridge converter is used in this circuit to perform bidirectional power flow capability. A novel control scheme based on grey prediction method is used to improve the system transient response. Two control loops are adopted in the system to obtain a constant DC bus voltage and achieve line current tracking. In the transient response, the grey prediction compensator can improve the system settle time and overshoot problems. Based on the adopted control scheme, the sinusoidal line current, the unity power factor and less steady state error on the DC bus are obtained. The computer simulations and experiments based on a laboratory prototype are provided to verify the effectiveness and validity of the proposed control scheme. It is shown that the measured harmonic currents and input power factor satisfy the international standard requirements.

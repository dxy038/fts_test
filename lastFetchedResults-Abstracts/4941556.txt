Contra pose the character of scheduling problem in the aluminum industry, a virtual enterprise is abstracted in this paper. The VE substitute manufacturing techniques. A model of scheduling system during aluminum industry is also established based on a Multi-agent theory. As a foundation we will study the system model concerning every agentÂ´s working mechanism and the mechanism of corresponding with each other among agents. This model totally separates the two hierarchies, virtual enterprise level and leaguer level. This hierarchy is propitious to realize a perfect collocation of resource in the whole aluminum industry; it has preferable flexibility and expansibility. To achieve the production of aluminum industry optimal scheduling, lay the foundation for achieving the objective of decreasing energy consumption and optimal scheduling in the aluminum industry.

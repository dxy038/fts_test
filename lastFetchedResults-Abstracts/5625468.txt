This paper illustrates the issue of traffic variable routing in Satellite-HAP system networks with multicasting capabilities. The proposed routing technique includes the joint utilization and delay metrics as the two major criteria affecting the QOS. Due to the induction of traffic utilization into consideration, the system encounters route oscillations which are affecting the system QOS. The performance of the proposed system has been improved using new cognitive routing with the objective of making the routing decision based on the long term changes, rather than inducing short term traffic load oscillations. The system performance has been evaluated and compared using three different smoothing functions. The new proposed routing techniques help to suppress the route oscillations and accelerate reaching the system steady state.

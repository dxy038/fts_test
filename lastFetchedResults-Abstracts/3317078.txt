The objective of this paper is to investigate a control method for systems with discrete inputs that have switch related cost. For such systems, the control objective often is a trade off between the deviation from the reference (performance) and the number of switches (weariness, energy efficiency etc.). For such systems a steady state might never be attained, but rather the optimal behavior might be constituted by a limit cycle. In this paper we consider the problem of finding and controlling the system towards an optimal limit cycle. A low complexity approach will be proposed.

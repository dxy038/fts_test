In this work, we develop a formalism based on test construction by the eval-UAM tool. This process aims to improve the quality of the assessment process by taking into account the relevance of the items. The method uses students´ answers to follow different paths to improve the accuracy of the assessment process. By using this method, we improve the objectiveness and take into account the relevance of the subject contents. The method also includes a complete analysis of the individual items that, for example, can be used to discriminate the ones that are not correctly formulated or, alternatively, to detect subjects that are not correctly explained to the students in the learning process. The method is implemented in the e-valUAM application and can be directly used in computer-assisted tests for different subjects and disciplines, or as a self-evaluation tool with the objective of correcting students´ deficiencies in the learning process.

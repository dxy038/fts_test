It not only establishes the mathematical model of vehicle power train, adopted to deal with the constraint condition and objective functions. But also optimizes the parameters of power train by the way of Fuzzy mathematics and Fuzzy optimization method. The calculation of case study and simulation shows that it is significant to improve the whole performance to optimize and analyze the vehicle power train by the method.

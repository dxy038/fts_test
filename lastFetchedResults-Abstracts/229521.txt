Physically based rendering needs numerical models from real measurements, or analytical models from material
definitions, of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). However, measured BRDF data sets
are too large and provide no functionalities to be practically used in Monte Carlo path tracing algorithms. In
this paper, we present a wavelet-based generic BRDF model suitable for both physical analysis and path tracing.
The model is based on the separation of spectral and geometrical aspect of the BRDF and allows a compact and
efficient representation of isotropic, anisotropic and/or spectral BRDFs. After a brief survey of BRDF and wavelet
theory, we present our software architecture for generic wavelet transform and how to use it to model BRDFs.
Then, modelling results are presented on real and virtual BRDF measurements. Finally, we show how to exploit
the multiresolution property of the wavelet encoding to reduce the variance by importance sampling in a path
tracing algorithm.

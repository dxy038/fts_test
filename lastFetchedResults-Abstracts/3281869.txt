Concerning the human factor and ergonomics in an active orthosis for lower limbs application, it is important to generate an anthropomorphic gait. The objective of this work is to find an anthropomorphic gait model using Principal Component Analysis able to be used in a real orthosis application. The gait was modeled from the perspective of the joint leg angles. In order to find a model close to the human gait behavior, gait experiments from humans were collected. The straight line slow walk was selected to be modeled because it fits the basic walk for an orthosis. The validity of the proposed model was verified through extrapolation and comparison with real human gait cycles, different from the ones used to build the model.

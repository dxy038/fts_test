REMPARK project objective is to develop a personal health system with closed loop detection, response and action capabilities for the assessment and possible management of ParkinsonÂ´s Disease (PD) patients. The project is developing a wearable monitoring system able to identify in real time the motor status of the PD patients and evaluating ON/OFF/Dyskinesia status with a very high sensitivity and specificity degree (&gt;80%) in operation during ambulatory conditions. Identification of the motor status is based on the knowledge included in a large database obtained with the collaboration of a number of volunteer PD patients, according a specific defined protocol in ambulatory conditions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are applied to the database information for the automatic detection of motor symptoms.

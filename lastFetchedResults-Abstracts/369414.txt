The microbond test, a single fiber shear test, has been adapted to be a microshear test for the measurement of the adhesion of resin-based dental materials to dentin and enamel. The objective of this study is to improve the design of this microshear test so that it can provide accurate and reliable shear bond strength data. In the current design of the microshear test apparatus, the bonding diameters of the specimens have been as small as 0.70 mm. The smaller diameters give researchers the ability to test several bonded specimens on one flat dentin or enamel surface, thus allowing both for the regional mapping of the mineralized surface and the conservation of extracted teeth needed to provide the necessary substrates. The test configuration used in earlier studies has been modified through finite element analysis to address concerns in the test methodology. The results of this study show that the microshear bond test can be a useful tool in helping to understand the complex interactions that occur at the interface between dental composites and dentin and/or enamel surfaces, especially at interfacial sites not amenable to macroshear testing.

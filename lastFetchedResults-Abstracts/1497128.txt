Taiwan is a subtropical island nation with high dependence upon imported energy, about 97% of its energy is supplied by imported fuels. Environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are becoming significant issues in Taiwan. In this regard, renewable energy like bio-gas energy, wind energy and solar energy are thus becoming attractive because the Energy Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other government energy expenditures pledged about annual US$ 100 millions in total to promote renewable energy and energy conservation based on the renewable energy development policy approved by the Executive Yuan (Cabinet) in January 2002. Also, the Taiwan government announced the ambitious target to achieve about 6500 MW of energy from renewable sources by 2020, which is equivalent to increase Taiwan’s installed capacity of power supply from renewable sources to above 10%. The objective of this paper is to present an updated overview of energy policy from renewable sources in Taiwan, including the government’s organizational response and special funds for supporting renewable energy promotion and technology development. Then, current status of usage and technology development of renewable energy is further addressed in this paper, concentrating on biomass energy, solar energy and wind power. Finally, the paper will focus on some integrated research and development programs to promote renewable energy technology, and summarize two research projects of biofuel energy (i.e. bio-hydrogen production and fast pyrolysis technology from organic wastes) in progress under the joint-funds of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Science Council.

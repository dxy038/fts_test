We constructed and interfaced an actuator/sensor to a game of pong to produce highly motivating rehabilitation for persons with arms partially paralyzed from a stroke. In addition to moving the pong paddle the subjectÂ´s motions can be recorded to provide objective measures of improvement in movement range, accuracy, and dynamics. A preliminary patient study revealed a high level of patient interest and satisfaction. Even patients who had no familiarity with computers (the prototype is connected to a computer) and approached the system with trepidation, were soon interested and involved. One hemiparetic aged man initially refused to use the system because he did not think his arm could perform the task, but after a short session in which he performed well, he asked if he could take it home. Patients get very involved and show a high level of concentration.

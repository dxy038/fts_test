Continuous rolling of plate and strip is a typical complex, multi-variable and multi-objective system, which has shown the characteristics such as complication, large-scale and close coupling increasingly. Therefore, it has become more and more difficult to design complex industrial control systems. This paper describes a multi-agent control system for a strip rolling process. In order to realize the distributed and intelligent control of the system, after analyzing the characteristics and structure of this control system, the multi-agent theory was applied and then a control strategy was designed based on multi-agent interaction. Finally, the partition method, the coordination mechanism, and the model structure of the multi-Agent control system for the strip rolling process were analyzed. This paper concludes with a new control structure and system for strip rolling process, which helps to build up the generally integrated model, to eliminate the coupling among control systems, and to realize more intelligent control.

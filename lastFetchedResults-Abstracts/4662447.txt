Active queue management (AQM) is a key congestion control scheme for reducing packet loss and improving network utilization in TCP/IP networks. This paper proposes a hybrid intelligent proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller as an active queue manager for Internet routers. This paper deals with hybrid system (GA-BF) based on the conventional GA (Genetic Algorithm) and BF (Bacterial Foraging) which is social foraging behavior of bacteria. A hybrid (GA-BF) is employed to derive optimal or near optimal PID controller gains such that an objective function of step response characteristicÂ´s parameter is minimized, and thereby a stable queue length, low packet loss, and high link utilization for TCP networks are guaranteed. The performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated in various network scenarios via a series of numerical simulations.

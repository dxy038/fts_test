In this paper we present a new alternative for routing with quality of service (QoS) problem solution in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN). This problem has the especial attribute of including multiple objectives which are conflicting between them. A mathematical model is proposed for this problem and includes QoS parameters such as bandwidth, packet loss rates, delay and power consumption. The classical approximations consist in optimizing a single objective or QoS parameter, however doesnÂ´t take into account the conflicting nature of this parameters leading to suboptimal solutions. In this work is proposed the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA), particularly NSGA II which allow finding an optimal solution taking into account all the objectives as QoS parameters.

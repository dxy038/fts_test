A class of impulsive control systems with time-varying delays is considered. By establishing an impulsive delay differential inequality, we analyze the global exponential stability of the impulsive delay systems and estimate the exponential convergence rate. On the basis of the analysis, a design procedure of impulsive controller is presented. The designed impulsive controller not only can globally exponentially stabilize the time delay systems, but also can control the exponential convergence rate of the systems. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

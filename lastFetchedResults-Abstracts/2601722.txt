Tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases during the history of humans&amp;rsquo; life, various societies always have been trying to control and struggle against this disease. Tuberculosis could be controlled by Kochs discovery of the tubercle bacillus as etiologic agent and the discovery of Bacillus Calmette&amp;ndash;Gu&amp;eacute;rin (BCG) vaccine all around the world. In fact, it had been assumed Tuberculosis could ultimately be eradicated, however any possible global control of tuberculosis will be destroyed in the near future because of the existence of tolerant strains, the worldwide distribution of the disease, as well as the emergence of the AIDS epidemic. The fact that onethird of the worlds population is infected with Tuberculosis which can consider as a reservoir of infection. This issue has become even more complicated now since nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is indistinguishable than tuberculous mycobacteria because they are environmental organisms which present in all places and cause lung diseases and tuberculosis. Therefore, the laboratories diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB Laboratories) play a key role in diagnosing, monitoring and control of tuberculosis by providing prompt and reliable laboratory results, which can be the guidance clinical for control of tuberculosis. The aim of this research is a review of some scientific works (achievements) in relation to the quality and performance of TB Laboratories. As the researchers in the field of tuberculosis laboratories believe that increasing the capacity of laboratories using trained staff, implementation of quality control of equipment and procedures, can enhance the quality and accuracy of laboratory results. Generally, by creating a System National Administration for diagnostic laboratories, TB can be more effectively controlled.

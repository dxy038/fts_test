The aim of this paper is to identify, correct and explain the glaring errors and mistakes to be found in al-Furati's Arabic translation and interpretation of the "Gulistan of Sadi", named "Rawdat al-ward".
As will be seen, al-Furati's translation has led to a number of infelicities all of which constitute the topic of my investigation. This study confines itself to an in-depth and objective analysis of those couplets and hemistiches which happen to have been misinterpreted by the translator.

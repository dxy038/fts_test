The objective of this research is to explore the spatial correlation between impervious surface, green space and urban heat island based on a case study of Nanjing, China. The Landsat TM image was used to retrieve land surface temperature. According to the impervious surface area (ISA) and the fractional vegetation cover (Fr) having an inversely relation in urban built-up areas, the spatial pattern of the impervious surface area was obtained. By calculating of the three optimum bands, the image was classified and urban green space was extracted. And then we researched the relationship between impervious surface area, the area of green space, the shape index of green space and land surface temperature in urban built-up area. In addition, through multivariable linear regression, the comprehensive regression was gained.

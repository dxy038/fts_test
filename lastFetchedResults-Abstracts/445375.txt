Purpose:

The objective of this study was to reduce the number of operative reports assigned to the surgical residents but not dictated within 48 hours by 80% within 6 months.

Methods: A before-after trial was conducted in a teaching hospital (part of a major academic medical center) in an urban setting, of a complex intervention based on a theoretical framework for behavioral change. Data were collected for more than 6 months before the intervention, and then in three separate time periods during the next 18 months. The intervention, lasting 41 weeks, and directed specifically at undictated operative reports, comprised the following: educational sessions, posting of residents’ names with delinquency rates, attending/resident interactions, telephone reminders, rewards, and punishments. The population studied comprised every resident who rotated through the general surgery service over a 2-year period 1995 to 1997.

Results: The mean (±SD) number of undictated operative reports declined progressively from 72 (±8.3) to 6 (±2.6). This 92% reduction was statistically significant (P <0.00005). The mean number of undictated discharge summaries declined progressively from 54 (±11.2) to 13 (±8.1). This 76% reduction was also statistically significant (P <0.00005). There was a close correlation between the operative reports and the discharge summaries (r = 0.82).

Conclusions: The performance of residents on the surgical service in respect to operative report dictation can be profoundly influenced by a carefully targeted set of interventions based on behavioral theory. The improved performance can be maintained with simple reminders and the halo effect of the intervention extends to the dictation of discharge summaries.

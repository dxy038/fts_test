In this paper, an efficient QoS aware resource allocation algorithm is proposed for wireless relay networks. This algorithm is yielded by considering G/G/1 queue for each subcarrier and using effective capacity concept to model the transmission delay in wireless relay networks. The objective is to minimize the transmission power considering support of QoS parameters. The constant user arrival rate is assumed throughout the paper. An extended Kalman filter also is used to estimate the residual times and vacation times of the relays and subcarriers. Based on the channel state information and queue state information, proposed algorithm assigns proper subcarriers to the relays. Then, the optimum subcarriers and relays are allocated for optimum power efficient transmission to the users.

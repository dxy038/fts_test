Organizations always look for sovereign solutions not only for developing the internal structure of their information systems, but also for integrating and cooperating dynamically their applications. In this context, companies have been aware about the importance of the service orientation in their solutions, in terms of standardization and facility of communication and composition of services from different platforms. However, this technology has limitations, notably, towards methods and approaches used for developing and implementing a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) within enterprises. We talk basically about the lack of efficient and complete approaches used to develop SOA-based systems. Thus, there are many approaches which do not consider the use of a strategic method for identifying services. This leads the developers to a major difficulty of defining the concept service, especially the aspect of functional (service) granularity, and that influences the performance of the system. The objective of this paper is to propose an approach for developing an SOA, based on hierarchical models for specifying Fractal components, in which we highlight the advantages of using the important features of the Fractal components; its distributed and autonomous behavior. In addition to these objectives, we aim to facilitate the implementation and deployment of Service-Oriented Architecture model which is considered necessary for companies. We use to validate our approach, a case study of a commercial company that produces machine tools.

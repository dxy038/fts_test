In order to coordinate and give full play to the multi-function of TCSC, the improved analysis hierarchy process (IAHP) is proposed to determine optimal installation location of TCSC. This method is the organic combination of fuzzy mathematics, AHP and multi-objective decision theory. Firstly, the triangle fuzzy number based on AHP is used to fuzzy the elements of judgment matrix. Secondly, the traditional AHP principles are only used to confirm the relationships between target level and criteria level, while the criteria level weights are determined by calculating the comprehensive important degree. Finally, the best solution is chosen by distance method and nearness principle. The simulation results show that the proposed method including qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis can guarantee result calculated is more reasonable and objective, and formula obtained by the method is simple and normal. Thus, the proposed method can satisfy the requirements of power system on practical application.

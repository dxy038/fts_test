Field repair service is the major part of field service, and it is well known that field repair cost is a vast amount of money. Minimal field repair cost is particularly critical to competitiveness of an electronic company. Exploiting the multi-objective analysis, this paper presents a weight-based repair policy (WBRP) design for electronic systems. Key to the WBRP system is to use productÂ´s status as a guide for performing maintenance tasks. A simulation model and test runs over a field service compatible environment demonstrate the potential effectiveness of WBRP to support field service operations

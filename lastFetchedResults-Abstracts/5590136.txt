The primary objective of this paper was to examine the extent to which Gutman´s Means-End Chain Model can be used to describe the influences given to the choice of characteristics used in software evaluation. This objective was accomplished by developing a theoretical model for software evaluation based on Gutman´s Model, and empirically testing the model with quantitative techniques. The study utilized commercial Australian companies and involved a survey of 403 subjects, which were then analyzed quantitatively with bi-variate analysis. Results of the quantitative analysis provided a number of important insights and suggest several conclusions. The quantitative study showed that strong relationships between the characteristics and the values, affected by the use of the software, exist. The study also showed that desired consequences are related to both characteristics and values. The results provide a number of important insights and suggest several conclusions. The study showed (1) that there is support for applying Gutman´s Means-end chain model in software evaluation; (2) that non-ISO9126 characteristics are also important for software evaluation; (3) that the characteristic, consequence, value relationship can be valuable to benefit the Goal Question Metric model.

The objective of this paper is to study the issue of the projection discrepancy along the line of Liu (2002) and Fang and Qin (2005) based on discrete discrepancy measure proposed in Qin and Fang (2004), which has wide application to the field of fractional factorials. Here we also study the projection properties for q-level factorials and provide connection between minimum projection uniformity and other optimality criteria. A lower bound to projection discrepancy for q-level factorials is presented here.

Background
Two million Americans acquire an infection in the hospital each year, resulting in an estimated 88,000 patient deaths per year.
Objective

Our objective was to describe our initial experience using an animated geographic information system (GIS) to investigate factors associated with nosocomial transmission of resistant organisms. We used a descriptive study at a university-affiliated, county, teaching hospital. We studied all patients and nursing staff on 4 adult, general medicine wards from June through August 2004.
Results

We developed and implemented GIS software. GIS-generated animations demonstrated inappropriate patient placement for 19% of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus and insufficient time for hand hygiene in 14% (6248) of health care provider-patient contacts.
Conclusion

Animated GIS can uncover previously hidden factors that contribute to the spread of nosocomial infections. This technology may become a useful adjunct for the prevention of nosocomial transmission of infectious agents.

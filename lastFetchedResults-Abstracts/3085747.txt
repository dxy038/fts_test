Objective video quality metrics reported in the literature have so far been focused on TV signals with large frame sizes, full TV frame rates, and high compressed bit rates. The aim of this paper is to provide an analysis of 4 objective video quality metrics tested on low bit rate videos with small frame sizes, various frame rates, and low bit rates. The video quality metrics used were the NTIA video quality metric, modified WatsonÂ´s digital video quality metric, video structural similarity metric, and the perceptual video quality metric. The test videos consist of H.264 compressed videos with CIF and QCIF frame sizes, at various bit rates (24 kbps - 384 kbps) and frame rates (7.5 fps - 30 fps). Here, results and analysis derived from the comparison of the metrics are provided.

We consider the problem of determining the disassembly schedules of used products while satisfying the demand of their parts/components over a planning horizon. The case of multiple product types with parts commonality is considered for the objective of minimizing the sum of setup, disassembly operation, and inventory holding costs. A heuristic algorithm is proposed using the linear programming relaxation approach. Test results of the case study on the data obtained from a disassembly shop show that the heuristic algorithm suggested in this paper works well for practical problems.

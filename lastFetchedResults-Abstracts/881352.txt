ABSTRACT: Understanding meanings and the truth of the verses of Noble Quran has long received attention of Quran researchers, and they have always endeavored to discover the truth and essence of its verses. As philosophy of revelation of Quran is to bring to full perfection, which is Liqa’ Allah (the meeting with god), and which is said to be possible through total subordination to god, and knowledge of god is the integral means of Liqa’ Allah, and human is incapable of knowledge of god, therefore, human knowledge of god, as human is required to obtain, is in fact knowledge of names of Allah. Names of Allah are distinct from god; inerrant Imams are names of Allah, and means of invoking god. On the other hand, the acceptance of any deed is said to be conditional on knowledge of names of Allah, this is the only way for worship and knowledge of god, and knowledge of the truth of Quran is dependent on knowledge of inerrant Imams. It is therefore concluded that the main objective of Quran is guiding towards Imam. Quran and Imam are inseparable, and such guidance is found in many points of Quran, this is the very truth which is beyond signification, and on which statements of Quran including decree, sermon, and word of wisdom rely. This truth in found in all verses, whether unambiguous (muhkam) or allegorical (mutashabeh), and god expressed them in words to make them relatively more perceivable to our mind.

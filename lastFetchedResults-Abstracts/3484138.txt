A digital TV system is necessary for not only video and audio, but also data processing. Especially in the case of bidirectional broadcasting, it should manage the return channel created by the Internet, PSTN, and so on. Because of many functionalities and multitasking jobs, it needs an operating system. Embedded Linux, as open source program can increase cost effectiveness in the market and has many advantages-reusable device drivers and application programs, more convenient development environment using shell and file system, and easy resolution of problem within the open source community. In this paper, we modified the embedded Linux kernel and the cross development environment for a big-endian system, redesigned device drivers for kernel execution, and configured system memory map in order to load the Linux kernel. Also we developed a device driver for the entire system control.

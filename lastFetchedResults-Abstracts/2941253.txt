A study on electrical power usage in the Shell Canada Limited oilfield located near Midale, Saskatchewan, Canada, was initiated in May 1994. This was a four month project undertaken by the author, a summer student working with Shell. The main objective of the study was to reduce the electrical costs incurred in operating the oilfield. This was achieved by determining the current electrical costs in the field, comparing these costs with the electrical costs of the adjacent oilfield near Weyburn (operated by PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. or PCP) and sharing practices in electrical usage to try to explain the differences in electrical costs. The result of this work was a recommended action plan which Shell could use to reduce the electrical costs in Midale by an estimated 8% or $120000 a year

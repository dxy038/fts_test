This paper describes an electrical design optimization methodology for a high-speed point-to-point source-synchronous simultaneous bidirectional interface. These physical links are typically used to interconnect multiple processor subsystems to build symmetric multi-processor (SMP) systems, as well as to connect input/output (I/O) subsystems across relatively long distances. Major design issues such as attenuation, crosstalk, delay skew, impedance control and inter-symbol interference (ISI) are discussed for long and parallel external interconnections

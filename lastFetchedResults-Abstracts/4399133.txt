For hybrid AC/DC distribution system, original multi-period optimization model is no longer appropriate. This paper firstly summarizes the model of converter, DC link, step voltage regulator (SVR), and static Var compensator (SVC). Then minimizing the daily energy loss and the number of switching operations of SVRs is considered as the objective function, and a multi-period optimization model for hybrid AC/DC distribution system is established by integrating constraints of converters and DC links in the form of equality and inequality constraints. The proposed problem is solved by the two-stage approach. The feasibility of the proposed optimization model has been demonstrated on a hybrid AC/DC distribution system.

This paper reports the initial steps of research on planning of rural networks for MV and LV. In this paper, two different cases are studied. In the first case, 100 loads are distributed uniformly on a 100 km transmission line in a distribution network and in the second case, the load structure become closer to the rural situation. In case 2, 21 loads are located in a distribution system so that their distance is increasing, distance between load 1 and 2 is 3 km, between 2 and 3 is 6 km, etc). These two models to some extent represent the distribution system in urban and rural areas, respectively. The objective function for the design of the optimal system consists of three main parts: cost of transformers, and MV and LV conductors. The bus voltage is expressed as a constraint and should be maintained within a standard level, rising or falling by no more than 5%.

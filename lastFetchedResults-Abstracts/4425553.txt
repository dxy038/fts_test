With the continuous development of data mining technology, the applications of data mining and data analysis on all walks of life have achieved good results. As for the field of education, data is mainly collected from questionnaire or test scores. While with the flourishing of web-based education systems, E-learning has become one of the most important parts in digital life. These systems accumulate a vast amount of information which is very valuable to analyze students´ behavior and to assist authors in detecting possible errors, shortcomings and improvements. Therefore, if adopting data mining technology to E-learning system, it will be helpful to make learning more efficient. This paper presents a Neural Network (NN) approach for classifying students in order to predict their final grades based on features extracted from logged data in an web-based education system. Our final objective is to timely provide appropriate learning intervention to promote students´ better achievements according to the results of classification.

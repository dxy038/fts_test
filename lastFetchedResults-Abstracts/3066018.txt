In this paper we present a novel parameter estimator that follows a general perception law as an objective function, the Helmoltz principle. We present an interpretation of this postulate in statistical terms and apply it along with low order statistics in order to obtain a flexible parameter estimator with a high breakdown point, capable of suiting the specific needs of each problem. The performance of the algorithm is tested applying the estimator to find lines in synthetic data with up to 90% of noise and real LADAR images.

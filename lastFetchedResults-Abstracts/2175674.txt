Acrylamide is a chemical found in starchy foods that have been cooked at high temperatures. These include crisps, chips, bread and crisp breads. It was first discovered by scientists in Sweden in 2002. The Objective of this study is to determine the level of acrylamide in popular Iranian brands of potato crisps and corn products, produced by domestic food industrial factories. For this reason 7 brands of potato and 8 brands of corn products (10 each) were collected, crashed and after preparing the extracts of each sample, using LC–MS–MS spectrometry for measuring acrylamide amount. Results showed that in different brands of potato and corn products there were different amounts (244–1688 μg/kg) and (&lt;30–410 μg/kg) of acrylamide, respectively. As acrylamide is a dangerous toxin for human health, so it needs to reduce the level of acrylamide in these products that are used extensively by people specially children.

Background: Barberry (Berberris vulgaris) is a well known medicinal plant in Iran and has also been used as food. Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate antihistaminic and anticholinergic activity of methanolic extract of barberry fruit. Methods: Methanolic extract was prepared and pharmacologically studied on isolated guinea- pig ileum, dose- response curves of histamine and acetylcholine with and without methanolic extract were plotted. Results: The pA2 values for antihistaminic activity of methanolic extract and dexchlorpheniramine were calculated (extract; pA2± S.E.M = 3.53 ± 0.16 [-logC(g/l)]; dexchlorpheniramine; pA2 ± S.E.M.= 9.36 ± 0.14 ([-logC (M)]) and compared with each other. The pA2 values of anticholinergic activity of methanolic extract and atropine were also calculated (extract; p^2± S.E.M = 4.18 ± 0.17 [-logC(g/i)]; atropine, PA +S.E.M = 8.99 ± 0.13 [-logC(M)]) and compared. Conclusion: The results indicated antihistaminic and anticholinergic activity of methanolic extract.

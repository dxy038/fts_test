This paper presents the results of a research project whose objective is to extend obtained capabilities of a resilient microgrid to a conventional distribution network. This system has been previously sized and optimized to fully operate in an autonomous way. The presented work is an advanced interface control system for grid connection of this cluster in order to provide the over power in compliance with the distribution network. As a result, the distribution system operator considers this locally controlled cluster as a single producer.

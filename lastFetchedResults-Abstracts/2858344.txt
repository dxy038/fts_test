The rapid increase in energy consumption of data centers accelerates the development of metrics for measuring data center energy efficiency. In response to this demand, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC39 is developing ISO/IEC 30134 series standards defining multiple key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring data center resource efficiency. However, there is another emerging demand to observe the overall trend of all KPIs in a single view and the inter-relationship among the KPIs. The main objective of this paper is to describe the general holistic investigation method and identify issues associated with various strategies. Then it proposes a control chart-based holistic investigation method for resource efficiency evaluation and interrelationship identification of data center multiple KPIs. Through the SWOT analysis on the holistic investigation method presented in this paper, the usefulness and applicability of holistic investigation method are discussed.

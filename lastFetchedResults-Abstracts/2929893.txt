A Monte Carlo canopy reflectance model for predicting canopy bidirectional reflectance is coupled to a forest ecosystem dynamics succession model. The combined models are being applied to forest canopies in order to train a back propagation artificial neural network to extract underlying canopy biophysical attributes or forest succession stage. Validation of the modeling approach and neural network inversion performance is carried out for field data collected at the Northern Experimental Forest study site near Howland, Maine, the location of a NASA sponsored Forest Ecosystem Dynamics Multi-sensor Aircraft Campaign

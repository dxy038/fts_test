This paper explores the scheduling of hydroelectric station during the flood season when the flood is hard to predict. Specifically, how to regulate the capacity of reservoir during the flood season to decrease the loss and maintain the generation efficiency from hydroelectric station will be elaborated in present work. In order to achieve this objective, online algorithm will be applied here to analyze optimal strategy, which manages the reservoir scheduling in terms of online strategy and competitive analysis. We give the online strategy LLS-algorithm with a competitive ratio c<sub>LLS</sub>, and analyze the properties of algorithms. Then the evidences from Ankang reservoir are collected to test the competitive ratio of online strategy. The LLS-algorithm effectively reduces the total loss of hydroelectric station during flood season. The model and results of the study have guiding significance and reference value for decision makers facing the similar situation.

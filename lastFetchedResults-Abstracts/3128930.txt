In order to reduce accident and enhance reliability of system, a new safety assessment approach combining with system safety engineering, factor analysis and neural network is proposed for transmission grid system in this paper. The safety assessment objective architecture was established by analyzing a variety of factors affecting transmission grid system safety using system safety principle. Factor analysis is used to simplify assessment objective architecture with less index variable to reflect most of the original data information. Neural network is applied to model nonlinear and expert assessment rules of overall operational process of transmission grid system. This new approach can reduce the number of evaluation indexes, low the subjectivity of traditional assessment methods and improve the objective and effectiveness. Finally, the effectiveness and availability of the proposed approach was testified successfully to a practical process of State Grid Corporation.

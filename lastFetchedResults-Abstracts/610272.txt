The objective of this project is to compare growth and survival rate in Chinese carps reared under traditional culture conditions versus those reared in ponds treated with slurry (anaerobic fermented  of cow manure). This experiment was conducted using two treatments; one treatment using slurry and the other using cow manure plus chemical fertilizer as the control with three replicates for each. Chinese carp were stocked at the density of 2375 individuals/ha ( Silver carp 60%, Bighead 15%, common carp 17% and grass carp 8%). In this investigation common carp and grass carp were fed with formulated diets and fresh grass, respectively. The survival rate in the slurry treatment was higher than that in traditional treatment. Survival rates were 98, 100, 84 and 52 percent for silver carp, bighead, common carp and grass carp, respectively in the slurry treated ponds and 96.0, 98.3, 82.8 and 20.0% percent in the control ponds. The results showed that survival rate and yields were higher in the slurry treated ponds than that in the control. The increasing percent of yield were 13.5, 2.6, 18.4 and 85.3 in silver carp, bighead, common carp and grass carp, respectively. The survival rate for grass carp was two times higher in the slurry treatment than control. Zooplankton abundance in slurry ponds was higher than that in control, but blue-green algae density in slurry treated ponds was less than (over 50%). In general the results indicate that slurry with higher nutritional content is more effective on the survival and growth rate of fishes and also is more efficient in the proliferation of plankton in particular zooplankton.

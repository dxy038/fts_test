Objective A large representative sample of
early adolescents in the Netherlands was investigated
to assess mental health problems in a school survey.
These results were compared to results from former
household surveys. In addition, several socio-demographic
determinants were analysed. Method A
random sample of schools in the Netherlands was
approached for participation in the Health Behaviour
in School-aged Children Survey study (response rate at
school level, 60% in primary education and 45% in
secondary education). Within schools, a random selection
of classes from the schools participated in the
study (response rate within schools >95%). We analysed
the percentage of children scoring in the problem
range on each of the syndromes of the Youth Self
Report and compared these to the percentages found
in a former population study. The impact of several
socio-demographic background variables was assessed.
Results Approximately 20% of the boys and
23% of the girls have total problem scores in the
problem range. These percentages are much higher
than those found in population studies in the Netherlands
so far, particularly in girls. In multivariate
analyses, gender, socio-economic status and family
composition were found to be of influence. Migrant
status does not appear to be of importance once
other background variables are taken into account.
Conclusions In school surveys on mental health problems,
higher problem rates may be found than in
population surveys conducted in household settings.
This effect has seldom been discussed. It is suggested
that this survey context has to be taken into account
more explicitly when comparing results of surveys.

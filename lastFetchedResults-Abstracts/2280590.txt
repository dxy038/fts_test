The main objective of the current research was to study and model the air drying kinetics of yellow squat lobster (Cervimunida johni) fishery waste. This study was carried out at temperatures from 50 to 90 °C, using five empirical equations (Newton, Henderson–Pabis, Modified Page, Wang–Singh) and a new model proposed in this study. The kinetic parameters ki = 1, 2, …, 5, for each model were temperature-dependent as evaluated using an Arrhenius-type equation. The empirical parameters ni = 1, 2, …, 4, did not show temperature dependence. The fit quality of models on experimental data were evaluated using three statistical tests, sum square errors, root mean square errors, and Chi-square. When comparing the experimental values with the calculated values, it was shown that the Modified Page equation presented the best fit quality, and represented an excellent tool for estimating the drying time of this material, thus leading to the first stage in the development and use of yellow squat lobster waste as a by-product of fishery for animal feed.

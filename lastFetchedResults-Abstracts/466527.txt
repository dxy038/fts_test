Objective: To compare tolterodine with oxybutynin in treatment of urge incontinence. Study Design: A systematic review, following Cochrane methods, was performed to retrieve results of randomized trials that compared tolterodine with oxybutynin in adults with urge incontinence. Composite point estimates of efficacy (episodes of incontinence per 24-hour period, frequency, and voided volume) and safety (dry mouth, withdrawal, and dose modification) were calculated. Results: Four studies were included. Both drugs similarly decreased the number of micturitions in a 24-hour period. Oxybutynin was marginally superior to tolterodine in decreasing the number of incontinent episodes in a 24-hour period (weighted mean difference, 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04 to 0.77) and increasing the mean voided volume per micturition (8.24 mL; 95% CI, 14.19 to 3.38). Fewer patients had dry mouth (relative risk, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.61) and withdrew from the study because of side effects (relative risk, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.88) with tolterodine. Conclusions: Oxybutynin and tolterodine share a clinically similar efficacy profile (although oxybutynin is statistically superior), but tolterodine is better tolerated and leads to fewer withdrawals as a result of adverse events.

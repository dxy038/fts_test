BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are three sensitive cells with a few basal cells in the rat tongue (dark cell I, light cells II and III). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different concentrations of phosphate on the rate of acid phosphatase in taste bud cells in papilla of rat tongue.
METHODS: To determine the influence of phosphorus on acid phosphatase in taste buds, the dose of 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 6 percent and control group of NaH2PO4, 2H20 in the drinking water were used for 30 days then all rats were killed, and their tongues were isolated for histological examination. Black granules in the papillary cells (cytoplasm) of rat taste buds due to plumbsulfhydril from the phosphorus and acid phosphatase with staining region were counted. Gomori's staining method and counting black granules were statistically analyzed with non parametrical of Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA.
FINDINGS: Based on salts were used in the water; there was a linear relationship between the concentration of salt and the rate of acid phosphotase. It was seen a significant difference in mean of black granules in taste bud cells in five different groups of food phosphorus (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: There is a direct relationship between the concentrations of salt in the drinking water with the granules in the taste bud cells.

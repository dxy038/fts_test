Study Objective:
To develop a protocol for emergency department microlaparoscopy with conscious sedation in adolescents with clinically suspected pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of microlaparoscopy in this population.
Design:
Prospective study involving adolescents and young adults age 13 to 24 meeting clinical criteria for uncomplicated PID. Laparoscopy subjects underwent microlaparoscopy in the Children's Hospital Emergency Department (ED) and comparison subjects were admitted for treatment of PID. Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U tests, Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, and repeated measures of analysis of variance (MANOVA) were used for analysis.
Results:
Twenty-four patients were enrolled: 6 laparoscopy subjects and 18 comparison subjects. Laparoscopy and comparison subjects did not differ with respect to age, mean white blood cell (WBC) count, mean temperature, or mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Mean surgical induction time was 13.5 minutes, operative time 19.0 minutes, and total procedure time 32.5 minutes. Mean requirement for midazolam was 2.8 mg and for fentanyl 225 Î¼g. Pain assessment over the first 90 minutes did not differ significantly between laparoscopy and comparison subjects. Four of 6 laparoscopy subjects (67%) and 10 of 18 comparison subjects (56%) were diagnosed with PID (p = NS).
Conclusions:
ED microlaparoscopy appears to be feasible, safe, and well tolerated in this small sample of adolescents and young adults with suspected PID.

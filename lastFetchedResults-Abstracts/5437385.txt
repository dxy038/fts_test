In this paper, we propose a novel framework for proportional fair scheduling in wireless communications. Our framework includes a new definition of generalized proportional fairness, new objective function, and definition of degree of fairness which is widely applicable and has the ability of controlling the degree of fairness. We illustrate application of our framework to the CDMA downlink and provide simulation results

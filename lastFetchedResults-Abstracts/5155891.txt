Recently, parallel optical interconnect (POI) prototypes and products have been designed to meet short distance (&lt;200 meters) computer system and telecommunications switch system applications with low cost as a paramount objective. Optoelectronic chips and optical components were chosen for ease in packaging. This paper will describe the chips, packaging, cabling, design and testing tools, and system level testbeds developed for two of these projects: Jitney and OETC.

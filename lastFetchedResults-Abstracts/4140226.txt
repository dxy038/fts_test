Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming (MBF) can greatly increase the signal gain and reduce the effects of multipath fading for cell-edge users. The objective of this work is to investigate the impact of co-channel unequal-power MIMO interferers on an MBF desired receiver under realistic propagation conditions, including path-loss and Rayleigh fading. Two major contributions are made in this work: i) for the co-channel interference term in the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) expressions, a closed-form expression of the probability density function (PDF) is derived; ii) for the desired signal term, a simple approximation is proposed. Moreover, closed-form PDF expressions for the SIRs are obtained for some special cases. Simulation results verify the validity of the theoretical analyses.

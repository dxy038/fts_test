Objective
The purpose of this study was to identify factors that predict a decision to interrupt a pregnancy in which there are fetal anomalies in the second trimester.
Study design
The New Jersey Fetal Abnormalities Registry prospectively recruits and collects information on pregnancies (≥15 weeks of gestation) from New Jersey residents in whom a fetal structural anomaly has been suspected by maternal-fetal medicine specialists. Enrolled pregnancies that have major fetal structural abnormalities identified from 15 to 23 weeks of gestation were included. Outcomes were classified as either elective interruption or a natural pregnancy course, which might include a spontaneous fetal death or live birth. Predictors of elective interruption of pregnancy were examined with univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses.
Results
Of the 97 cases, 33% of the women (n = 32) interrupted the pregnancy. Significant variables in the regression model that were associated with a decision to interrupt a pregnancy were earlier identification of fetal anomalies (19.0 ± 2 weeks of gestation vs 20.5 ± 2 weeks of gestation; P = .003), the presence of multiple anomalies (78% [25/32] vs 52% [33/63]; P = .01], and a presumption of lethality (56% [18/32] vs 14% [9/65]; P = .0001). These variables corresponded to an odds ratio for pregnancy interruption of 4.2 (95% CI, 1.0, 17.0) for multiple anomalies, 0.8 (95% CI, 0.7, 1.0) for each week of advancing gestational age, and 36.1 (95% CI, 2.9, 450.7) for presumed lethal abnormalities.
Conclusion
Early diagnosis, the identification of multiple abnormalities, and an assessment of likely lethality of fetal anomalies are important factors for the optimization of parental autonomy in deciding pregnancy management.

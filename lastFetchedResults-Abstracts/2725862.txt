This paper proposes a practical solution of high-frequency-link (HFL) ac solid-state transformer (ACSST) based on advanced components in hybrid microgrid. In the proposed solution, all the power devices are SiC power devices produced commercially; all the HF magnetic components are made of iron-based nanocrystalline soft magnetic material; the high-voltage grid interface adopts multilevel cascade structure; the isolated bidirectional dc/dc converter employs dual-phase-shift control to decrease circulating current and increase efficiency; the HF isolated unit is responsible to control voltage and power balancing to avoid control coupling. The configuration, operation principle, intelligent control and management strategy, and hardware design and implement solution of the proposed HFL ACSST are analyzed. Finally, comprehensive experiments verify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed solution.

In terms of weighted scale-free networksÂ´ properties, this paper proposes edges immunization based on discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm. We translate the virus immunization problem to a multi-objective optimization problem in this paper. After a set of edges are immunized, the network is divided into sub-networks whose nodes strength and average path length are as small as possible. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm has a higher spread threshold and better performance than the traditional immunization strategies.

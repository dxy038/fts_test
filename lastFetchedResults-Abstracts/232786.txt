Conversion of lignocellulosic material to monomeric sugars and finally ethanol must be performed at low cost, i.e. with limited consumption of chemicals, yeast and enzymes while still reaching high yields, if it is to compete with other fuel conversion processes. The objective of this study was thus to investigate ethanol production from steam-pretreated wheat straw by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The concentration of sulphuric acid in the impregnation liquid prior to pretreatment was kept low, 0.2%, and SSF was performed at low enzyme loadings, 3–14 FPU g−1 water-insoluble solids (WIS), and a low yeast concentration, 2 g L−1. The pretreatment conditions were optimised to give the highest overall glucose and xylose recovery after enzymatic hydrolysis of the residual WIS. The highest recovery of glucose (102%) and xylose (96%) was obtained after pretreatment at 190 °C for 10 min. Achieving high yields of glucose and xylose with the same pretreatment conditions is unusual and makes wheat straw a highly suitable raw material for bioethanol production. SSF was performed on whole slurry from straw pretreated under the optimal conditions. A high overall ethanol yield, 67% of the theoretical based on glucose in the raw material, was obtained.

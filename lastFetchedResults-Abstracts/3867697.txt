Traditionally, prototype-based fuzzy clustering algorithms such as the Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm have been used to find &#8220;compact&#8221; or &#8220;filled&#8221; clusters. Recently, there have been attempts to generalize such algorithms to the case of hollow or &#8220;shell-like&#8221; clusters, i.e., clusters that lie in subspaces of feature space. The shell clustering approach provides a powerful means to solve the hitherto unsolved problem of simultaneously fitting multiple curves/surfaces to unsegmented, scattered and sparse data. In this paper, we present several fuzzy and possibilistic algorithms to detect linear and quadric shell clusters. We also introduce generalizations of these algorithms in which the prototypes represent sets of higher-order polynomial functions. The suggested algorithms provide a good trade-off between computational complexity and performance, since the objective function used in these algorithms is the sum of squared distances, and the clustering is sensitive to noise and outliers. We show that by using a possibilistic approach to clustering, one can make the proposed algorithms robust

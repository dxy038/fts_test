Fault tolerance is an important requirement for long-running parallel programs. This paper presents a different approach to fault-tolerance support in message-passing parallel programs based on their structural and behavioral characteristics, commonly known as patterns. A classification of these patterns and their applicable fault-tolerance strategies is aimed to facilitate an application developer to incorporate appropriate fault-tolerance strategies to an application. Fault-tolerance strategies for two of the patterns are discussed, and one specific strategy is elaborated and analyzed. The presented strategies have been incorporated into a fault-tolerance support framework called FT-PAS. One objective of the framework is to separate the fault tolerance related details from an application developerÂ´s main objectives (separation-of-concerns). The paper presents the additional key features of the framework, and concludes with a discussion on current and future research directions.

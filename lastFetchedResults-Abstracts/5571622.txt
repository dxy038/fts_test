In this work we propose a joint two-side masking procedure for automatic analysis of mammographic images. The primary objective is the improvement of computerized systems capability in revealing additional findings, as the asymmetrical changes of the breast parenchyma. The method allows the proper comparison of the left and right breast by progressive selection of paired small areas on the mammogram, primarily the so-called \´\´forbidden areas", zones that need special attention in mammographic interpretation. The masking of specific areas of the mammogram requires the identification of two anatomical structures of the breast: the pectoral muscle and the nipple used, together with the breast skin line, to find paired matching points on the images for comparison. With this purpose, specific algorithms have been developed. In particular, a new method for nipple extraction will be presented and validated by expert radiologists, by the use of a proprietary program developed by the authors. Finally, an application example of the automatic Tabar masking procedure will be shown, in order to point out the potential of this method in detection of suspicious areas in mammograms.

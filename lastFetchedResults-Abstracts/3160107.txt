It presents a cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter employing bidirectional switches to design an effective circuit to increase the number of output voltage levels. In the proposed circuit configuration, each inverter produces five output voltage levels. Because the output terminals of both inverters are connected in series, the final output voltage becomes nine levels including a zero. Different switching patterns are given and analyzed with their operational principles. To verify the performance of the proposed multilevel inverter, we implemented computer-aided simulation and experiments using a prototype.

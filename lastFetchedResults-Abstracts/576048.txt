Introduction & Objective: Ischemic injury of endothelium is associated with prostaglandin synthesis and platelet adhesion and aggregation, which may be associated with the release of aldehydes such as malondialdehyde (MDA). C-reactive protein and cardiac troponin I have been proposed as diagnostic markers of acute coronary syndromes. In this study, we compared the usefulness of plasma MDA as a marker of acute coronary syndromes with that of C-reactive protein and troponin I.
Material & Methods:  The study population contained 50 patients with unstable angina and 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to the hearth department of the Ekbatan Hospital of Hamadan. The subjects were matched according to age and sex. Total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, plasma MDA, troponin I and C-reactive protein levels were determined in all patients. 
Results: Results showed that the plasma MDA levels were significantly higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction than in individuals with unstable angina (P < 0.001) and were associated with increased levels of troponin I and C-reactive protein (P < 0.001).
Conclusion:  The combination of the plasma MDA levels, which reflect endothelial injury, and troponin I and C-reactive protein levels may allow better discrimination in acute coronary syndromes patients

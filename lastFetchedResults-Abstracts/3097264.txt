The plug-and-play functionality of a typical microgrid should enable the connection of any microsource at any point without changing the system significantly. To achieve this feature, this paper presents a ´standard´ microsource interface concept with embedded with storage in the form of ultracapacitors. The photovoltaic panel, which is the microsource, is connected to the MicroGrid through an inverter and the storage is connected to the dc-link via a bidirectional converter. Simulation results of the complete interface are presented.

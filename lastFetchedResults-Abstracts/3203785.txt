This paper studies a leader-following rendezvous problem with connectivity preservation for a double integrator multi-agent system subject to a class of external disturbances. Motivated by some techniques in output regulation theory, we propose a dynamic distributed state feedback control protocol that is able to maintain the connectivity of an initially connected communication network, and, at the same time, achieve the objective of the asymptotic tracking of all followers to the leader regardless of external disturbances.

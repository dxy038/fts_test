Cellular neural network is very suitable to solve communication problems because of its local connection. This paper summarizes a new approach for CNN´s template design based on energy function, which is valid to such problems as equalizer and multi-user detector. This approach can combine the objective function of communication problems with CNN´s energy function, and then obtain reasonable CNN´s template. We also discuss the learning algorithm and hardware annealing joined with the approach. Simulation results prove that this method is valid to a class of communication problems

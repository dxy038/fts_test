An emerging infection is defined as an
infection that has newly appeared in a population while
a re-emerging infection would be one that has existed
in the past but its incidence has increased in recent
times. The reasons for the emergence or reemergence
of an infection are not completely understood but
they are multifactorial and complex in the nature of
their interactions. These factors may be related to the
etiological organism, the host or the environment.
Human activity appears to be a major driver. Malaysia
had to deal with outbreaks of several emerging infections
over the last two decades. They include Nipah virus
infection, SARS and avian influenza. Infections like
dengue, tuberculosis and leptospirosis are re-emerging
in Malaysia. Both human activity and climatic changes
appear to be key factors in the emergence and reemergence
of infections in Malaysia. Our country
needs to put in place a comprehensive plan to meet
the challenge of emerging diseases. A multidisciplinary
approach is required and the strategies involved should
not merely confined to medical and health strategies.

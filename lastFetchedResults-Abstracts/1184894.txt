An algorithm is developed for optimizing laminated plate stacking sequences and determining thicknesses, which incorporates discrete ply angles and considers the uncertainties of material properties in a two-step optimization process. The branch and bound method was modified to handle discrete variables; and convex modeling was used to allow the consideration of variable material properties. The numerical results obtained show that the optimal stacking sequences are determined with fewer evaluations of the objective function than might be expected from considerations of the size of the design space. Our results also show that the optimal thickness increases when elastic moduli uncertainties are considered, which indicates that such uncertainties should not be ignored at the design stage.

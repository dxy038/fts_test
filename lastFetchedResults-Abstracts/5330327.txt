The main objective is to develop a new Web-enabled simulation framework: to study and evaluate the performance of various uniprocessor real-time scheduling algorithms for real-time scheduling. Task ED, deadline, priority, period, computation time, and phase are the input task attributes to the scheduler simulator and chronograph imitating the realtime execution of the input task set and computational statistics of the schedule are the output. The proposed framework for the scheduler simulator is mainly developed to be used as a teaching tool. Evaluation of the performance of real-time schedulers can be done as well. Evaluation criteria are based on the mean response time, number of deadline misses, processor utilization, number of preemptions and context switches. The Web-based deployment of the simulator enables the user a platform-, machine- and software-independent utilization of the technical resource.

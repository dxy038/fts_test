Summary form only given. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy has been used to investigate the free layer reversal process in four different top spin-valve structures. These crossed anisotropy spin-valves were of the form seed/FL/Cu/CoFe/PtMn/cap and seed/FL/Cu/CoFe/Ru/CoFe/PtMn/cap, where pinning was by conventional AFM and synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) respectively. FL denotes free layer which in one case was CoFe and in the other a NiFe/CoFe bilayer. We refer to the stacks as NiFe/CoFe AFM, NiFe/CoFe SAF, CoFe AFM and CoFe SAF; the offset fields H/sub 1/ and magnetostriction coefficients were (14Oe, 0.4/spl times/10/sup -6/), (2.2Oe, -2.3/spl times/10/sup -6/), (10.4Oe, 6.6/spl times/10/sup -6/) and (10.8Oe, 7.6/spl times/10/sup -6/) respectively. Magnetic imaging by TEM was carried out in a controlled field environment using a combination of Lorentz lenses and the standard objective lens.

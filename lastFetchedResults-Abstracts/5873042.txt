A new approach based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is proposed for solving the optimal secondary voltage preventive control problem. The objective is to reschedule the generator power output and terminal voltages as well as the tap setting of the OLTC so as to keep the voltage secure along the trajectory of a quasi-steady-state time domain simulation with respect to a credible risky contingency which could be tripping of generation facility or transmission line. The proposed PSO-based approach is demonstrated on the Nordic 32 test system. Test results show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective in the preventive control problem of dynamic voltage security.

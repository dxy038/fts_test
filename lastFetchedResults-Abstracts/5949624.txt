The objective of this paper is to estimate instantaneous short wave solar radiation distribution over semi arid region in Dundgovi province of Mongolia. The instantaneous short wave solar radiation from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of Terra will be produced at 500m resolution. In our studies, the surface downward short wave radiation fluxes calculated by Nimela&#776;Â´s parameterization scheme. The comparison is carried out to test the estimated values of downward shortwave solar radiation and experimental station data in Dundgovi province of Mongolia.

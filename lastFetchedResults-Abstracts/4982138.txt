Henry Cogswell College (USA) has developed a set of competency-based engineering design curricula for technical (engineering, engineering technology and computer science) degree programs. These courses add more value to the graduatesÂ´ educational experience and at the same time satisfy program and institutional accreditation requirements. At the core of these curricula is a common sophomore-level introduction to engineering design course and a capstone sequence of senior design projects. The objective of these courses is to teach students the engineering design process as well as the skills and competencies based on industry-identified skill standards. An extensive educational outcomes assessment plan is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the design curricula against their specified goals

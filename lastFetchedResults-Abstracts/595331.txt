Objective: To identify the reasons due to which women resort to illegally induced abortions. Material and Methods: This Descriptive study was carried out in Department of Gynaencology and Obstetrics, Hayatabad Medical Complex Peshawar from May 2000 to April 2001. This study included 50 married women in reproductive age group, who had undergone illegal induced abortion, either visiting the hospital OPD or admitted in the gynae ward. Relevant information was recorded on a predesigned questionnaire prepared in accordance to the objectives of the study. An attempt was made to find out the reasons due to which women resorted to illegally abortion and to asses their attitudes towards contraception. Results: Forty Six (92%) terminations were carried out in the first trimester. In 17 (34%) cases there was a history of previous induced abortions. The most commonly used method was dilatation and currettage (76%). A variety of complications were encountered e.g. vaginal bleeding (28%), incomplete abortion (18%), sepsis (20%), and visceral injuries (6%). Most of the women were aware of the family planning methods. Contraception prevalence was higher among the better educated women. Non users were afraid of side effects. Predominant reasons for abortion were financial constraints (64%), child spacing (20%), contraceptive failure (12%) and extra marital affairs (4%). Conclusion: Socioeconomic, cultural and psychological pressure constituted the background as to why women felt forced to terminate their pregnancy. Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given the highest priority and attempts should be made to eliminate the need for abortion.

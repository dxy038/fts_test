Objective
Microarray technology was used to comprehensively analyze gene expression during human labor in the myometrium.
Study design
cDNA micro-array was used to compare the transcriptomes of myometrium obtained from patients in spontaneous labor and those not in labor. Expression of four labor-specific genes was confirmed in the myometrium obtained from patients in spontaneous labor using RT-PCR, Northern blot analysis, and in-situ hybridization.
Results
Of the >6000 cDNAs evaluated, 56 were found to be differentially expressed during labor. The labor-specific expression of 4 genes was confirmed using RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. The relative increased expression of thrombospondin-1 in myometrium obtained from patients in spontaneous labor was also confirmed using in-situ hybridization.
Conclusion
cDNA microarray was used to identify 56 differentially expressed genes in myometrium obtained from patients in spontaneous labor. The up-regulation of four genes was confirmed by multiple methods. Elucidation of the role(s) of the genes identified by microarray should improve our understanding of normal labor physiology and may ultimately lead to more effective treatments for abnormal labor.

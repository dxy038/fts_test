The main objective of study is to control the emission from diesel engine and improve the performance by using the emulsified fuel. A single cylinder, water cooled, four stroke diesel engine was used for this study. Experiments were conducted in the first phase at different ratios of emulsions via (50%diesel + 50 ethanol), (60% diesel + 40% ethanol), (70% diesel + 30 % ethanol) as fuel. From the investigation it was observed that (50%diesel + 50 % ethanol) proportion of emulsified fuel shows better result when compared to the sole fuel and other proportion of emulsified fuel. The second phase of the experimental was conducted with different injection angles (18&#176;, 20&#176;, 23&#176;, 24&#176;) for the optimum value of (50%diesel + 50 % ethanol) proportion of emulsified fuel. To study the combustion characteristic using AVL combustion analyzer. The result shows marginally reduction of emission such as smoke density, particulate matter and slightly increases the cylinder pressure for injection angle at 24&#176;.

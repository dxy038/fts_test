Tacit knowledge exists in knowledge workers in enterprises. To enable full sharing and improve core competitiveness, incentive mechanism models of knowledge sharing should be established for knowledge workers; According to principal- agency theory, and taking into account incomplete information of knowledge sharing, multi-stages incentive model of knowledge sharing for knowledge worker, incentive model of knowledge sharing for knowledge team based on team profits-sharing, and incentive model of knowledge sharing for the supplier, are proposed. The results indicate that, in order to acquire maximum rewards in enterprise, special incentive contracts are to be made for different knowledge main-bodies, optimal incentive decisions to meet enterprise own objective are to be made, and knowledge main-bodyÂ´s knowledge sharing efforts are to be improved.

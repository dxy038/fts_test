Objective: To study the results of surgical treatment and sequelae in nasal septum injuries in children. Methods: Between January 1990 and December 1997, 16 pediatric patients with septal haematoma and/or abscess were treated. Mean age was 5 years (range: 2â€“14 years). Thirteen were male (81.2%), and three were female (18.8%). In nine cases (56.2%) the disease was a consequence of a minor trauma. Only two children had nasal fracture associated (12.5%). Minimum follow-up after the first visit was 10 months (mean, 3 years). Results: All cases were surgically treated. Minor sequelae were observed in six cases (37.5%), and major ones in ten patients (62.5%). In this latter group, multiple reconstructive procedures were needed. Conclusions: It is necessary to be aware of the possibility of haematoma and abscess of the nasal septum. Major sequelae can be also expected after cases following minor traumas.

Crystal violet dye doped potassium dihydrogen phosphate single crystals were grown by Sankaranarayanan–Ramasamy method and slow cooling method with the vision to improve the properties of the crystal. The objective of this study is to show how organic dyes influence the growth, morphology of potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystal. The grown crystals were of size up to 130 mm in length and 10 mm in diameter. The incorporation of dye is more in the crystal grown by slow evaporation method compared to the crystal grown by Sankaranarayanan–Ramasamy method. The addition of dye improves the quality and yields more than 90% transparent crystals and growth rate is also very high. Thermal stability of the doped crystal is high compared to pure crystal. Low dielectric loss shows that the grown crystal contains minimum defects. The optical transmission, thermal and mechanical stability show the suitability of the ingot for optical applications.

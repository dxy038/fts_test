We are investigating utilizing ARFI imaging to guide prostate needle biopsy. Our previous ex vivo study demonstrated that ARFI imaging using a VF10-5 linear array was able to visualize the internal anatomy and suspicious lesions in the prostate, which may help improve the diagnostic accuracy of prostate needle biopsy. The objective of this study is to implement ARFI techniques on a 3D wobbler rectal probe and image human prostates <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i>. Three patients were imaged. The initial in vivo results are reported.

Castrated and entire Boer bucks (no. = 60) in groups of between three and five animals were slaughtered at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 kg live weight (5- and 15-kg animals were not castrated). Ultimate pH, muscle colour (subjective and objective measurement), subcutaneous fat colour, total pigment concentration, shear force values and eating quality were investigated. The ultimate pH of longissimus muscle increased from 5.7 to 6.2 (P < 0.05) as animals were slaughtered at heavier weights. Slaughter weight had an influence on chromameter muscle colour (L*, a*, b* values) and subjective muscle colour scores recorded using a nine-point colour scale (P < 0.05) for both entire and castrated bucks. Muscle redness (a* values) and subjective muscle colour scores increased gradually in older animals while muscle lightness and yellowness (L* and b* values) decreased. Subcutaneous fat colour became more yellow at heavier slaughter weights (P < 0.05). Shear force values were affected (P < 0.05) by slaughter weight but not by castration of bucks. All eating quality scores were influenced by slaughter weight but not by castration, and flavour, as predicted by eating quality scores, was the most important attribute that contributed to overall acceptability of the goat meat.

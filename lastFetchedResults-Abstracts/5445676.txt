Ontologies mentioned in this paper appear in the part of serving the objects identification of object oriented software engineering in initial phase. More ontologies are becoming available on the web, and are increasing in number and demand. Semantic and ontologies search engines have also started to appear, to assist search and recovery of online ontologies which it is the first start to find the ontologies for particular domain of interest. Considering object oriented software engineering, the difficulty of searching the appropriate objects for the system is the one major problem. The main objective of this research is to integrate the different eXtensible Markup Language based (XML-based) formats offered online by using produced Java-based application program to merge and modify ontologies into complete object model. The program will allow the developer to choose objects (extracted from ontologies classes) and their components which are attributes, operations, and relationships. The final result of the program will be used as the sketch object diagrams of the system. in this paper we represent travel domain of interest as the example for the approach.

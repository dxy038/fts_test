Our last paper covered the background, current spiral developments, roll out, and sustainment of the US Army\´s newest At-Platform Automatic Test Systems (APATS) equipment for TWVs (Tactical Wheeled Vehicles). The equipment, called the SWICE (Smart Wireless Internal Combustion Engine) system, was developed for vehicle diagnostics systems in at-platform and embedded applications, including prognostics. An overview of the SWICE system operation was described, including the Smart Wireless Diagnostic Sensor (SWDS) device, features of the Vehicle Integrated Diagnostics Software-Field (VIDS-F) implementation, and the vehicle Diagnostics Software (DS) application. We also covered the functions of the Prognostics Client "plug-in" module and integrated support for the Common Logistic Operating Environment (CLOE) implementation, along with the concept of leveraging the SWICE/SWDS as a &#8220;Mini-Vehicle Control System (VCS)&#8221;. Having built and delivered much of the SWICE system, we have found several practical considerations as we moved from design to true implementation. Beginning with an overview of the SWICE system, the primary focus of this paper summarizes two examples of bridging the gap between design and implementation, namely, wireless security and data logging. While the former required the SWICE\´s wireless networking to be secured with Federal Information Processing Standards, the latter provided for a new application for leveraged use of the SWICE/SWDS as a Mini-VCS. The objective is to further enhance Conditioned Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) secure diagnostics, data logging, prognostics and sensor integration to support improvement of the US military ground vehicle fleet\´s uptime to enhance operational readiness. Benefits include TWVs increased readiness and operational availability, reduced maintenance costs, lower repair part inventory levels, reduced cost of consumables, and an overall reduction in maintenance process errors.

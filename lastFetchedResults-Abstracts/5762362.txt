This paper presents a multi-objective approach bared on evolutionary programming (EP) to solve the economical operation of cogeneration system under emission constraints. A multi-objective function including the minimization of cost and emissions is formulated in this paper. The cost model includes fuels cost and tie-line energy. The emissions with CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>x</sub>, and NO<sub>x</sub> were derived as a function of fuel enthalpy. All constraints including fuel mix, operational constraints, and emission constraints must be met in the optimization process. The steam output, fuel mix, and power generations will be found by considering the time-of-use (TOU) dispatch between cogeneration systems and utility companies. Data of an industrial cogeneration system was used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

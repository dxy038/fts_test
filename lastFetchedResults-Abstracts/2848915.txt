Now most of the fatigue objective evaluation methods require a head-mounted eye tracker, electrical testing equipment, etc., and these devices are difficult to use in aircraft cockpit. Thus, a simple and practical method of detecting pilots fatigue is brought forward in this paper. This method firstly judges the open or close state of eyes by accurately finding out the frame of eyelid, and applies it to the PERCLOS detection. Secondly, the essay will explain the calculation of the spatial location of three key points. Thirdly, the essay will describe the face angle, which between the plane of these three points with the plane of human body. Finally, according to the PERCLOS parameters and the angle of human face, it is easier to determine the fatigue state. The research result in this paper is significance for the field of fatigue monitoring and eye gaze tracking.

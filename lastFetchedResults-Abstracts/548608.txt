Khaghani is a poet, who was not committed to a certain framework in his imaging styles. Thus, imaging materials are not specific phenomena in his similes. From the greatest creation affairs through the tiniest particles and seemly insignificant phenomena might be observed in his similes since his objective is to create beauty and embossment of those affairs, which exist objectively and subjectively in world of materials and to some extent in spiritual world as well. In this course, he has release himself from any kind of framework and or abidance, which the poets had made ones and others committed to them for imaging and aesthetic expression during past times. At any case, Khaghani has not sought for a pretext to flaunt oneself ostentatiously. In this paper, it has been tried to deal with one of simile topics that is imaging materials in similes, which reflects type of Khaghani’s insight and idea toward natural and metaphysical affairs and this may serve special position as one of stylistic characteristics in Khaghani’s odes.

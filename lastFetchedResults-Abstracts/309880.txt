Objective:
To develop a reliable method for the determination of tetrahydrobiopterin and total biopterin in plasma.
Methods:
Modifications include blood collection and handling procedures.
Results:
Collection of blood in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) dithiothreitol and waiting for 2â€“3 h before centrifugation are optimal for adequate quantitation of both pterins.
Conclusions:
For a reliable determination of tetrahydrobiopterin and total biopterin in plasma, blood tubes must contain a dimercapto-antioxidant and time between blood collection and centrifugation is critical.

Energy security, economic growth and environmental protection are the national energy policy drivers of any country of the world. Scientists, governments, and industries are witnessing the long-term consequences of energy consumption and foresee catastrophic outcomes if alternative methods of energy production are not developed and utilised to meet the needs of our global economy. In recent years, PV is proposed as a competitive energy policy and a step forward to the target of sustainable development and environmental friendly energy source. In this contribution a particular attention is being given to the joint event that bring together the relevant parties, the University of Sciences and Technology of Oran (USTO), Japan International Corporation and Japan Science and Technology Agencies (JICA, JST) to develop a long-term vision and strategy to boost the ideas for the realization and the development of the Sahara Solar Breeder (SSB) project. SSB advocates the view of undertaking collaborative basic, applied and development research, as well as industrial production and technical, commercial and financial support services to implement photovoltaic solar energy systems. The strategic objective is the establishment of a Global Clean Energy Superhighway as the solution to global energy challenges, water shortages, levelling of electric power supply in the world, climate change and other environmental problems arising from the current fossil-fuel heavy global energy paradigm [1]. This project will tackle the key challenges and issues related to the field of PV putting forward the USTO perspective and promoting its R/D activities by a collaborative research plan between Japan and Algeria. This event also seeks to identify the most important challenges facing both the research and economic sectors and put forward new strategies that will identify the required skills to transform the research prospects of USTO based on the analysis and prospect of elementary processes and system design.

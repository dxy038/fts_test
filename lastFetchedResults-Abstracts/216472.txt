Objective
The primary problem in children with cerebral palsy (CP), frequently referred
for occupational therapy, is gross motor dysfunction. The current study was
designed to investigate the effects of sensory integration therapy (SID on gross
motor skills in CP patients.
Materials & Methods
Twenty-four children with diplegic spastic CP were randomly divided into two
groups: First group (n=14,6 girls, 8 boys), age range 2 to 6 years, mean age 3.9
vears, the second or control group (n=IO, 5 girls, 5 boys), age range 2 to 6
years, mean age 3.4 years. SIT training was given to the first group and only the
home program was given for the second group. All children were evaluated
with gross motor function measurement (GMFM 88) for rolling, sitting, crawling,
standing and walking position before and after intervention. Treatment duration
for both groups was 1 hour,5 days per week for a period of 12 weeks.
Results
Gross motor function in children of the case group improved significantly better
that in the control group, after intervention in sitting (P=O.02), crawling (P=O.OOI)
and standing (P=O.03) positions; however no significant difference was seen in
rolling (P=O.65) and walking (P=O.69) ability assessment.
Conclusion
This study showed the beneficial effects of the SIT training program for children
with CP; the SIT intervention had a significantly positive effect on gross motor
function in the children with diplegic spastic CP. Moreover the results of the
present study showed that sensory integration and vestibular stimulation were
effective in children with cerebral palsy.

The AMRFS Program consists of two equal but distinct parts. This program description has provided details of design for equipment that would provide a &#8220;proof-of-concept&#8221; demonstration to be carried out by building an experimental test-bed and showing in real-time that the integration of RF functions, such as radar, electronic warfare, and communications, into a single system is technically feasible. This part of the Program deals with all the issues of establishing requirements, designing, building, testing, and demonstrating an integrated RF system. One purpose of this part of the Program is to provide risk reduction within a science and technology program. This is deemed important because of the large risk involved in building a first-of-a-kind multifunctional integrated RF system. The other part of the Program is concerned with advanced new components and subsystems technologies that would enable a more practical, cost effective, tactical system to be developed and deployed by the USA Navy. The ultimate objective of both parts of the Program is the transition of the integrated RF system technology to operational platforms within the Navy. An attempt was and is being made to provide acquisition program managers with risk reduced new technology and combat capabilities, in a timely manner, to allow insertion decisions at the earliest possible date

This paper deals with a new digital audio watermarking scheme based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technique. In digital communication, CDMA allows several users transmissions without interference from each other by sharing the same communication channel. The present work proposes to forward multiple watermarks in the same channel that is the audio signal. Our main objective is to increase the capacity of watermark information (the amount of information that can be hidden) in audio watermarking scheme. The new proposed watermarking system ensures the inaudibly constraint while inserting the maximum of watermarks with low Binary Error Rate (BER).

Iron (Fe) availability is low in calcareous soils of Iran due to high pH levels and presence of excessive amounts of CaC03. Overfertilization by phosphorus (P) fertilizers may also decrease Fe availability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of P, Fe and their interactions on the growth and chemical composition of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] under greenhouse conditions. Treatments consisted of a factorial arrangement of P rates (0,40, 80,120 and 160 mg kg'1 as KH2P04) and Fe rates (0,2.5, 5 and 10 mg kg"1 as FeEDDHA) in a completely randomized design with four replications. Plants were grown for 8 weeks in a loamy soil, classified as Chitgar series (fine-loamy, carbonatic, thermic, Typic Calcixerepts).
Results showed that P application up to 80 and Fe at 2.5 mg kg"1 increased shoot dry matter. Phosphorus concentration, total uptake and P.Fe ratio in soybean increased by P application but decreased by Fe application. Application of Fe up to 2.5 mg kg"1 increased dry matter but decreased it at higher rates. Concentration and total uptake of Fe increased by Fe application but decreased by P application. Interaction of P and Fe had no effect on shoot dry matter. Zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) concentrations decreased significantly when P was added and manganese (Mn) concentration increased up to 40 mg P kg"1 but decreased at higher rates. Iron application had no effect on soybean Zn and Cu concentrations but decreased Mn concentration at all rates. Prior to any fertilizer recommendations, it is necessary to study the effects of P, Fe and their interactions on soybean under field conditions.

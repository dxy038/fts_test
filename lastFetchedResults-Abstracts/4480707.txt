Reversible computing appears to be promising due its applications in emerging technologies. To compute any reversible function it is necessary to build the system with reversible gates. Simplified version of transformation technique [3,5] to synthesize new reversible gates with Fredkin and Toffoli gates network is presented in this paper. Basic and bidirectional transformation algorithms with an example are illustrated, which uncovers every step of the algorithm. The same example is used for both the algorithms to give clarity on the difference in the efficiency of the algorithms. Simple pseudo code is also presented to illustrate the steps of the algorithm. The best quantum cost obtained is listed in this paper.

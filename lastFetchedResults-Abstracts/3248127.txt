This paper is concerned with the bifurcation problem of bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with two delays. Two delays play different roles in dynamical behaviors of BAM neural networks. The characteristic equation associated with delayed BAM neural networks is analyzed, which gives the distribution of the eigenvalues. Then some important dynamic properties of the trivial steady state, such as the local stability and the existence of Hopf bifurcation, are obtained. The theoretical results are further validated by numerical simulations.

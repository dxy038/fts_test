Objective
The study aimed to evaluate the erosive effects of acids flowing with different velocities and duration on dentin previously pre-treated with distilled water or human saliva.
Methods

Bovine dentin surfaces were submitted to a 10 min demineralisation with hydrochloric or citric acid (pH 2.3, 37 °C) in an artificial mouth at flow rates of 3, 2.25, 1.5, 0.75 or 0.15 ml/min or in 30 ml of the respective acid without movement (each subgroup n = 16 specimens). Prior to the demineralisation, half of the specimens of each group were either pre-treated with distilled water or human saliva for 120 min. After 2, 5 and 10 min demineralisation, profilometric traces of dentin loss were performed perpendicular to the direction of acid flow at three sites (A–C) with intervals of 500 μm. The first profile (A) was taken in a distance of 1.5 mm from the acid starting to flow over the sample. Thus, median dentin loss at each site was calculated and statistically analysed by five-way ANOVA.
Results

Dentin loss increased with increasing acid flow rate and demineralisation time and was higher for demineralisation with citric acid compared to hydrochloric acid. For given flow rates of 0.15 to 3 ml/min, measurement of dentin loss yielded highest values for site A and decreasing values for sites B and C. For all groups, no significant differences of dentin loss were observed between specimens pre-treated with distilled water or human saliva.
Conclusion

Under the conditions of this study, both duration of demineralisation and acid flow rate but not pre-treatment with distilled water or saliva influence the extent of dentin erosion.

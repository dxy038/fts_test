Reliable communication in underground mines and tunnels has always been an issue. The leaky feeder (LF) is the most widely used medium for radio wave transmission in the underground environment. The LF has carefully designed radiating slots along its length that act as bidirectional antennas. Since there will be a finite phase shift between the RF signals radiated from the slots, that depends on the radio frequency and slot separation, modeling the LF as a single radiating element is not accurate. In this paper, the LF is modeled as a multi antenna array supporting a multi-input-single-output (MISO) system. The received signal of this MISO system is estimated under various conditions assuming a Binary Phase Shift Keying signal (BPSK) modulation.

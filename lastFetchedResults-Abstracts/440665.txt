Background. In patients with a univentricular arteriovenous connection, transection of the main pulmonary artery may be performed as part of a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt or Fontan procedure. The proximal stump of the pulmonary artery may remain in the systemic circulation. In cases with a discordant ventriculoarterial connection, subsequent restriction of the bulboventricular foramen may lead to subaortic stenosis. The subaortic stenosis can be corrected in some patients by directing the systemic flow through a combined nonobstructed aortopulmonary outlet, as in the Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection. Previous closure of the pulmonary artery has been considered by some investigators to be a relative contraindication to the Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure, unless an allograft root can be added to the circuit after excision of the closed pulmonary stump.
Methods. Three patients with previously transected pulmonary arteries underwent a modified Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection using the native pulmonary valve and the proximal pulmonary artery stump.
Results. The native pulmonary valves have functioned well despite thrombus formation in the proximal stump in 2 patients before Damus conversion. All 3 patients are alive and well after 108, 19, and 3 months, with competent nonobstructed ventriculoarterial connections.
Conclusions. If transection and closure of the pulmonary artery as part of a previous palliation has spared the pulmonary valve, then the native pulmonary outlet might be used for a safe Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection.

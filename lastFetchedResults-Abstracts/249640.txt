A multilevel genetic algorithm (MLGA) is proposed in this paper for solving the kind of optimization
problems which are multilevel structures in nature and have features of mixed-discrete design variables,
multi-modal and non-continuous objective functions, etc. Firstly, the formulation of the mixed-discrete
multilevel optimization problems is presented. Secondly, the architecture and implementation of MLGA
are described. Thirdly, the algorithm is applied to two multilevel optimization problems. The  rst one is
a three-level optimization problem in which the optimization of the number of actuators, the positions
of actuators and the control parameters are considered in di erent levels. An actively controlled tall
building subjected to strong wind action is considered to investigate the e ectiveness of the proposed
algorithm. The second application considers a combinatorial optimization problem in which the number
and con guration of actuators are optimized simultaneously, an actively controlled building under
earthquake excitations is adopted for this case study. Finally, some results and discussions about the
application of the proposed algorithm are presented

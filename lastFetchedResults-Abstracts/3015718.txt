Two vibration control schemes, negative velocity feedback and modal control, are combined together to improve the stability of active vibration suppression. Spillover effects have been associated with implementing of the modal controller to lightly damped structures. The objective of this hybrid control scheme is to augment inheriting damping to the uncontrolled modes using negative velocity feedback and to suppress lower frequency vibration modes using the modal controller. Four configurations of the modal controller have been performed to examine the spillover effects. It is found that the stability of the modal controller with the feedback can be improved when used for suppressing structure vibrations.

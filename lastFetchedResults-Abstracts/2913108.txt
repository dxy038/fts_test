For the development of integrated broadband communication (IBC) services, the usability of the system is one of the main factors which contribute to the success of the system. The authors describe the preliminary results of a multi-author multi-media authoring pilot study which was carried out to verify the candidate evaluation tools to ensure that these tools can be used for evaluating the yet-to-be specified candidate usability principles for IBC services. Based on the assumed usability characteristics, evaluation tools (observation, questionnaires, interview, and objective data recording) were developed and tested. It is suggested that several evaluation tools should be used for complementing each other and accomplishing a more complete and accurate evaluation

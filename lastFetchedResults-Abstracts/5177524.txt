This paper presents a multi-agent based architecture of context-aware systems. Our objective is to make the architecture more extensible and can be easily applied to developing most context-aware applications. We also discussed how to add context-aware abilities to the existing applications. In our research, we divide the context-aware system into several parts, and we use multiple agents to process corresponding information respectively. Each agent is highly independent of the others, and we nearly donÂ´t need to make any changes to other agents when we want to modify one of them.

Objective: This study was undertaken to determine whether surgery for advanced pelvic organ prolapse corrects the voiding dysfunction commonly associated with this condition and if so to evaluate the ability of preoperative voiding studies to predict such correction. Study Design: We reviewed the records of all women who underwent surgery at our center between January 1996 and June 1999 for stage 3 or 4 pelvic organ prolapse. Patients were included in this review if they had a postvoid residual volume of >100 mL documented by catheterization on at least 2 occasions, had no normal postvoid residual volumes documented, and had undergone preoperative multichannel urodynamic testing that included an instrumented voiding study. Demographic and urodynamic data were analyzed for the ability to predict whether the elevated postvoid residual volume would be resolved after surgery. Results: Thirty-five patients satisfied the criteria for inclusion in the review. Twenty-six had stage 3 pelvic organ prolapse and 9 had stage 4 pelvic organ prolapse. The mean preoperative postvoid residual volume was 226 mL (range, 105-600 mL). Thirty-one patients (89%) had normal postvoid residual volumes after surgery. As a predictor of elevated postoperative postvoid residual volumes, the preoperative voiding study (performed with the prolapse reduced) had a sensitivity of 66%, a specificity of 46%, a positive predictive value of 12%, and a negative predictive value of 93%. Conclusion: In our center a preoperative voiding study performed with the pelvic organ prolapse reduced most accurately predicted postoperative voiding function when results of the voiding study were normal. Most patients with advanced pelvic organ prolapse and elevated postvoid residual volume had normalization of the postvoid residual volume after surgical correction of the pelvic organ prolapse.

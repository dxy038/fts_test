Interwavelength-band nonlinear interactions are investigated as possible causes of performance degradation in ultrawide band wavelength-division-multiplexed transmission. These interactions can severely limit the performance of transmission over dispersion-shifted fibers (DSFs) and nonzero DSFs. Bidirectional transmission is found to be effective in suppressing interwavelength-band nonlinear interactions.

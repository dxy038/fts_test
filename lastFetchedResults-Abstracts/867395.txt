This paper investigates a single-machine deteriorating job scheduling problem with job release times where its objective is to minimize the makespan. The problem is known to be NP-hard. Therefore, a branch-and-bound algorithm incorporating with several dominance properties and lower bounds is proposed to derive the optimal solution for the problem. In addition, easy-implemented heuristic algorithms are also provided to obtain the near-optimal solution. The computational experiments indicate that the branch-and-bound algorithm can solve most of the medium-job-sized problems within a reasonable time, and the heuristic is quite accurate with an average error percentage of less than 0.3%.

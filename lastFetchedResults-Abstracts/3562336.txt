Three Nb/sub 3/Sn cable-in-conduit prototype conductors have been manufactured in the framework of the European conductor development program for NET. They have been tested in the FENIX test facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, beyond their operating conditions, with current up to 40 kA, magnetic field up to 13.5 T, and supercritical helium up to 8 K. The testing procedure is described and the test results are discussed. The main objective of the test was the measurement of temperature margin under DC operation and the hydraulic pressure drop.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

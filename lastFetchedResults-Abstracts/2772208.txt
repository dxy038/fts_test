This paper proposes a new approach for corrective voltage control (CVC) of power systems in presence of uncertain wind power generation and demand values. The CVC framework deals with the condition that a power system encounters voltage instability as a result of severe contingencies. The uncertainty of wind power generation and demand values is handled using a scenario-based modeling approach. One of the features of the proposed methodology is to consider participation of demand-side resources as an effective control facility that reduces control costs. Active and reactive redispatch of generating units and involuntary load curtailment are employed along with the voluntary demand-side participation (demand response) as control facilities in the proposed CVC approach. The CVC is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The objectives are ensuring a desired loading margin while minimizing the corresponding control cost. This problem is solved using &#949;-constraint method, and fuzzy satisfying approach is employed to select the best solution from the Pareto optimal set. The proposed control framework is implemented on the IEEE 118-bus system to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness.

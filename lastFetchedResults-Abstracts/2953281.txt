The authors have already conducted an analysis of landslide areas with remote sensing data and thematic map data respectively. Estimation of landslide areas, however, has been considered very difficult because the principal factor of landslide complexly relates to some phenomena. The objective of this study is to find areas where landslides may occur in the near future by using satellite remote sensing data and thematic-map data related to landslide areas with GIS (geographic information system) techniques. The authorsÂ´ research focused on the actual vegetation in landslide areas. The relationship between vegetation and landslide areas were extracted with the thematic maps including an actual vegetation map

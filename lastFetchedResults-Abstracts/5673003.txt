The objective of this paper is to research to use a few MEMS (Micro Electron Mechanical System) temperature sensors for measurement and estimation of temperature distribution in the core and cavity of the mold during injection molding process. Decreasing the number of MEMS temperature sensors inside the core and cavity will reduce the cost for making product and still calibrate precisely. In this study, we describe the injection molding process equation with Hele-Shaw theory. And then we use simulation software to find the temperature values of the plastic flow in the mold wall. Using heat transfer and experimental error correction, we can deduce the actual temperature distribution inside core and cavity of the mold. Finally, account for comparing with deduction and experimental results from embedded micro temperature sensors, correct simulative data can verify our system as indicated above.

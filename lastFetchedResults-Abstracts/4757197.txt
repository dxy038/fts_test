Power allocation was a key technique that could significantly improve the performance of radio access networks. But in the centralized, collaborative, cloud-based and clean radio access network(C-RAN), there were few power allocation algorithms proposed in it. In this paper, we established an optimization model which took the system capacity as the objective function and solved the globally optimal solution of the model which was a group of transmitted power of users via the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm(AFSA). So we proposed a power allocation algorithm maximizing system capacity applied in the C-RANs. Numerical results showed that the power allocation algorithm proposed in the paper could enormously enhance the system capacity compared to the existing non-cooperative power control game and pricing(NPGP) algorithm.

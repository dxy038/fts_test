A comprehensive and objective post-evaluation of rural electric network reformation (RENR) will bring a scientific suggestion for decision-making with the financing is shortage. In this paper, on the base of analyzing methods used in post-evaluation before, a new model, which integrated with fuzzy theory, interval number and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), is proposed. Multi-factors and information of quantization and non-quantization are considered in this model. The human influence is reduced by making fuzzy evaluation weights through interval number and AHP, which is useful in practice. Finally, a demonstration of post-evaluation of RENR is given. The result shows that this model is feasible and more objective compared with others.

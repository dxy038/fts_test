To improve the torque characteristics of the liquid viscous coupling (LVC), a method which combined the Matlab with iSIGHT platform was presented. Slots and perforations in the plates have great influence on the torque characteristics of the LVC, so make the geometrical parameters of the slots and perforations as optimizing variables. Integrating iSIGHT with Matlab, the platform and simulation processes of multi-objective design optimization of the LVC were constructed. The result from the platform test demonstrated that LVC has a better performance of the torque output characteristics with optimization parameters, while the weight of the LVC was reduced.

Background and Objective: Available information suggests that pregnant women infected with Trichomonas vaginalis may be at increased risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight (LBW). This study evaluated the association between T. vaginalis infection and the risk of LBW.
Materials and Methods: In this cohort study, we evaluated 1000 pregnant women (gestational age ? 28 weeks) for trichomoniasis by using direct and culture methods at the time of delivery at two hospitals of Zanjan, Iran. All the infected women (33 cases) and non-infected women (107) who had been selected with purposive quota sampling were compared with each other. Questionnaires were used to collect demographic and obstetric parameters. Consequently, infants' weights were recorded using mothers’ files.
Results: The prevalence of T. vaginalis infection was 3.3% (33 cases). Mean gestational age of the infected women at the time of delivery was significantly less than the non-infected (36.5±4.5 weeks vs. 39±1.9 weeks; P= 0.009). Higher parity, and living in city were significantly associated with the increased risk of vaginal trichomoniasis (P <  0.05). No significant association was found between the T. vaginalis infection and degree of education, type of delivery, family income, and frequency of LBW.
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that, T. vaginalis infection may be associated with low gestational age and higher parity at the time of delivery. However, no significant association was found between the T. vaginalis infection and LBW in the third trimester of pregnancy.

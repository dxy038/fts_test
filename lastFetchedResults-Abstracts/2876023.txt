Optimal deployments of sensor nodes have importance in wireless sensor nodes and have strong influence on the performance of wireless sensor networks. This paper focuses on real time deployment of sensor nodes using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). it is important in battlefield surveillance, disaster monitoring, environmental and habitat monitoring etc. it plays a very important role in disasters affecting areas like flood affected or fire affected forests for sensing different conditions and physical data. The objective of this paper is to deploy sensor nodes only in terrain of interest not in fire or water so as to conserve nature and to reduce the loss of sensor nodes from being deploy in fire or water. Image segmentation of the images captured by camera on the board of UAV. This paper focuses on a vision system that considers the colour and the texture of the terrains in the image so as to provide more accurate deployment. Image segmentation is formulated as multidimensional optimization problems. To solve these problems it requires enormous effects so these optimization tools PSO [1] and GA are used to solve these problems. Comparison of these optimization tools PSO and GA are presented here for different pictures. Simulation results show that GA performs better than PSO when compared with no. of individuals and GA is faster than PSO as well.

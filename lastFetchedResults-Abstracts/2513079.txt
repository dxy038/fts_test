Objective: CRISPR/Cas9 technology provides a powerful tool for targeted modification of
genomes. In this system, a donor DNA harboring two flanking homology arms is mostly used
for targeted insertion of long exogenous DNA. Here, we introduced an alternative design for
the donor DNA by incorporation of a single short homology arm into a circular plasmid.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, single homology arm donor was applied
along with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) specific to the homology region, and either Cas9 or its
mutant nickase variant (Cas9n). Using Pdx1 gene as the target locus the functionality of this
system was evaluated in MIN6 cell line and murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
Results: Both wild type Cas9 and Cas9n could conduct the knock-in process with this system.
We successfully applied this strategy with Cas9n for generation of Pdx1GFP knock-in mouse
ESC lines. Altogether, our results demonstrated that a combination of a single homology arm
donor, a single guide RNA and Cas9n is capable of precisely incorporating DNA fragments of
multiple kilo base pairs into the targeted genomic locus.
Conclusion: While taking advantage of low off-target mutagenesis of the Cas9n, our new
design strategy may facilitate the targeting process. Consequently, this strategy can be applied
in knock-in or insertional inactivation studies.

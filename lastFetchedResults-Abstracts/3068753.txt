While solving a variety of problems of the geographic networks (GN) management by means of GIS there is an objective necessity of the representation of the extended information about the GN structure. For the purpose of effectively storing and operating such type of information, it is necessary that this ability should be put into the base of the GIS data model. This paper offers new approach to the creation of the integrated data model of the GIS for GN management that enables to describe the GN structure on the base of the extended set of binary relations between the networkÂ´s objects. The different aspects of the model applications in the development of industrial GIS for GN management are considered.

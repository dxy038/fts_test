In this paper, we deal with the real-time dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) problem using a nonlinear traffic flow model. A feedback control based on flatness technique is introduced. The control objective is to minimize the difference of the travel time on alternate routes in a road network which have the same origin and destination. Accordingly, congestion could be reduced or eliminated. Some numerical simulations are carrying out to demonstrate the relevance of introduced method in the case when the geometric condition of the alternate routes are the same as well as when some behaviour of the two alternate routes are different.

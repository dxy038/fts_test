The objective of this paper is to describe a sociotechnological approach to characterize technological and human resource in manufacturing systems. The proposed methodology takes into account the bounds of a purely technological approach of production systems, when we should study the integration on a large scale (shop, factory or factories net) of the various functions and different resources of these systems. The approach we suggest is based on an explanation of the aims, means, and relationships between these two ideas. Our model is divided into three sub models: objects and tasks, implemented resources and abilities, and a sub model of devolution and work integration. We applied the proposed framework and methodology to several manufacturing lines in the automotive industry.

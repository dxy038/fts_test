A modular architecture for power constrained embedded devices which leverages an agent based middleware in order to impose intelligence over critical infrastructures which require real time actions is always desirable in the case of Wireless Sensor Networks. The main objective of such architecture is the integration of a Wireless Sensor Network with the internet. This objective indicates the need of Ipv6 ready devices as well as the utilization of newly emerged standards such as the 6lowpan which forms an abstraction layer between the Medium Access control and the IP layers.

Institutions of learning are increasingly changing academic resources and material into electronic form for learnersÂ´ easy access. These electronic resources (e-resources) have enhanced information retrieval and improved accessibility of quality academic materials. As a result, academic institutions such as universities have invested vast amounts of money to make the best use of these e-resources. Notwithstanding these efforts, research shows that, students have made little effort to utilize these resources. The objective of this study therefore, was to identify factors that influence the use of e-resources in higher institutions of learning. Based on the literature, a conceptual framework was developed from the identified factors that were considered to be influencing the use of e-resources. Data was collected using a close-ended questionnaire from learners at different levels of study at Tshwane University of Technology, South Africa. The collected data was analyzed quantitatively and results indicated that; awareness, training programs, reliability of network connections and low bandwidth are critical to the use of e-resources. The developed framework is expected to be used by other researchers while extending research addressing technology usage. Further still, institutions of learning would consider the designed framework to readdress factors that are essential for the use of technology in their settings.

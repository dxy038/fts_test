One of the major and most visible activities in the evolution of our ATM systems is the modification or upgrade of the controller working position (CWP). The process of developing for the controller working environment and achieving controller acceptance has frequently proved to be one of the most problematic steps in putting new systems into operation. The objective of our current project, ´Core Requirements for ATM Working Positions´ (CoRe) is to improve the effectiveness of this development process and reduce uncertainty and risk for the various stakeholders involved. Our approach is based on trying to understand the nature of the process and the difficulties it can encounter and to suggest solutions that can mitigate these difficulties. The solutions can be based on organisational, human factors, software engineering or technical principles. In the present, paper we focus on the identification of the reasons why the development process has been relatively difficult in the ATM context. The paper describes the evolution of the analysis, and how it has been translated into objectives, strategy and requirements for a supportive framework, specifically tailored to improve the information transfer between the different actors and between successive projects

The algorithm for the association rules of data mining is updating and reforming, and more and more algorithms are present now. Most of the algorithm evaluations make advances only from some aspect, which makes the users select difficultly. In this study, we apply the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) to the comprehensive evaluation of algorithm, by which the subjective and objective evaluations could be combined to comprehensively evaluate the algorithm and help the users find out the most suitable algorithm.

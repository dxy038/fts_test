In order to evaluate the potentialities of the scatter link and to minimize the financial risk involved in its implementation, examination of many combinations of path, sites, and system configurations is desirable. To assist this process, and to minimize the financial risks involved in uncertainties, a formal analytical procedure for the study of these circuits is desirable. The essential structure for such a procedure is outlined. A step-by-step process is involved, commencing with determination of an objective weighting factor for site evaluation. Data are presented for resolution of further steps dealing with median path loss, design accuracy, traffic loading, instantaneous fading, SNR, error rates, bandwidth and power. A performance index for path evaluation is used so that an optimum path-site combination may be selected. An index for comparison of various paths carrying different traffic loads with different reliabilities is suggested. Equations for the use of this data in specific design situations are also given.

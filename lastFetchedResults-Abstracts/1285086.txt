Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) results from infection by the retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is the most significant risk factor for many opportunistic infections like tuberculosis, hepatitis, bacterial infections, etc. In this paper, we designed aminopyrimidinimino isatin lead compound as a novel non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic properties for the effective treatment of AIDS and AIDS-related opportunistic infections. Compound 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7[[N4-[3′-(4′-amino-5′-trimethoxybenzylpyrimidin-2′-yl)imino-1′-(5-fluoroisatinyl)]methyl]-N1-piperazinyl]-3-quinoline carboxylic acid (12) emerged as the most potent broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic agent active against HIV, HCV, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and various pathogenic bacteria.

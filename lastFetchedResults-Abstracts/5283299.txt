Communication lines in wire communication systems are usually used as power lines. The ac communication signal and dc supply power are separated at the input part in a powered terminal. Conventional well-known separators utilize the combined circuits of inductors and capacitors. When the frequency of the signal is at its lowest, the inductance increases, making it necessary to have a large inductor. A conventional electronic choke circuit using transistors has the disadvantage of high power dissipation. Furthermore, the direction of the dc current is limited to unidirectional. Our original communication system consists of powering terminals with low-power ac-dc converters and the terminals they power. The direction of the dc current in the powering terminals is opposite to that in the powered terminals. Therefore, it is preferable to have a bidirectional electronic choke. In this paper, a new low-loss electronic choke with small inductors and an amplifier is proposed and wide band technique is introduced.

A novel integrated approach to Cognitive Radio environment with Radar signals of type linear frequency modulation (LFM) as Primary User (PU) is suggested in this paper. The approach consists of spectrum sensing of Radar signals through Wigner-Hough transformation process integrated with the learning and adaptation using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) for dynamic spectrum allocation. The objective of minimizing the interference in the presence of radar signal and maximizing the spectral efficiency when radar signal is not detected are considered. In addition, the objective of minimizing the power consumption is also considered. The functionality of the process considers the operation of NI-USRP<sup>&#174;</sup> device as SU and radar as PU over ISM-UHF band of 902-928MHz for attaining the fitnessÂ´s of the SU parameters as desired. For validation, existing method for co-existence of SU with radar is compared for data-rate with the proposed method.

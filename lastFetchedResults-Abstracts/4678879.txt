In traditional study of distributed generation a complete solution for determining DGsÂ´ allocation and operation is lacking. For this reason, optimal placement and dispatching is investigated in this paper, which divides the problem into two major parts. An optimal placement model for determining the sizes and sites of DGs is developed, which takes the operation and risk fees as its objective function. Based on the different strategies, two optimal dispatching models are also developed which determine the 24 hours-operation of DGs and energy storage. An example illustrates that the models developed in this paper is effective.

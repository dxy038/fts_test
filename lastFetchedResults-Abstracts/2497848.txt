Different aspects and characteristics in the patients vary in different areas in the world. Our objective was to study clinical and demographic characteristics of bullous pemphigoid in Iranian patients. In a retrospective descriptive study, we reviewed 122 patients with bullous pemphigoid within 1987-2007. Demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatment, relapses and outcome were evaluated. The mean age of 122 patients was 65 Â± 18.11 years including 35.2% male and 64.8% female. The most common manifestations were cutaneous bullae (97.5%). 27% had oral lesions. 30.3% had eosinophillia. 90 patients(73.8%) received oral prednisolone, 29 patients (23.8%) topical steroid, 2 patients tetracycline and 1 patient dapsone. 89 patients were followed after admission. Out of them 44 patients experienced first relapse and 22 patients second relapse. 41 cases (46%) were completely controlled. 11 cases (12%) were not controlled.

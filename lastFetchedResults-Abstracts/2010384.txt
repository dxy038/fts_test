IUPAC has sponsored three international workshops on vaporâ€“liquid equilibria and related properties in binary and ternary mixtures of ethers, alkanes, and alkanols with the objective of developing a set of recommended values. Particular interest has focused on methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE, methyl 1,1-dimethylethyl ether), tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME, 1,1-dimethylpropyl methyl ether), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE, ethyl 1,1-dimethylethyl ether), dipropyl ether (DPE), diisopropyl ether (DIPE, bis(1-methylethyl) ether) and other selected ethers that are used or are being considered as gasoline additives to improve the octane rating and reduce exhaust pollution. From a detailed literature search and from contact with researchers currently working in the field, a comprehensive review of the mixtures and properties (both binary and ternary) that have been studied or are presently under study is presented here. This information will allow workers in the field to ascertain the mixture classes and types where sufficient data are now available and where further property measurements are required.

The high heterogeneity of grid resources, diversity of politics of access and publication of characteristics are examples on how it is difficult to primarily select grid resources based on requirements of an application. Another aspect that can illustrate the challenge is the flexibility to accept new resources that become dynamically available inside a configuration. On the other hand, some applications require multiple resources to attend its requisites. In this article, we present a prototype which was designed and implemented with the objective to reduce to the smallest as possible the magnitude of these problems. The prototype considers a resource selector module based on ontology paradigm which is also able to select multiple resources for an application. Case studies employing the proposed approach indicate that we reached the main objectives successfully.

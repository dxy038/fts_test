Background and Objective: In different studies, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome outbreak has been reported as high as 7-43% among the women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study was performed to determine the prevalence and predictors of the metabolic syndrome in PCOS women in Ahvaz.
Subjects and Methods: In an epidemiologic descriptive study, a total number of 53 women who attended the endocrinology clinic in Ahvaz from 2007 through 2008, and were diagnosed as PCOS, according to the Rotterdam criteria, were enrolled in the study. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was studied on the basis of the  criteria explained by American National Cholesterol Panel (ATP-III criteria)
Result: Fifty three women with the mean age of 24 Â± 6.8 years were studied in this research. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in  women of Ahvaz was estimated to be as 13.5%, and the prevalence for individual components comprising the metabolic syndrome were: fasting glucose blood concentrations greater than or equals to 110 mg/dl in 4 patient (7.7%), hypertension in 4 patients (7.7%), waist circumference greater than or equals to 88 cm in 14 patients (34.1%), HDL less than 40 mg/dl in 12 patients (24%), triglyceride greater than or equals to 150 mg/dl in 5 patients (9.4%), IFG in 17 patients (32.7%), diabetes in 3 patients (5.8%) and dislipidemia in 31 patients (60%).

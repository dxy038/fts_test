The main objective of this work was to investigate the effectiveness of long-term averages of the orthogonal linear prediction parameters in text-independent speaker recognition. To investigate the possibility of feature selection, a technique using dynamic programming (1) was used to select a subset of k best features among the entire set N. The results indicate that the parameters comprising the optimal set chosen are speaker-dependedt. Verification accuracies of 96.5% were obtained using the selected optimal 8- parameter (out of 12) feature set for each speaker in a verification scheme, in which the reference parameters were generated from 100 seconds of time-spaced voiced speech and the test parameters were generated from 5 seconds of voiced speech.

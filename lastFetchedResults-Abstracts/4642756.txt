A novel miniature coplanar waveguide (CPW) fed octagon shaped slot antenna used for wireless local area network is proposed. The antenna is designed on a RT/duriod 5880 substrate with a permittivity of 2.2 and size of 16.5mm &#215; 20 mm &#215; 1.6mm to generate single resonant mode with bandwidth of 0.94 GHz (5.095 GHz - 6.035 GHz) covering 5.2/5.8 GHz, antenna gain 3.55 dBi, VSWR 5.5 GHz -1.062 and return loss (S11) - 30.42 dB, respectively. The radiation patterns are broadside and bidirectional in the E - plane and almost omnidirectional in the H-plane. This antenna is suitable for wireless local area network applications. The fundamental parameters of the antenna such as return loss, VSWR, gain and polarization which meets the acceptable antenna standards are obtained. Simulation tool, based on the method of moments ZELAND IE3D version 12.0 has been used to analyze and optimize the antenna. These properties with compact and uniplanar structure make the antenna suitable in WLAN application.

Oxides resulting from discrete changes in composition within the quasi-ternary system La0.8Sr0.2CuO2.4 + δ–La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 − δ–La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 − δ were investigated under similar experimental conditions with the objective of obtaining an overview of the variation of the relevant properties for possible applications as cathode contact layer in SOFCs. Twenty-two oxide compositions within this system were systematically selected and synthesized under identical conditions by the Pechini method. The distribution of the different crystallographic phases at 1050 °C within this quasi-ternary phase diagram, the DC electrical conductivity at 800 °C and the thermal expansion coefficients are presented. Perovskites of different compositions issued from this ternary diagram were tested as cathode contact material between an La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 cathode and a Crofer22APU interconnect by resistance measurements at 800 °C. The application of a MnCo1.9Fe0.1O4 spinel protection reduced the interfacial reaction between the Crofer22APU and the cathode contact material. Electrical resistance measurements at 800 °C in air up to 1000 h and the analysis by scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of the sample cross-sections were carried out to verify the surface stability and the electrical performance.

he main objective of the advertising discourse is to encourage its viewer or reader to buy goods. This dialogue contains several inductive functions, including inductive functions of action and tension. The function of the induced action is an action-induced origin, whereas the function of the inductive tension is induced by the action originated. Thus, tension-induced functions can be claimed to be the extension of the induction interaction. On the other hand, the induced action and tension advertisings have similarities due to the intellectual history of their creators. Therefore, this paper is to compare various aspects of domestic and foreign advertisements, which are active or tensive, and to confide the relationship between these two functions. Accordingly, in the present study examples of such advertisements as billboards, magazines and media on internet will be studied based on inductive action and tension functions.

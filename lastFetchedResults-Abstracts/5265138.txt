The objective of the current study is to research, design, implement and test a tool that provides a repository of learning objects and records a profile of the learners, in order to deliver a customized version of the learning object to the learners taking into account their optimal learning profile and inclusive design in mind. The intention is to package and deliver content taking into account the diversity in learning subjects and materials encountered by teachers and learners. To this end, Intensional logic and programming is introduced to address learner diversity in a Web-based teaching and learning environment. Intensional programming is used to make adaptations on the server as it transforms Web pages &#194;&#191;on the fly&#194;&#191; without requiring Web content to be re-written for each specific user. This project has been supported with a grant from the Canadian Council on Learning and CanAssist at the University of Victoria.

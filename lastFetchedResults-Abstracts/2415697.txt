BACKGROUND: The main objective of this experiment was optimal use of none edible protein
source to increase nutritional value of production with high biological function, including
antioxidant activity.
METHODS: Sheep visceral (stomach and intestine) was used as substrate. Response surface
methodology (RSM) was used to optimize hydrolysis conditions for preparing protein
hydrolysate from the sheep visceral, using alcalase 2.4 l enzyme. The investigated factors were
temperature (43-52 °C), time (90-180 min), and enzyme/substrate ratio [60-90 Anson-unit
(AU)/kg protein] to achieve maximum antioxidant activity. Experiments were designed
according to the central composite design.
RESULTS: Each of the studied variables had a significant effect on responses (P  <  0.05). Optimal
conditions to achieve antioxidant activity were, temperature (48.27 °C), time (158.78), min and
enzyme/substrate ratio (83.35) Anson-unit/kg protein. Under these conditions, antioxidant
activity was 68.21%, R2 for model was 0.983. The values indicated the high accuracy of the
model to predict the reaction conditions considering different variables. The chemical analysis
of protein hydrolysate showed high protein content (83.78%) and low fat content (0.34%).
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that protein hydrolysate of sheep visceral, can be used as a
natural antioxidant with high nutritional value.

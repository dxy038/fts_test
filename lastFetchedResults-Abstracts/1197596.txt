This work investigates the heat transfer performance in an enclosure including nanofluids with a localized heat source. The velocity field is solved by multiple relaxation time lattice Boltzmann modeling (MRT) which has superior numerical advantages to single relaxation time lattice Boltzmann modeling (SRT); however, heat transfer is simulated separately using SRT-lattice Boltzmann modeling. The hydrodynamics and thermal fields are then coupled together using the Boussinesq approximation. The main objective of this study is to investigate the influence of several pertinent parameters such as Rayleigh number, solid particle volume fraction of nanoparticles, and the geometry as well as location of the localized heat source on the heat transfer performance of nanofluids. The results obtained from lattice Boltzmann modeling clearly indicate that heat transfer augmentation is possible using nano-fluids in comparison to conventional fluids, resulting in the compactness of many industrial devices.

Software systems are evolving continuously in order to fulfill the ever-changing business needs. This endless modification, however, decreases the internal quality of the system over time. This phenomena is called software erosion, which results in higher development, testing, and operational costs. The SourceAudit tool presented in this paper helps managing the technical risks of software deterioration by allowing imme-diate, automatic, and objective assessment of software quality. By monitoring the high-level technical quality of systems it is possible to immediately perform the necessary steps needed to reduce the effects of software erosion, thus reaching higher maintainability and lower costs in the mid and long-term. The tool measures source code maintainability according to the ISO/IEC 25010 based probabilistic software maintainability model called ColumbusQM. It gives a holistic view on software quality and warns on source code maintainability decline.

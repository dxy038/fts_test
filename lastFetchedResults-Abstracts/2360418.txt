The objective of this paper is to review our present understanding of the physical processes in lightning flashes during their development within or outside a cloud, following lightning initiation. This represents the ‘big picture’ of lightning development, in the scale of the cloud dimensions themselves. Since the acceptance of the bi-directional, zero-net-charge leader concept, significant changes have occurred in our understanding of the key physical processes of which a lightning flash is comprised, and in the analytical relationship between the electrical structure of a cloud and lightning parameters. These changes are discussed with an emphasis on the unifying nature of the bi-directional leader concept. To cite this article: V. Mazur, C. R. Physique 3 (2002) 1393–1409.

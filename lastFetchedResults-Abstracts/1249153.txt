The process parameters of aluminum alloy hot stamping are essential for product forming quality. In the case of an anti-collision side beam inside car doors, the finite-element model of aluminum alloy hot stamping is set up, and the forming quality is investigated under an ordinary process condition. The blank hold force (BHF) has a significant impact on the forming quality in hot stamping. Using the Latin hypercube method to sample the simulation data points and the finite-element (FE) model to calculate the forming quality indices of the data points according to the response value of the indices, the quadratic response surfaces between the process parameter inputs and the forming quality indices are initialized. Using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm) to optimize the responses of the process parameters, the Pareto solutions corresponding to combinations of the blank hold force and stamping speed are obtained. Finally, based on the optimal process parameters, stamping tests are carried out. Compared with the results of the stamping trial and numerical simulation, it is demonstrated that the finite-element model can predict forming defects and be consistent with the actual condition and that the optimization procedure proposed in the paper is feasible.

Objective(s): Gentamicin is used for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. However, gentamicin administration is limited because of nephrotoxicity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effect of crocin against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.
Materials and Methods: Thirty two male Wistar rats received gentamicin (100 mg/kg, IP), with or without crocin (100 mg/kg, IP) for seven consecutive days. Plasma creatinine and urea-nitrogen concentrations, oxidative stress and histopathological changes of kidney tissues were monitored.
Results: Administration of gentamicin resulted in significant increases in plasma creatinine and urea-nitrogen concentrations and renal tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and a decrease in the renal tissue ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) level. Crocin decreased plasma creatinine and urea-nitrogen concentrations and tissue MDA level, but increased the level of tissue FRAP. In addition, gentamicin led to cellular damages including glomerular atrophy, cellular desquamation, tubular necrosis and fibrosis, epithelial oedema of proximal tubules, perivascular edema, vascular congestion and intra-tubular proteinaceous casts, all of which were partially recovered by crocin.
Conclusion: Crocin has protective effects against functional disturbances, oxidative stress and tissue damages induced by gentamicin.

The ability of agents to learn is of growing importance in multi-agent systems. It is considered essential to improve the quality of peer to peer negotiation in these systems. This paper reviews various aspects of agent learning, and presents the particular learning approach—Bayesian learning—adopted in the MASCOT system (multi-agent system for construction claims negotiation). The core objective of the MASCOT system is to facilitate construction claims negotiation among different project participants. Agent learning is an integral part of the negotiation mechanism. The paper demonstrates that the ability to learn greatly enhances agents' negotiation power, and speeds up the rate of convergence between agents. In this case, learning is essential for the success of peer to peer agent negotiation systems.

Mechatronics is a rapidly developing discipline. Despite its short period of existence it has created a substantial contribution on our every day life. However, Mechatronic Engineering course did not achieve its uniqueness. It needs more and more research, and a lot of efforts to draw the skeleton of its course structure. This article investigates existing Mechatronics and Mechatronic Engineering courses of several universities and institutions worldwide. Course structures of a couple of universities are studied in details and are focussed on. It is concluded that courses developed and taught in several universities are far away from the real philosophy of Mechatronics and far away from its vital objectives as well. The main theme of this article is concentrated on philosophical concept development, as well as, indicating the essential goal of Mechatronics and Mechatronic engineering. The major supremacy of Mechatronic Engineering is involved in high level of intelligence of Mechatronic machines or systems. At present time it is believed that Fuzzy Logic Control supported by Neural Network can help to achieve the desired intelligence of Mechatronic systems. There is a vast distinction between automation created with the help of feedback control and Mechatronic intelligence. Only simple single purpose intelligence of machines does not satisfy the Mechatronics objective. Sustainability and manufacturability of intelligent machines are also focussed on in this article.

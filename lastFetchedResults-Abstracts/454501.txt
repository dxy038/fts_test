The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the cholesterol-lowering effect of fluvastatin on the incidence of cardiac events in hyperlipidaemic patients with symptomatic, clinically-diagnosed (exercise-ECG) coronary heart disease (CHD) during 1 year of treatment. Exercise tolerance, incidence of angina pectoris episodes, use of anti-anginal medication and intimal-medial-thickness (IMT subgroup) of the A. carotis were secondary endpoints. In the double-blind trial a total of 365 male and female patients with stable symptomatic CHD and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) above 160 mg/dl on a lipid-lowering diet were randomised to fluvastatin 40 mg (o.a.d. or b.i.d.) or placebo for 1 year. Fluvastatin lowered total cholesterol by 17% and LDL-C by 27%. There was a significantly lower incidence of cardiac events (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris) in the fluvastatin group (3 events) as compared to the placebo group (10 events) (P<0.05). Exercise tolerance improved and the incidence of angina pectoris episodes decreased in both groups, but more pronounced on fluvastatin (n.s.). Exercise-ECG discontinuation due to angina pectoris and ST-segment depression decreased in the fluvastatin group by 55.6 and 70.9%, respectively, and in the placebo group by 39.6 and 46.5% (n.s.). At baseline, a subgroup of 76 patients showed a mean IMT value of 0.73 mm which remained uninfluenced in the fluvastatin and the placebo groups. Fluvastatin was safe and well tolerated. In conclusion, patients with symptomatic CHD get cardiovascular benefit from lipid-lowering therapy with fluvastatin even during the first year of treatment.

This paper presents a report on the first stage of a research on the thermal analysis of spindle units with aerostatic bearings and an experimental investigation of temperature distributions. The objective of the present paper is to provide background information for further analysis. A test machine was used running to a maximum rotational speed of 20000 min−1 with a 60 mm diameter spindle supported by aerostatic journal bearings of 20 μm radial clearance, and the temperatures of the housing, bush and the interface between the bush and air film were measured. In addition, the inlet and outlet air temperatures, the air film pressures and the deformations of the housing and spindle were measured. The experimental results show that the heat flow pattern is essentially radial flow, although axial heat flow was observed. The circumferential temperature distribution can be considered to be uniform, and the temperatures are proportional to the square of the spindle speed.

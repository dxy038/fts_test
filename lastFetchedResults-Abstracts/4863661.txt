There have been many heuristic algorithms finding multicast trees proposed in the literature. The necessity for finding a better and more suitable algorithm is still topical and relevant. The paper presents a new multicast routing algorithm for finding a multicast tree in packet-switched networks. The objective of the proposed KSPMA algorithm is to minimize cost of constrained paths between the source and destination nodes using the generalized DijkstraÂ´s algorithm regarding maximum delay bound along each path. A wide range of simulation research carried out by the authors, for many network topologies and parameters, has confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

The aim of this paper is to introduce the idea of pattern recognition using optical memory. In order to reach such objective, this paper, for the first time, introduces the optical memory device, discussing its concepts, and comparing it against the digital and magnetic memory. It also discusses the implementation of the optical memory. Finally it explains the application of the optical memory to pattern recognition using image recognition as an example. The potential for application of the optical memory is found to be almost unlimited.

The terms of ICs factorial modelsÂ´ use in optimal circuit design procedures are considered in this paper. The ICs factorial models are the simplified models of circuits which are automatically synthesised on the basis of the design of computer simulation experiments with IC full mathematical model. Main destination of the synthesised factorial models is an effective search of trade-off solutions in the tasks of multi-objective optimization of IC. We consider the aspects of rightfulness of ICs output parameters approximation by bilinear and quadratic polynomials, the conditions of adequacy of ICs factorial models, their effectiveness on condition of complexity of ICs full model simulation.

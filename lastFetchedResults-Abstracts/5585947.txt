Application of fuse-blow and fuse-save schemes in distribution protection design entails a trade-off between SAIFI and MAIFI. In this paper, we present new binary programming models for SAIFI and MAIFI as a function of the location of reclosers and fuses in a radial distribution system. In these models, we defined the fault-clearing schemes at the fuse level rather than at the recloser level. We used a weighted sum of SAIFI and MAIFI as the objective function. We linearized the models, allowing us to set threshold values on SAIFI and MAIFI as optimization constraints. This formulation will be useful in performance-based regulation. Our definition of the fault-clearing scheme introduced new feasible solutions and depending on the weights and constraints, the new solution space may contain the new optimal solution.

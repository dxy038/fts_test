The regulation of human behavior by institutions can be deemed as a process of social choice, in which specific social choice rules attain the objective of institution design by governing human choices. This paper provides a new framework of institution design - institution design based on social choice, which avoids the &#8220;black box&#8221; dilemma in institution design. The paper discusses the key issues in the implementation of this new framework and proves its feasibility through a case study.

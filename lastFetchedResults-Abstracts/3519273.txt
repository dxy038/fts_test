A series of tests have been conducted on the combined active and reactive despatch algorithm presented in a companion paper. The ability of the algorithm to optimise the performance of the system and to maintain system variables and derived variables within their permissible limits is established. A further objective has been to assess the robustness and computational speed of the program. Five different objective functions have been tested, with the aim of investigating the impact on both generation fuel cost and security when different security measures are introduced alongside cost minimisation. These security measures are maximisation of reactive reserve margins, maximisation of load voltages, avoidance of voltage collapse, and improving the ability of the system to maintain higher system load. The overall objective function is a weighted combination of these various objectives

The objective of this meta-analysis of individual patientsâ€™ data was to compare the immediate outcomes of anatomic and physiologic repair of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. Eleven nonrandomized studies, involving 124 patients, met the inclusion criteria for this review. The Rastelli type anatomic repair and the era of surgery were significantly related to the outcome in different tested models. Entering all variables into the logistic regression model showed a significant protective effect of the Rastelli type anatomic repair (odds ratio = 0.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.01, 0.50, p = 0.02).

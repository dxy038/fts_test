In this paper, we study utility-based resource allocation for soft QoS traffic in infrastructure-based wireless networks. Soft QoS traffic here refers to the traffic which demands certain amount of bandwidth for normal operation but allows some flexibility when the given bandwidth is close to the preferred value. The resource requirement of soft QoS traffic can be described with sigmoid utility function. Our objective is to maximize the total utility of all soft QoS flows without going through a wireless bidding process. We develop essential theorems as the design guidelines for this problem, and then propose a sub-optimal, polynomial time solution based on the developed theorems. We prove that the difference in the performance of our mechanism and the optimal solution is bounded. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated via simulations. The results show that our solution can adapt to any types of soft QoS flows. Specifically, it acts like a hard QoS system and allocates resource in a fairness-oriented manner when the utility functions of flows are unit-step functions; on the other hand, when the utility functions are concave, it behaves like a best effort system and allocates resource in a throughput-oriented way.

At present, the assembly line balancing problem mainly lies in the fact that it is proceeded from the perspective of assembly time to conduct the study in time balance, which is difficult to cope with the dynamic changes occurring in the actual production. This paper, therefore, comes up with the optimized objective to minimize the assembly complexity relationship differentiation through the research into complexity of the assembly. Moreover, when combined with the optimization index multi-objective assembly line balancing research, it also puts forward the method of hybrid particle swarm algorithm to solve. The algorithm adopts topological sorting encoding based on operating elements of priority diagram, applies sorting and the number of niche to evaluate individuals, and it forms a new fitness function based on that. Besides, it introduces the thought of Simulated Annealing to expand the choice for Global Best to the entire procedure; the result of some cases can demonstrate the superiority of the algorithm.

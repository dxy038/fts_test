Principlism means creating an identity for harmonizing individual behavior and social institutions with the norms stemming from the divine commandments. The main objective of the discourse of Islamic originality is return to the Islamic roots and principles based on the tradition and mode of conduct of the Prophet of Islam. Principlism does not mean turning back to modernity and the modern world. The discourse of originality aims to confront begotism and extreme modernism. Contrary to the traditionalists and religious intellectuals who, with sincerity and in order to sanctify religion, through a minimal approach, interpret religion in a manner not to pit it against the worldly affairs and confine the field of religion to the otherworldly and spiritual affairs, the discourse of religious originality, while concerned about capability of religion, tries to bridge between tradition and modernity - world and hereafter.

Objective :A sensitive and accurate method has been developed for the determination of Dioxin by solid phase microextraction(SPME)coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometric detection(GC-MS). Method: Some factors influencing solid-phase microexaction(SPME) extraction efficiency such as extraction of time and temperature were studied. The result shows: with the extraction of time 30 min, temperature 45degC, Detection limit of the method is 0.05 pg/ul for TCDD. The relative standard devation(RSD) is less than 10%, and the result of detection of dioxin sample is 0.78 pg/ul. Conclusion: The method of solid phase microextraction is practicable and effective to analyze the quantity contained dioxin. The sample standards added in water were 90.4%-103.7%, the method is used to analyze practice water sample, the proposed method has the advantages of solvent-free sample preparation , simplicity of the procedure, good sensitivity and reproducibility, it provide a new method of testing dioxin.

Video processing always needs excessive computation which may cause large computing time and thus demands for heavy computing power. It also needs large storage resources and high bandwidth communication channels. Hence, the major objective of video signal processing is to reduce the amount of data computation and use the limited resource bandwidth to handle it. Regression polynomial coding (RPC) is a new compression method based on polynomial coefficients which shapes out the waveform of the block. The computation mechanism employed greatly reduces the computation with serial but not parallel processing, and it is proved that RPC is effective and suitable in low bit rate applications in the environment with limited bandwidth. With the aid of variable length coding to gain more compression, RPC would be a great technique for wireless communications

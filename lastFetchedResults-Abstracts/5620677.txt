There are two classes of evaluation methods of video quality: subjective and objective. Subjective tests on human viewers are used by convention but these are extremely time consuming, expensive, and require specialized laboratory conditions. This paper describes an objective method of video quality evaluation of MPEG-2 system that emulates human perception. Emphasis of this paper is placed on three-dimensional weighted SNR (3D-WSNR) and three-dimensional weighted block effect (3D-WBSNR). The experimental result has showed that, compared with physical peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and two-dimensional weighted SNR (2D-WSNR), correlation of objective evaluation results in this paper with subjective evaluation results is greatly improved

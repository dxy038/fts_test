Objective: This study assessed the ability of endovaginal ultrasonographically directed transvaginal drainage of pelvic abscesses to treat patients who failed intravenous antibiotic therapies and whose abscesses were not amenable to percutaneous or colpotomy drainage.
Study design: Thirty-one women who would otherwise have required surgery to treat their pelvic abscesses underwent the procedure. Immediate clinical response and longer-term follow-up results were collected retrospectively.
Results: Thirty-four procedures were performed on 31 women. Purulent material (10 to 350 ml) was aspirated in every case. Twenty-six of the 31 women (84%) were successfully treated by drainage. In the 6- to 21-month follow-up period, 10 women remained without problems, eight had sequeise related to pelvic infection, and eight were lost to follow-up.
Conclusion: Endovaginal ultrasonographically guided transvaginal drainage is a safe, effective procedure for treatment of pelvic abscesses and should be considered the route of choice for draining collections not amenable to percutaneous or colpotomy drainage.

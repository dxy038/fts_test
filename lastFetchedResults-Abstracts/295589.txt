Objective: The purpose of this article is to report our experience with hydrofluoric acid (HF) burns and to present our management guidelines for these burns, which include a novel way of delivering calcium combined with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) for cutaneous burns. Method: We reviewed our institutional experience from 1977 to 1999 for patients presenting with burns caused by hydrofluoric acid and collected data on age, sex, burn size, anatomical site, method of contact, surgical procedure, and outcome. Results: Of a total of 2310 admissions, 42 HF burns patients were identified during the study period. The average age was 34 years. There were 35 males and 7 females. Seventy-four percent of cases received burns to the upper limb. Median burn size was 1% of the total body surface area. Seventeen percent of patients required a surgical procedure. In 24% of cases, the method of contact was work related and 40% were injured using cleaning products at home or on boats. No deaths were recorded. Conclusion: HF injury is uncommon but problematic burns often requiring surgery. Recommended management: In cases of cutaneous exposure, treatment should commence immediately with 30 min lavage followed by application dimethyl sulphoxide 50% + calcium gluconate 10% in surgical jelly. If hand or forearm is affected, regional intravenous calcium ‘Bier’s block’ using 40 ml 10% calcium gluconate with 5000 U heparin in total final volume of 40 ml may be indicated. Subcutaneous infiltration may be indicated for elsewhere at 0.5 ml/cm2 burn of 10% calcium gluconate. Persisting pain may require nail removal or arterial calcium infusion.

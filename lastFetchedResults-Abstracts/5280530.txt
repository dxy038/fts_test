The increasing demand for wireless network services have resulted a plethora of studies on the efficient management of radio resources to improve network capacity. As radio spectrum is a scarce resource, sharing of radio frequency has to be considered among wireless network nodes and by doing so introduces interference among users, which in turn limit the network capacity. Our study addresses the problem of dynamically assigning channels in ad-hoc wireless networks via power control in order to satisfy their minimum QoS requirements. The objective then is to maximize the number of co-channel links subject to some stability conditions. In order to assign the optimal number of co-channel nodes that can co-exist over a wide range of operating SINR values, we propose two novel ways to find the optimal combination of co-channel links so that a feasible power vector can be found within its power limits.

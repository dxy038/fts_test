Optimal coordinated control of diesel generators (DGs) and battery storage system (BSS) was proposed. Basic block scheme of a stand-alone Microgrid was shown. Objective function of optimal fuel consumption at intervals of transient processes was obtained. Objective function takes into account not only the diesel engine characteristics of the fuel consumption, but also efficiency of power converters charge and discharge and BSS charge and discharge efficiency. An example solution for generator HATZ 1D81C was given.

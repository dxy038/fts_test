The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of Ginkgo biloba extracts (GBE) and of their flavonoid glycosides fraction (FA) on the in vitro digestibility of emulsion systems. A soybean oil-in-water emulsion (10 wt% oil) was prepared using GBE or FA particles as emulsifiers. We showed that the droplet size distribution in the FA and GBE particle-stabilized emulsions was monomodal with mean droplet sizes of 0.8 and 1.0 μm, respectively. Moreover, after storage, the emulsions were relatively more stable against coalescence than Tween 20-stabilized emulsions. Our emulsions were also compared to conventional Tween 20 (0.1 wt%)-stabilized emulsions in terms of their lipid digestion kinetics by using an in vitro digestion model at pH 7.0 and pH 8.9. At both pH conditions, lipolysis in the FA- or GBE-stabilized emulsions was appreciably slower, and the total concentration of released fatty acids was much lower than in Tween 20-stabilized emulsions. The flavonoids adsorbed at the oil-water interface could barely be displaced by Tween 20, even at high concentrations (0.3 wt%), suggesting that the slower lipolysis observed in FA- or GBE-stabilized emulsions could be a result of the strong and irreversible adsorption of FA and GBE particles at the emulsion oil droplets. Furthermore, the bioaccessibility of flavonoids in FA-stabilized emulsions (39%) was considerably higher than in GBE-stabilized emulsions (11%).

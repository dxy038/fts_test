Application of selective laser melting for manufacturing three-dimensional objects represents one of the promising directions to solve challenging industrial problems. This approach permits to extend dramatically the freedom of design and manufacture by allowing, for example, to create an object with desired shape and internal structure in a single fabrication step. The design of the part can be tailored to meet specific functions and properties (e.g. physical, mechanical, chemical, biological, etc.) using different materials. Metallic objects were manufactured by Phenix PM 100 machine from Inconel 625 powder. The objective was to analyze the influence of the manufacturing strategy on the internal structure and mechanical properties of the components manufactured by selective laser melting technology. Anisotropy of the internal structure and mechanical properties of the fabricated objects were studied.

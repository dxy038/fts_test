Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between an abnormal aortic isthmus blood flow index and postnatal neurodevelopmental outcome in fetuses with placental circulatory insufficiency.
Study design
Forty-eight children who were born between 1991 and 1999 were included in this study on the basis of abnormal umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry. Prenatal isthmus blood flow index was obtained by dividing the sum of the systolic and diastolic Doppler blood flow velocity integrals by the systolic blood flow integrals.
Neurodevelopmental outcome between 2 and 5 years was classified as optimal, when neurologic assessment and developmental quotient were within normal limits and as nonoptimal when abnormal neurologic findings and/or a nonoptimal developmental quotient was present. Neurodevelopmental outcome was analyzed in relation to isthmus flow index and pulsatility indices in the umbilical artery.
Results
The mean gestational age at delivery was 33.0 Â± 2 weeks. Nonoptimal neurodevelopmental outcome was found in 60.4% of the children (29/48). An inverse correlation was found between the isthmus blood flow index and postnatal neurodevelopmental outcome. All 13 children with an isthmus blood flow index of <0.5 were in the nonoptimal group. All 19 children with an optimal outcome had an isthmus blood flow index of >0.5, but this was also the case for 16 other children with nonoptimal neurodevelopmental outcome. An isthmus blood flow index cut-off value of 0.70 was associated with the highest overall positive and negative predictive values. The pulsatility index in the umbilical artery did not provide any significant contribution in the explanation of the outcome.
Conclusion
The isthmic blood flow index can help to identify a subgroup of fetuses with placental circulatory insufficiency that might benefit from early delivery.

VMODEX is an interactive visualization tool to support system-level Design Space Exploration (DSE). It provides insight into the search process of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) that are typically used in the DSE process, and therefore it facilitates the analysis of the DSE results. In our tool, we provide several capabilities to be able to handle large design spaces and filter design points according to their objective values to see only preferred solutions.

In this paper, a method for offline design of PI controllers is proposed. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to minimize the overshoot and settling time of speed responses of an induction motor drive system. The proposed method eliminates the need to specify weights for each objective. Therefore, the design process is simplified and the intervention of the designer is reduced. Both simulation and experimental results of proposed PI controller tuning method in IM drive are presented in the paper

This paper researches the scale of subjective speech quality measurement over VoIP (voice over IP) service which is a component of broadband networks. Though objective parameters of multimedia services like PSNR or jitter can be easily measured and defined, those factors do not easily met the users´ perceptual recognition. It is suggested that the scale of speech quality measurement through the subjective measurement is more adequate for end-to-end speech quality which is composed of sender-side quality, transmission quality, and receiver-side quality, and which provides the degree of correctness in speakers´ representation, the degree of impairment caused by various factors, and the degree of recognition of processed speech, respectively. It is also examined by the proposed method and verified by its availability

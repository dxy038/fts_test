The main objective of this paper is solving the problem of voltage variations of Hybrid Photovoltaic/
Fuel cell at different conditions. Because of valuable advantages of hybrid DG power
systems, using from these power systems become more and more prevalent. But there are some
defects that cause the application of DG power system unacceptable. One of these deficiencies
relates to the malfunction of energy sources. For example, during shaded conditions the output
power of PV arrays reduces to negligible values or by stopping the correct electrochemical process
of fuel cell, it cannot deliver power to the grid. The other problem of Hybrid Photovoltaic/
Fuel cell is that there is not enough reactive power for delivering to the load and this cause the
voltage reduction of DG power system. To solve mentioned problems, in this survey, it is suggested
that by applying SMES system and D-STATCOM, active and reactive power can be provided
to the load, respectively. But, adding these elements to the power system at the same time
needs to an efficient controller. In this paper, multivariable control strategy as an efficient method
which can regulate the voltage of the DG power system busses with an appropriate dynamic
is selected to design the controller. Generally, in this paper, after designing one standard Hybrid
PV/Fuel cell DG power system, by adding the elements of SMES system and D-STATCOM, the
voltage of the proposed system is regulated at different conditions and this fact is approved via
simulation tests.

Throughput maximization is generally the major objective when allocating resources in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)networks. Traditionally, dynamic allocation methods were developed to exploit multi-user diversity in these networks. These techniques achieved significant gain in throughput by adopting relaxed convex models to define system upper bound capacity. Frequency diversity, on the other hand, is only considered to a certain extent in order to meet user service constraints. The vast majority of existing research relies on these techniques. Separately, research considering combining frequency diversity and multi-user diversity in full has been scarce. The results of our research in this paper show that using this dual diversity combining can substantially maximize system capacity and resource efficiency, and minimize outage probability whilst usersÂ´ quality of service (QoS) demands are maintained.

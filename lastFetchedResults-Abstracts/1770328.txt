Environmental protection has become one of the main concerns in developed economies, which
is why an increasing degree of commitment in the field is required from all public and private bodies. Environmental
protection in firms must cease to be a secondary, barely profitable objective, involving the performance
of sporadic remedial actions, and become just one more element of their organization which, though it may
require investment, may also provide a firm with major opportunities and cost reductions. This paper looks
at the latest trends in expenditure on environmental protection by industrial firms. The information available
is from the Spanish National Statistical Institute (INE), provided for the Spanish regions. Then, using shiftshare
analysis, we will seek to ascertain whether there are competitive advantages and each regionâ€™s degree of
specialization in the main lines of expenditure.

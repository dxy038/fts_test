Combining with the characteristic of hazardous waste, this paper develops a multi-objective mathematic model for the location of treatment sites and transfer sites for hazardous wastes. Based on the fuzzy satisfactory levels of objectives, it proposes a two-phase fuzzy algorithm. Through solving the model, it conducts an analysis on the locations and numbers of these sites and how to assign the generation sites to transfer sites. Therefore, a reverse network for hazardous waste is constructed Finally, it takes Tianjin Economic-technological Develop Area (TEDA) in Tianjin city in China as a case to prove the availability of the fuzzy model.

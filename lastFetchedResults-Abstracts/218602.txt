Objective: This study is an attempt to examine the anti apoptotic effects of BIO on rat
MSC culture.
Materials and Methods: Rat marrow primary cell culture was established and exposure
groups were defined; cultures with 0.01, 0.1, 1 mu M BIO. Cells cultured without BIO
treatment were used as controls. During culture expantion, the average doubling time,
as an index of the rate of cell growth, were determined and compared. To examine
whether or not BIO is able to protect MSCs against apoptosis, the passaged-3 cells
from each group were induced to undergo apoptosis with the addition of TNF-alpha (Tumor
necrotic factor-alpha). Three days after, the cultures were quantified in terms of the percentages
of apoptotic cells using either the Tunnel or Annexin V staining method.
Results: Marrow cells cultivated with 0.1 and 1 mu M BIO appeared to expand at a significantly
more rapid rate than the 0.01 Ù‰M BIO and the control cultures (p<0.05). Tunnel
staining indicated that in 1 mu M BIO-treated groups, there were lower percentages
of apoptotic nuclei than in groups with other concentrations of BIO (p<0.05). The BIO
protective effect appeared to be dose-dependent in that the cultures with high BIO content
possessed less apoptotic nuclei. The results obtained by Annexin staining were in
agreement with the results of Tunnel staining. The Annexin method additionally takes
into account the early apoptotic cells which are not detectable by the Tunnel method.
Conclusion: Taken together, it seems that cultivation with BIO could both increase the
growth rate of marrow cells and protect MSCs against induced apoptosis.

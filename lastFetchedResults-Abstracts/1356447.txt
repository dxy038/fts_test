Objective: In human beings, the balance control is a result of an
integration of physical and psychological factors and people show
different reactions when feel anxious or face stability threatened
conditions such as standing on an unstable surface. University students,
particularly the female ones, are a group of the society who are prone to
face anxieties. The current study focused on the effects of anxiety on
balance index in young female university students .
Methods: A group of 15 female students with a high anxiety score (higher
than 42 in Shpielberger Questionnaire) and a group of 15 female students
with a low anxiety score (lower than 42 in Shpielberger Questionnaire)
were recruited for this study. Using a Biodex stabilometer (Biodex
System, USA), the antero-posterior (AP), medio-latral (ML) and the
overall dynamic stability index (SI) of the subjects were recorded and
compared .
Results: The results revealed a significant difference between the two groups. Subjects with a high anxiety score showed a stability index higher than those in the low anxiety group (p < 0.005), which simply indicate significantly less stability in this group.
Conclusion: This study showed that subjects with higher anxiety scores were less stable compared to those subjects with lower anxiety scores.

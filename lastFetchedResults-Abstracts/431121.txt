Background
Giant paraesophageal hernias (GPEH) have traditionally required open operations. Increasingly, a laparoscopic approach is being applied to more complex esophageal surgery. Our objective was to update our growing experience with laparoscopic repair of GPEH.
Methods
We performed a retrospective review at our institution of patients undergoing laparoscopic repair of GPEH from July 1995 to July 2001. The GPEH was defined as greater than one-third of the stomach in the chest.
Results
Elective laparoscopic repair of a GPEH was attempted in 203 patients. Mean age was 67 years. The most common symptoms included heartburn (96 patients), dysphagia (72), epigastric pain (56), and vomiting (47 patients). Laparoscopic procedures included 69 Nissens, 112 Collis-Nissens, and 19 other procedures. There were three open conversions due to adhesions, but no intraoperative emergencies. Median length of stay was 3 days (range, 1 to 120 days). Minor or major complications occurred in 57 patients (28%). There were six postoperative esophageal leaks (3%), and 1 death. Median follow-up was 18 months. Five patients required reoperation for recurrent hiatal hernia. Excellent results were reported in 128 (84%) patients, 12 (8%) had a good result, 7 (5%) fair, and 5 (3%) poor (based on postoperative follow-up and GERD questionnaire). The mean postoperative GERD Health-related Quality of Life Score was 2.4 (scale 0 to 45; 0 = no symptoms, 45 = worst).
Conclusions
Laparoscopic repair of GPEH is possible in the majority of patients with acceptable morbidity, a median length of hospital stay of 3 days and excellent intermediate-term results in an experienced center.

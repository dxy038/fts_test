This paper presents some of the results obtained for a case study on reliability in a job shop manufacturing. A mixed integer programming approach was used to present a linear objective function to form manufacturing cells which result in higher system reliability level, improved productions quality, less manufacturing costs, and some implicit consequences. Each part could choose one of the predetermined routings which leads to less transportation costs and less breakdowns. Stability of manufacturing system provides conditions to implement quality tools effectively. Two real case studies and 11 random problems in a wide spectrum have been solved by the proposed model and the results were compared against the existing model using lingo software. Results indicate that this model can be used to solve problems and reach global optima in lesser time and even solve large scale problems which could not be solved by the existing models in a reasonable time.

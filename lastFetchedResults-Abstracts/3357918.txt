A new conception called optimal cost-effective solution is introduced for N-person cooperative game. This solution is not only Pareto optimum but also superior to the conventional NashÂ´ arbitration solution relative to Nash equilibrium strategy on the whole. It is to insure the individual rationality for all the players. This method gives a new and simple way for solving N-person cooperative game. It is also equivalent to the solution of a single objective programming. Finally, several examples are presented to demonstrate the results.

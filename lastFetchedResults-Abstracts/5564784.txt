The objective of this paper is to investigate, both theoretically and experimentally, the limits on maximum pulse energy from a fiber-grating-based all-fiber system and to reveal methods for improving and optimizing its overall performance. We have found that for fiber gratings manufactured in a standard single-mode fiber the pulse energy limit is of the order of 20-50 nJ, which is on the same level as from currently available bulk, large-frame femtosecond lasers. This demonstrates the potential of this compact all-fiber design for generating high-power ultrashort pulses.

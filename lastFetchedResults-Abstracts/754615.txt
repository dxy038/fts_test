This paper deals with the zeros of polynomials generated by a certain three term recurrence relation. The main objective is to find bounds, in terms of the coefficients of the recurrence relation, for the regions where the zeros are located. In most part, the zeros are explored through an Eigenvalue representation associated with a corresponding Hessenberg matrix. Applications to Szeg√∂ polynomials, para-orthogonal polynomials and polynomials with non-zero complex coefficients are considered.

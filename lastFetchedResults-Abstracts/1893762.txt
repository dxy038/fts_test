The basic objective is to develop a simpler method of preparation of the colloidal CdS nanoparticles with greater stability and to study interaction with tyrosine molecules. Average size of the particles in the colloid is found to be about 3 nm as probed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. Effect of both sulfide enriched CdS as well as Cd2+ enriched CdS on tyrosine is investigated both through absorbance and emission spectroscopy. Quenching of tyrosine emission followed Stern–Volmer relation and was found to be independent of temperature, indicating possible static quenching. However, Förster transfer between tyrosine and CdS can be suspected to mimic static quenching in addition to the charge transfer complexes. In the presence of Cd2+ enriched CdS nanoparticles, the emission of tyrosine in phosphate buffer shows typical spectral broadening and a long wavelength increase in fluorescence emission. This may be attributed to the sensitized emission of CdS itself.

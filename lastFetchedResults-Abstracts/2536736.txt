Malnutrition is a common problem among elderly patients, especially
                            those with heart failure, and is known to increase mortality rates. The
                            current study evaluated nutritional status to identify changes in the
                            elderly patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) during hospital
                            stay. This cross-sectional study recruited 225 CHF hospitalized elderly
                            patients, comprised of 154 males (68.4%) and 71 females (31.6%) at a
                            mean age of 71.1 Â± 7.35 years. The mini nutritional assessment (MNA) was
                            performed to estimate functional, cognitive and nutritional status. The
                            MNA, an18-item tool to evaluate subjective and objective findings,
                            including anthropometric measurements for nutritional risk, is found to
                            be sensitive, specific and accurate in identifying elderly people at
                            nutritional risk. According to the MNA questionnaire, 9.8% of the
                            elderly were malnourished, 80.9% at risk of malnutrition and 9.3% well
                            nourished. Weight loss, bedsore, and level of knowledge and income had a
                            significant relationship with nutritional status based on the MNA (P
                            value &lt; 0.05). Considering the high percentage of elderly
                            patients with malnutrition or at risk of malnutrition, the need for
                            nutritional intervention is obvious. The MNA seems to be a reliable tool
                            to identify individuals at risk of malnutrition. To decrease hospital
                            stay duration and cost, application of the MNA is suggested.

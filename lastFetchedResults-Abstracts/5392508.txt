In this paper, we study the control problem and note that it is multi-objective by nature, and thus we develop an optimal multi-objective approach. Our approach includes formalizing components and identifying dimensions, resulting in few cases for concrete problem formulation. For a selected case, namely the finite control case, a single-objective from the literature and our multi-objective solutions are presented. It is demonstrated that the multi-objective solution avoids drawbacks of the single-objective solution, particularly the need for defining single objective out of many

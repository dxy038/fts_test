Background and Objective: Multiple choice questions (MCQs) is the most common method for evaluation of students in higher education sectors especially universities of medical sciences. This method could be a valid tool in assessing the students, if the questions are prepared accurately and according to standard test criteria. This study was undertaken with the aim of investigation of structural flaws of MCQs designed for residency promotion exam in Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences.
Subjects and Methods: In this cross-sectional study a total of 2400 MCQs designed for residency examination were analyzed for structural flaws and cognitive levels taxonomy. Each MCQ was examined using a prepared standard structural framework by assessors, structural flaws were determined. The MCQs were then, categorized into cognitive levels I, II, or III according to Bloom's taxonomy. SPSS software was used for data analysis.
Results: Four hundred and two MCQs out of 2400 (16.8%) showing structural flaws, the most common ones were: grammatical flaws in both stems and options (20.4%); using negative stems (18.4%) and non-identical options lengths (18.4%). Among total tested MCQs, 71.9% were designed at lower cognitive level (taxonomy I), while only 28% belonged to higher cognitive levels (taxonomies II and III).
Conclusion: The prepared MCQs, contained structural flaws and basically were at lower Bloom's taxonomy. Therefore, it seems that designing MCQs of residency examination needs to be revised and reformed.

This is Part I of a two part paper dealing with control design in power systems using the method of normal forms. In stressed power systems, due to the presence of increased nonlinearity and the existence of nonlinear modal interactions, there exist some limitations to the use of conventional linear control design techniques. The objective of this work is to understand the effect of the nonlinear modal interaction on control performance and to develop a procedure to design controls incorporating the nonlinear information

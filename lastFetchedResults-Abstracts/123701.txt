To reduce the environmental and economical impact of soil erosion resulting from improper management of land-use activiles, this research was initiated on Syahrood, one of the sub-basins of Damavand watershed in Iran. Land-use optimization is one of the appropriate strategies for soil conservation. It can empower the decision-maker of watershed manger to choose from different land -use scenarios to reach the best decision between the different combinations of variables. The output results of the sediment yield model, including the integration of MUSLE with SPANS-GiS, along with the net income of each land use were used as input in the land - use optimization model for minimizing the sediment yield and maximizing farm production of each land use. The multi-objective linear progarmming simplex method was used to generate an exact representation of the noninferior set by moving mathematically from one noninferior extreme point to adjacent points until all points have been found. The optimization process allocated dryland -farming areas to rangelands if no changes are made to the current supporting practice system. The expected annual sediment yield from the entire sub-basin was reduced by 2420 t/y (or by 5%) and the annual net farm income was increased by 3.99 billion Iranian Rial/y (or by 134%).

In this paper, a new approach based on the
particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed
to tune the parameters of the Constant Maximum Boost
control method for the Z-Source Inverter (ZSI). The
purpose of utilizing PSO technique is to minimize Total
Harmonic Duration (THD) output voltage of ZSI. The
design problem of the Constant Maximum Boost control
method is converted to an optimization problem with the
time-domain-based objective function which is solved by
a PSO technique which has a strong ability to find the
most optimistic result. The Matlab/Simulink was used to
verify the effectiveness of proposed control method. The
simulations results prove that the Constant Maximum
Boost optimized PSO algorithm has excellent ability in
minimize THD output voltage toward Constant
Maximum Boost.

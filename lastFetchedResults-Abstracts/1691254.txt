Inroduction & Objective:  Diabetes is a metabolic resulting from defects in insulin secretion and function. Pomegranate is a nutritional substance, used in traditional medicine to treat diabetes. In the current study we checked the treating effects of the pomegranate juice on diabetes and its side effects on liver. Thus, in the current study investigated the effects of pomegranate juice on liver enzymes (ALT, ALP, AST) in diabetic and non-diabetic rats.
Material and Methods: In the current study, 90 adult male Wistar rats weighing 200 to 220 g each were randomly selected and divided to five groups of control(without any intervention), sham (distilled water), experimental diabetic and non â€“diabetic1,2 and 3 groups (4cc of pomegranate juice (PJ)). Diabetes was induced in rats by intraperitionesl injection of 60 mg/kg of streptozotocin. In the experimental groups, rats were treated for 21days with a signal dose of pomegranate juice for each day. At the end of the day 21, a blood sample was taken from the experimental and control group and were measured the serum levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP). The data were evaluated using ANOVA and LSD.
Results: Results showed that pomegranate juice reduces significantly liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP) in the diabetic group than in the control group and the control group had no significant effect.
Conclusion: Pomegranate juice with flavonoid and antioxidant compounds and also due to decrease blood glucose levels causes enzymes of ALT, AST and ALP in diabetic rats.

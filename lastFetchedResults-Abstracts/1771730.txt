The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) transcatheter valve therapy (TVT) registry is a novel, national registry for all new TVT devices created through a partnership of the STS and the ACC in close collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Duke Clinical Research Institute. The registry will serve as an objective, comprehensive, and scientifically based resource to improve the quality of patient care, to monitor the safety and effectiveness of TVT devices, to serve as an analytic resource for TVT research, and to enhance communication among key stakeholders.

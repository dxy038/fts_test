Previous studies suggested that the implementation of note-taking strategies impacted students´ learning process and performance. Research also suggested that collaborative learning facilitates students to learn from different views of interpreting information. The objective of this study was to investigate students´ metacognitive skills and social networks while using electronic and paper-based enhanced guided notes. Students´ worked in groups of three or four to complete the EGN. The impact of the collaborative note-taking activities on the students´ collaboration processes was examined using social network analysis. Our findings revealed that students´ cognitive and metacognitive strategies between electronic and paper-based EGN groups were relatively similar. Our data analysis of students´ social networks revealed two clusters of students, high and low groups that represented the level of students´ connectivity in a collaborations network. The findings suggested that the high group outperformed students in the low group in the use of cognitive, monitoring, and regulating strategies. Implications of the use of collaborative note-taking in engineering classroom will be discussed.

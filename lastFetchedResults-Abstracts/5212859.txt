Modified maps are widely used for a variety of purposes such as in tourist guides to help people find geographical objects using simple figures. However, modified maps might become problematic if they contain inaccurate information. This is because most modified maps are not updated with dynamic real-world information, and they might contain incorrect or superfluous information in that some objects on the map are intentionally enlarged or omitted. We propose a deformation analyzing method based on geographical accuracy using the map information and surrounding text. In other words, our proposed method detects the tolerance level of a deformation by the objective of the modified map. We assume that there exist three types of spatial contexts for modifying maps: general oriented map, path oriented map, and position oriented map. We also assume that deformation analysis involves looking at a modified mapÂ´s geographical accuracy and Web page according to the spatial context. In this paper, we describe deformation analysis based on the geographical accuracy of the modified map and how much they differ from the spatial context of the modified map.

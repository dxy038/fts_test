 The objective of this study was to investigate the underlying laryngeal mechanisms during the specific human 4-kHz vocalization. The laryngeal configuration during this vocalization was measured using high-resolution computerized tomographic scan and videostrobolaryngoscopy. The color Doppler imaging (CDI) of medical ultrasound was used to detect the vibrations of glottal and supraglottal mucosa. During the 4-kHz vocalization, the ventricular folds were adducted in the shape of a bimodal chink and the vocal folds were shaped as a â€œVâ€‌ with an opening at the posterior glottis. In the coronal view, the laryngeal ventricles had collapsed and a divergent shaped conduit was observed at the posterior portion of the larynx. The surface mucosa vibration detected by CDI was noted over the bilateral ventricular folds and aryepiglottic folds. The vibration displacement was estimated to be on the order of 0.1آ mm. This vibration amplitude was too small to be detected in videostrobolaryngoscopy. The laryngeal configuration and CDI data suggested a diffuser jet with periodic vorticity bursts in the larynx producing 4آ kHz voice.

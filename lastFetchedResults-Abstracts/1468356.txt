Introduction & Objective: BTEX compounds (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Xylene iso-mers) are among the most consumed and dangerous volatile organic compounds which can cause adverse health effects in humans.  The water pipe smoke contains numerous toxic compounds such as BTEX compounds.The aim of this study was to evaluate the personal exposure to BTEX compounds at traditional restaurants of Hamadan.
Materials & Methods: This cross sectional study was descriptive- analytical. To sample the BTEX compounds in the air inhaled during smoking of 25 people at 12 traditional restau-rants, the NIOSH 1501 method was used, and the samples were analyzed by gas chromatog-raphy.
Results: The mean duration water pipe per serving was 52.23±9.28 min. The mean tempera-ture and relative humidity at the traditional restaurants were 33.24±1.72° C and 35±0.095%, respectively. The mean concentration of Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl Benzene,O,M and P-xylene in  the exhaled air ofthe subjects were 1495, 2806, 2559, 810, 932 and 1146 ppb, respec-tively.
Conclusion: The concentration of Benzene, Toluene and Ethyl Benzene in subjects' inhaled air  during smoking was more than the limit determined by Environmental Protection Agency. In this study we found  that water pipe smoke can cause absorption of high levels of BTEX compounds through inhalation and can be considered as one of the main sources of exposure to these compounds which is followed by the increased risk of adverse health ef-fects.

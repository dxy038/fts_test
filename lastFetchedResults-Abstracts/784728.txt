Objective: Our objective was to determine how patient demographics and outpatient referrals to
specialized dementia (DEM) or mental health (MH) clinics influence receipt of anti-dementia (AD),
antidepressant (ADEP), antipsychotic (APSY) and sedative-hypnotic (SEDH) medications among veterans with
dementia. Design: Retrospective, cross-sectional observational study. Setting: Veterans Affairs Maryland Health
Care System (VAMHCS). Participants: Veterans aged ≥ 60 years with Alzheimer’s or related dementia
diagnosis after 1999 with minimum of one-year follow- up or death were included. Measurements: Retrospective
analysis of VAMHCS electronic medical records were used to determine predictors of AD, ADEP, APSY, and
SEDH prescribing using logistic regression models that examined visits to DEM or MH clinics, patient age,
follow-up time, race/ethnicity and marital status. Results: Among 1209 veterans with average follow-up of 3.2
(SD 1.9) years, 36% percent had MH visits, 38% had DEM visits and 19% visited both clinics. DEM visits were
associated with AD and ADEP but not APSY medication receipt (OR(AD:DEM) = 1.47, 95% CI = (1.052,
2.051); OR(ADEP:DEM) = 1.66, 95% CI = (1.193, 2.302); OR(APSY:DEM) = 1.35, 95% CI = (0.941, 1.929)).
MH visit was associated with ADEP and APSY medication receipt (OR(AD:MH)\ = 1.16, 95% CI = (0.821,
1.631); OR(ADEP:MH) = 2.83, 95% CI = (2.005, 4.005); OR (APSY:MH) = 4.41, 95% CI = (3.109, 6.255)).
Conclusion: In the VAMHCS dementia population, visits to DEM or MH specialty clinics increase the odds of
receiving AD, ADEP, and APSY medications.

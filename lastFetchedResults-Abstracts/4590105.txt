This paper discusses the principle and performance of direct single-mode-fiber-coupling FSO terminals which can provide multi-gigabit wireless communications under the various adverse weather conditions, such as strong atmospheric turbulences and rains. By using high performance bidirectional beacon tracking system and diffraction-limited refractive optics design, the terminals have demonstrated power effective and reliable wireless links.

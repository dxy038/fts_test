A single-phase-to-three-phase converter for a low-cost AC motor drive is proposed. The converter employs only six switches and incorporates a front-end half-bridge active rectifier structure that provides the DC link with an active input current shaping feature, which results in sinusoidal input current at close to unity power factor. The front-end rectifier in the converter permits bidirectional power flow and provides for excellent regulation against fluctuations in source voltage, facilitating regenerative braking of the AC motor drive. A control strategy that maintains a near-unity power factor over the full operating range and is easy to implement is described. Suitable design guides for the selection of filter components are presented. Simulation and experimental results that verify the developed theoretical models are also presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

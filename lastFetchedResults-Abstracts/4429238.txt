Semantic network is the development direction of the world wide web, and it converts the traditional system and the abstract one-dimension table into the associations between semantics through ontology construction, one party for the separation of field data and operating data while the other party to provide new starting point for further researches on field data and business logic reuse. At present the remote education theory put forward the new demand for the management of knowledge base and business logic reuse. We also made progress in the study of the ontology construction, semantic database management and other areas, so itÂ´s up to date to achieve a remote education system prototype based on the semantic network. The thesis is about the development of OntoLearning remote education system prototype. OntoLearning is a remote education network system of multilayer based on Web layer, service layer, business application layer, integrated layer and resource layer. It is a main function module covering teaching, file management, objective establishment, and progress management of remote education system, of which the ontology through RDF language briefly describes the semantic relations of teaching management of each party.

Ambient intelligent as a kind of context aware system refers to an environment that is sensitive to attendance of persons in one restrict area also able to satisfy needs and doing information system. Uncertainty always is unavoidable factor in all context-aware systems. Ambient intelligent as a context-aware system has different aspects of uncertainty. The objective of this study is scrutiny roots of different kind of uncertainty those are present in ambient intelligent. The most important spatial aspects of uncertainty in ambient intelligent includes uncertainty originated from error in positioning of user ,uncertainty originated from ambiguity in clear definition of intelligent limits, inconsistency between sensors information and deficiency in data. Considering different kind of spatial uncertainty in ambient intelligent, we will show that spatial uncertainty modeling is unavoidable in this system. According to our implementation, an ambient intelligent complexity increased and leads to decreasing efficiency but with considering spatial uncertainty existing condition modeled better and become more realistic.

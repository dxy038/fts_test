Conflict-free routing is an important problem to be addressed in AGV systems, in particular when they are bidirectional. This paper presents a multi-agent approach that solves this problem. The main idea of this algorithm is to consider an AGV as a reactive agent, whose goal is to reach a predefined destination without conflict with the moving AGVs. The proposed multi-agent approach is compared in a simulation study to another predictive method

Objective
We investigated whether gene transfer into hematopoietic cells could be achieved by direct injection of retroviral vector supernatant into the bone marrow space of newborn sheep.
Materials and Methods
Six sheep (5 weeks old) were injected bilaterally with either 1 mL of G1nBgSvNa8.1 vector supernatant (titer: 1 Ã— 107) in each hip (n = 5) or with 3 mL of the same vector preparation/hip (n = 1). In addition, one 3-month-old sheep was injected unilaterally with 1 mL of the same vector preparation. Blood and marrow of these animals were analyzed for the transgene before injection and at intervals thereafter.
Results
At 1 week postinjection, an average of 11.6% of the lymphocytes and 25.5% of the granulocytes/monocytes in the marrow, and an average of 0.9% of the lymphocytes and 1.8% of the granulocytes/monocytes in the blood contained and expressed the LacZ gene. The presence/expression of the transgene has persisted for at least 13 months within the blood and bone marrow of these animals.
Conclusions
These findings demonstrate that the direct injection of small volumes of high-titer retroviral supernatant into the bone marrow of newborn sheep results in transduction of hematopoietic cells that persists for at least 13 months postinjection.

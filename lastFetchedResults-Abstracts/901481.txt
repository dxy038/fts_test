ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Obesity in children increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Since the prevalence of obesity is growing worldwide and in Iran, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of fatty liver disease in obese children who were referred to pediatric clinic of Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 306 obese children aged 4 to 18 years was done. Demographic data, type of milk in infancy, weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure were recorded. Liver ultrasonography for sonographic evidence of fatty liver disease was performed and laboratory measurement including fasting blood glucose, insulin, serum lipid profile and liver enzymes was done.  
FINDINGS: In this study, 306 obese children (178 girls and 128 boys) with a mean age of 9.55±3.2 year enrolled. Fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasound in 163 (53.3%) of children (92.5% had grade1 and 7.5% grade 2 fatty liver). The average body mass index (BMI) was 24.6 ±3.3 in subjects without fatty liver and 27.6±4.6 in fatty liver grade1, and 29.6±4.4 in fatty liver grade 2 subjects. Children with fatty liver disease had higher level of insulin, triglycerides and SGPT and lower level of HDL.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that over half of obese children had fatty liver disease. According to the high prevalence of obesity and fatty liver disease, it is appropriate to apply methods for change in lifestyle and diet and new studies should be designed for treatment of fatty liver disease.

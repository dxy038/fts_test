This paper presents an environment-centered approach to design multi-agent solutions to transportation problems. Based on the property-based coordination principle (PbC), the objective of our approach is to solve three recurrent issues in the design of these solutions: the knowledge problem, the space-time dimension and the dynamics of the real environment. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, two completely different applications, a demand-responsive transportation system and a simulator for crisis management, both based on this principle are presented. For each of them, we show how these recurrent issues have been solved.

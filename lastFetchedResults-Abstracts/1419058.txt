The objective of this work is to analyse the characteristics of a fixed-geometry thrust bearing in typical operating conditions and to give experimental results in order to validate future thermohydrodynamic models. The influence of the applied load, the rotational speed and the feeding temperature on the thrust bearing performance is presented and discussed.

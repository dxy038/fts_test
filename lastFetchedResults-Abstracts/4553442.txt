This work investigates loss location and loss magnitude manipulation via slip gain tuning in indirect field oriented induction machine drives. By using finite element analysis (FEA), the spatial distribution of the losses and the extent to which the distribution is manipulated via control tuning of the slip gain is investigated. Practical slip gain tuning variations across the full operating range, such as low speed when convection-based heat transfer is less effective, as well as high speed, are investigated. In addition, the dynamic performance corresponding to loss location manipulation tuning is investigated and documented. In this work, it is seen that using inadequate slip gain for field orientation reduces the total rotor losses within the machine. There is an opportunity to balance the shift of rotor loss to stator loss with the marginal degradation in torque dynamic performance when the slip gain is reduced for loss location manipulation. This work leads to a systematic method for understanding how loss location and magnitude change as a function of indirect field oriented controller tuning, with a goal of expanding the controller tuning paradigm to add a loss location objective to the classical dynamic torque performance objective.

This paper presents the use of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm applied to the optimal design of the 4/2 switched reluctance motor (SRM). The main advantage of designing 4/2 SRM is the robust rotor structure for high speed unidirectional rotating applications such as the air conditionerÂ´s blower. In the designing process, the finite element method magnetics (FEMM) is also employed to analyze the designing SRM with its optimized parameters given by PSO. This PSO algorithm is efficient and flexible. The objective function is based on the ripple torque minimization with respect to rotor node position. The PSO algorithm is described and the preliminary FEMM simulation results will be given for verifying optimal rotor design by PSO algorithm. In the final paper, the complete FEMM simulation results with detailed analysis will be provided.

LUZ SOLAR Programme has been designed as a larger-scale implementation of photovoltaics in rural pre-electrification in the Brazilian southeastern state of Minas Gerais. The purpose of this paper is to describe the program, the experiences (technical and social), and the future plans for rural electrification with this utility. Several successful demonstrations have shown that PV can be reliable and cost effective in remote rural areas, and especially effective in improving quality-of-life for the users. The primary objective is to facilitate the access of lower-income people to education, lighting, communication, and (in some cases), potable water. A special feature is the close participation/collaboration of users and prefectures in the project in order to improve consumer acceptance and to ensure the effectiveness of the program. Experiences with system design improvement, performance, user training, maintenance user-acceptance, financing, and reliability are presented. The model used for installation and maintenance is discussed, including the social, legal, and financial aspects to deploy the technology

The objective of this project was to design an underwater camera and instrumentation system that could be used to detect and follow moving objects, and be able to be deployed at a depth of up to 100 m for an extended period of time. This was achieved by using a pan, tilt and zoom high resolution camera connected to a base station via a powered fibre optic cable. The camera was successfully deployed for 100 days continuously, recording video on to a DVD recorder in real time.

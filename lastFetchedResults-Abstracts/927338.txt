Objective: Various prosthodontic techniques are used for treatment of implant patients. Fabrication of a cement-retained prosthesis on a screw-retained framework is among these techniques. This type of prosthesis is usually indicated for implants that have been insertedobliquely or in an improper position. Easy retrieval, repair and maintenance are the main advantages of this type of prosthesis. The present articledescribes a method for fabrication of implant supported prosthesis. In this prosthesis, separate crowns are cemented on a screw-retained framework. The metal framework is coated with gingival-colored porcelain in order to support soft tissue. 
Case: Our patient was a completely edentulous 56 year-old female suffering from severe bone loss as the result of long term use of dentures. The bone resorption was so severe that the normal ridge contour could not be restored even after extensive ridge augmentationusing iliac crest bone graft. Thus, a combination of cement-retained and screw-retained prostheses was selected as the treatment of choice for this patient. 
Conclusion: This technique combines the advantages of both screw-retained and cement-retained prostheses in terms of function and esthetics. Also, despite the hardly-accessible location of the screw access channel in the framework, assessment of implants is always feasible by unscrewing the metal framework. Additionally, the fabricated crowns can be easily repaired or replaced without the need for unscrewing the framework.

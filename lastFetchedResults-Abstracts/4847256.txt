Considering center distance and gear facewidth, establishing the optimized objective function and constraint equation of properties, while optimizing the data by utilizing the Matlab optimization tool box, it is discovered that, through analysis of the outcomes compared with the original design data, the optimized objective value has reduced by 24.77%, and the centre distance by 15%, in contrast to the initially set.

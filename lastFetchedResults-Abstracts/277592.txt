Objective
To test the force plate as a gait analysis system for broilers and to determine how the ground reaction force (GRF) patterns change in these birds with growth and administration of analgesia.
Materials and methods
Thirty-three male Ross 308 chicks were raised on either an ad libitum or restricted-feeding regime, and subsequently treated with carprofen or a placebo. Vertical, craniocaudal and mediolateral GRFs were measured as the birds walked across a standard force plate.
Results
The data were easy to collect, and peak vertical forces of an equivalent percentage of bodyweight as seen in human walking were identified. Mediolateral forces were 2â€“3 times greater than those demonstrated in other species. GRF patterns showed significant changes during growth, but analgesia did not have a significant effect on the speed of walking, or GRF patterns.
Conclusions and clinical relevance
The force plate is a suitable research tool for recording GRFs from avian bipeds. The large mediolateral forces identify a particularly inefficient aspect of avian gait; however, the role of pain remains to be determined.

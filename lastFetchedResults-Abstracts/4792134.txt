This paper describes objective video quality validation efforts conducted in the past two decades. Validation efforts to be examined include a validation test performed by the T1A1 committee in the early 1990Â´s; five rounds of validation testing performed by the Video Quality Experts Group; and validation tests performed by ITU-T Study Group 12. Useful products that resulted from those efforts will be identified, including standards, datasets, and model validation techniques.

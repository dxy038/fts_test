The main objective of this study was to design a MISO (Multiple-Input Single-Output) fuzzy logic controller with a CPLD as the control core (CPLDIFLC). An automatic sprinkler system was adopted as an example for modeling experiential rules that regulate the professional operation of automatic sprinkling in a flowerbed. This model was presented in the form of a CLPD circuit. The main component of a fuzzy logic controller include the fuzzification interface, knowledge base, decision- making logic and defuzzification interface. This approach design the fuzzification interface with the truth table, design the database and decision logic with decoder, ROM and comparator, etc., design the defuzzification interface with multiplier, adder, divider and truth table, etc. According to the design method may realize a fuzzy logic controller very much easily.

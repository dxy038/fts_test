Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the attitudes of medical students toward psychiatry and their
intention to pursue psychiatry as a career; and to determine if they change after psychiatric attachment. It also
examined the relationship between the students' characteristics and their attitudes in details.
Methods: Pre and post-surveys using Likert-type scales were conducted versus 106 medical students of
Ahwaz Jondishapour University who entered psychiatric attachment between spring 2007 and spring 2010. They
completed a demographic form and an "attitude toward psychiatry" questionnaire with two excess questions
which measured their intention to pursue psychiatry as a career in future.
Results: The majority of students appeared to have favorable attitudes before the attachment which improved
during the course; but they didn't show significant change in their intention to pursue psychiatry as a prospective
career. There was a significant correlation between age and change in attitudes. Also the career intention was
significantly correlated with their attitudes.
Conclusion: The study confirms previous reports that training can change students' attitudes toward
psychiatry, but contrasting with them suggests that negative attitudes are not likely to be the main cause of the
low career intention to psychiatry. Thus, teaching psychiatry can get the students rid of their negative attitudes
but is not enough to encourage them to pursue psychiatry as a career. The authors suggest it is based on poor
opportunities for postgraduates in the field and social stigma attached to psychiatry, which needs further studies.
Declaration of Interest: None.

This paper presents a novel method based on pre-processing prior to intermediate view interpolation to synthesise an intermediate view as would be viewed by a virtual camera located along the baseline joining the two stereo video cameras. The objective is to achieve virtual eye contact for immersive videoconferencing. An energy minimisation method based on graph cut is used to obtain a disparity map used for interpolation of the virtual camera view. A simple linear interpolation method is applied to synthesise the virtual view. Perfect eye contact is achieved for Head and Shoulder stereoscopic video sequences. We evaluate our method by using variety of standard stereoscopic video test sequences.

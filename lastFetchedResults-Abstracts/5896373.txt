Processing of colour image data using directional information has received increased attention lately due to the introduction of the vector directional filters. The objective of this paper is to survey the different vector directional filters already in use focusing on their similarities and differences. Simulation studies involving colour images are used to assess the performance of the different vector directional filters, and to compare them with other commonly used nonlinear filters

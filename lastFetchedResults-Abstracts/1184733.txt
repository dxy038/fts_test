The objective of this research was to investigate the combined effect of polyaminoamide-epichlorohydrin (PAE) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) on the mechanical properties of tissue paper made from virgin pulp. Three levels of CMC (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5%), and three levels of PAE (0%, 0.5%, and 1%) based on the dry weight of the fibers were used. A mixture of 60% short fiber and 40% long fiber pulps was formed by mixing bleached softwood and bleached hardwood pulps provided by Latif tissue making plant and the chemicals were added. Then 80 g/m2 laboratory hand sheets were prepared. All samples were placed in oven at 100±5 °C and also conditioned (23±1°C and 50±2% relative humidity) for 24 hours prior to testing. Strength properties (wet and dry tensile, wet and dry burst) of the hand sheets were measured. Results indicated that treating of pulps with both CMC and PAE as additives leads to enhancement of the mechanical properties of the paper sheets and higher dosages of CMC and PAE, improved all strength properties.

Key words: Tissue paper, PAE, CMC, tensile, burst.

The paper points out that there exist some disadvantages for current FACTS devices, and presents a method of multi-function integrated FACTS devices with two different ways. Based on STATCOM and DC deicer-SVC system, single FACTS device adopting multi-objective controlling is elaborated. Based on UPFC and SFCL-MES, combining strategy of FACTS devices is elaborated. In the end, the paper explores some key features of ChinaÂ´s smart grid, including ultra-high voltage transmission with long-distance and heavy-duty, safe operation of large receiving-end grid, the improvement of quality of power supply, the traction system of electric railway, and distributed generation system. Combined with these features, the author puts forward some of key multi-function integrated FACTS devices that should be developed in the smart grid of China.

The objective of this work was to contribute to decontaminating the environment, and to solving the housing shortage in our country. The technological products developed in this research are sustainable from the ecological, technical and economic points of view. The developed products were panels for housing and equipment. They were manufactured by recycling plastic materials from food, perfumery or cleaning packaging, waste production from factories due to failures in sheet thickness or ink application. It thus contributes to decontaminating the environment, since most of this waste is buried in municipal land without any use, or accumulated and burned in landfills, causing environmental degradation.

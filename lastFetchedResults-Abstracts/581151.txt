Background and Objective: The main purpose of this study was to compare the effects of Carbohydrate and Carbohydrate-Protein supplements on heat shock protein 72(HSP72) during intermittent soccer activities.
Materials and Methods: 24 soccer players of super clubs were selected and divided into 3 groups of carbohydrate (CHO), carbohydrate-protein (CHO-PRO) and placebo (P). Intermittent activities included 24 trials of modified Ekblom tests or soccer simulation activities. Subjects ingested drinks before, during and 1 hour after intermittent activities. Blood samples were collected before (baseline), immediately, 1 hour and 24 hours after simulated intermittent activities. HSP72 levels, Insulin and blood Glucose counts, were measured using Elisa Kit.
Results: The results showed significant differences in HSP72 levels, Insulin and blood Glucose levels, immediately and 1 hour after intermittent activities of CHO and CHO-PRO groups compared to placebo group (p ? 0 /05). But, there was no significant difference between CHO and CHO-PRO group. In addition, significant increases in HSP72, Insulin and blood Glucose were shown immediately and 1 hour after intermittent activities in CHO-PRO, CHO and P compared to baseline.
Conclusion: The results indicated that ingestion of carbohydrate with additional protein before, during and 1 hour after soccer simulation intermittent activities did not attenuate HSP72, Insulin and blood Glucose compared to when the carbohydrate was ingested alone. While, in both CHO-PRO and CHO groups significant differences were shown in HSP72, Insulin and blood Glucose levels compared to P group. Thus, glucose availability during exercise affects the circulating HSP72 response in soccer players.

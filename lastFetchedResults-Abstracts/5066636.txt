This paper introduces a new automatic image enhancement technique based on real-coded genetic algorithms (GAs). The task of the GA is to adapt the parameters of a novel extension to a local enhancement technique similar to statistical scaling, as to enhance the contrast and detail in the image according to an objective fitness criterion. We compared our method with other automatic enhancement techniques, like contrast stretching and histogram equalization methods. Results obtained, both in terms of subjective and objective evaluation, show the superiority of our method

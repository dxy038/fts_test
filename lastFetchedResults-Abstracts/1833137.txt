Human chromosomal region 3p12â€“p23 is proposed to harbor at least three tumor suppressor genes involved in the development of lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, andother neoplasias. In order to identify one of these genes we defined sequence tagged sites (STSs) specific for 3p13-p24.2 by analyzing a chromosome 3p14 microdissection library. STSs were used for isolating yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) YAC libraries. Thirty-eight YACs were assembled into a contig approximately 2.5 Mb in size spanning the t(3;8) and t(3;6) translocation breakpoints associated with hereditary renal cell carcinoma and hematologic malignancies, respectively. Chromosomal localization and chimeric status of 126 YACs was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The order of 17 YACs determined by double-color FISH was in agreement with the STS-based arrangement of the YAC-contig.

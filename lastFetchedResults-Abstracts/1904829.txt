Abstract
Objective: National sport development demands collaboration and support of stakeholders involved in national sport so that sport development programs conduct by these stakeholders. But to carry out the programs, organizations deal with a challenge of organizational legitimacy. Therefore this study intends to design model for providing stakeholders’ interests of Ministry of Sports and Youth emphasizing on organizational legitimacy.
Methodology: The Research method was corelational research. For data gathering, literature review, structured interview and questionnaire were used. In the interview session, the conceptual model, the variables and the their relationships among were discussed with 22 managers and experts. Sampling method was stratified. Two groups of stakeholders as primary (national sport federations) and secondary (private sectors involved in sport) were chosen. The research instrument was a questionnaire with optimal validity and reliability values. Structural equation modeling was used for model designing.
Results: Research findings showed that stakeholders’ capability of management (=B 0/80, p =0/001), adaptive culture (=B 0/32, p =0/001) and organic structure (=B 0/29, p =0/001) significantly influenced provision of stakeholders’ interests. Also, adaptive culture (=B 0/46, p =0/001) and organic structure (=B0/33, p=0/001) significantly affected stakeholders’ capability of management. In addition, Influence of provision of stakeholders’ interests (=B 0/59, p =0/001) on organizational legitimacy was significant.
Conclusion: Based on structural equation model, contextual factors (adaptive culture, organic structure) did not have a direct and positive effect on the provision of stakeholder interests. Thus, the final research model can offer useful understanding about the influnce of research variables for stakeholders.

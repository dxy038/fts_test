In this paper, we present a novel approach for power control in a multi-user data transmission system. The main objective of our approach is to distribute the overall transmission power among the lines in a way, such that a certain ratio between the bit rate of the lines is achieved. Given the maximum transmission power per line and the ratio of the bit rates both the transmission power and the achievable bit rate for each line are found by an iterative optimization. We show the impact of our novel power control in an experimental section, where the approach is used for finding the transmission power for a ten-line VDSL-2 system with various bit rate distributions.

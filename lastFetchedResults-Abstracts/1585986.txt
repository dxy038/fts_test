Machining is a dynamic process involving coupled phenomena: high strain and strain rate and high temperature. Prediction of machining induced residual stresses is an interesting objective at the manufacturing processes modelling field. Tool wear results in a change of tool geometry affecting thermo-mechanical phenomena and thus has a significant effect on residual stresses. The experimental study of the tool wear influence in residual stresses is difficult due to the need of controlling wear evolution during cutting. Also the involved phenomena make the analysis extremely difficult. On the other hand, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool used to simulate cutting processes, allowing the analysis of different parameters influent on machining induced residual stresses.

m of this work is to develop and to validate a numerical model to analyse the tool wear effect in machining induced residual stresses. Main advantages of the model presented in this work are, reduced mesh distortion, the possibility to simulate long length machined surface and time-efficiency. The model was validated with experimental tests carried out with controlled worn geometry generated by electro-discharge machining (EDM). The model was applied to predict machining induced residual stresses in AISI 316 L and reasonable agreement with experimental results were found.

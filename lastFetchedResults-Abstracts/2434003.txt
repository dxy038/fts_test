In this study, we introduce simultaneous effects of learning and linear deterioration into assembly line balancing problem. In many realistic settings, although the actual task time of a task is modeled as an increasing function of its starting time due to deterioration effects the produced worker(s) (or machine(s)) develops continuously by repeated the same or similar activities. The objective of problem is to minimize the station number. For this purpose, a mixed nonlinear integer programming model is developed. This paper also discusses the adaptation of the COMSOAL approach for large scale assembly line balancing problem with deterioration task and learning effect.

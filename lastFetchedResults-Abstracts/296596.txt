Background
Anhydrous ammonia (AA), a chemical commonly used in agriculture, is a key component in illicit methamphetamine production. Although injuries associated with AA exposure are well studied, AA injuries associated with incidents during illicit methamphetamine production have not been adequately described in the literature.
Objective
This study better characterizes AA injuries occurring in an agricultural region where illicit methamphetamine production is common.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional study based on a chart review of 49 patients who were admitted to a tertiary hospital in Illinois with known or suspected exposures to chemical agents. Indices of morbidity were compared between injuries resulting from exposure to AA and injuries from other chemicals, and between AA injuries from incidents during illicit methamphetamine production and AA injuries from other causes.
Results
AA was the most common cause of chemical injury (41%; n = 20/49). Incidents during illicit methamphetamine production were the most common cause of AA injury (75%; n = 15/20). AA injury was associated with significantly greater morbidity compared to non-AA chemical injury. In addition, methamphetamine-related AA injury was associated with significantly greater morbidity compared to non-methamphetamine-related AA injury.
Conclusion
Chemical burns during illicit methamphetamine production were the most common cause of both chemical and AA-related injury in our agricultural population and these injuries were associated with greater morbidity during hospitalization

Summary
A complex bidirectional relation between migraine, mostly migraine with aura (MA), and ischaemic stroke is known. A cerebral infarction can occur during a MA, and MA is a risk factor for ischaemic stroke, particularly in young women. Conversely, cerebral ischaemia can induce MA. Both ischaemic stroke and MA might be consequences of many underlying vascular disorders. Despite the relation between migraine and stroke, migraine as a primary headache disorder is mostly benign.

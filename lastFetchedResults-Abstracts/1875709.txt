OBJECTIVE: To explore the structure of symptom distress in women with advanced lung cancer

: Descriptive.

G: Oncology clinics and private offices.

TS: Sixty women with advanced lung cancer (71% non-small-cell); the majority received palliative treatment (88%).

E MEASURE: Symptom Distress Scale and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale.

: Factor analytic techniques (principal components, varimax rotation) to investigate combinations of all symptoms in the Symptom Distress Scale and combinations of serious symptoms.

S: Fatigue, disruptions in outlook, frequent pain, and difficulties in sleeping were rated the most distressing and were the most prevalent serious disruptions. A four-factor solution for the symptom distress ratings explained 63.3% of the variance and revealed groups of items representing emotional and physical suffering, gastrointestinal distress, respiratory distress, and malaise. Symptoms with a rating of serious distress were represented by five factors with emotional and physical suffering as separate factors. Symptoms were significantly related to Karnofsky Performance Status.

SIONS: Multiple symptoms formed distinct congregations of distress. Symptom control requires consideration as a multivariate approach.

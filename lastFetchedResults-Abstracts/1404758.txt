Background and Objective: Allergy can present with involvement of different organs. In this study symptoms and signs of patients with defined allergy to pollens were investigated.
Materials and Methods: Patients who had positive skin tests to at least one allergen were enrolled to study. They were visited and evaluated for symptoms and accompanying disorders. The season of symptom appearance or exacerbations were also assessed. Then associations of symptoms and complications with skin test results were analyzed by SPSS soft ware. 
Results: Four hundred and six patients from 502 cases were accepted to take part in our study. Pollens were common allergens (82%) among them weeds (61.3%) was the most common. After nasal symptoms that was the most common, otitis media, urticaria and conjunctivitis in patients who were sensitive to weed, tree and grass respectively, were more common problems. There was significant association between weed allergy and rhinitis and conjunctivitis; especially in late spring and summer. Tree allergy was seen in 60.1% of patients and there was positive association between tree allergy and ocular symptoms especially in spring and early summer. Two hundreds and forty three (59.9%) patients had positive skin tests to grass. It was the most common in children and youth and it was significantly associated with ocular symptoms in spring and summer.
Conclusion: Considering the high prevalence of sensitization to outdoor allergens in our area; instructions for pollen avoidance and appropriate medication in pollen seasons, could be beneficial for disease control.

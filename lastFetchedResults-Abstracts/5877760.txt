This paper presents a narrow pulsed voltage generator along with an ultrasound generator for liquid food sterilization. The generator is derived from a bidirectional flyback converter with leakage energy recovery circuits, which can improve efficiency about 12%. In addition, the proposed generator is associated with a half-bridge inverter for generating ultrasound to clean sterilizer electrodes. In this combined generator, the switches in the converter and the inverter are integrated with the synchronous switch technique, reducing its weight, size and volume while improving efficiency significantly. Experimental results obtained from a prototype with the output voltage of plusmn 6 <i>kV</i>~plusmn 20 <i>kV</i> and peak power of 1.2 <i>MW</i> have verified its feasibility.

Objective: To investigate the effect of Turmeric extract on rats acute myocardial ischemia model. Method: rats acute myocardial ischemia model, detect the SOD of blood plasma red blood cell and the content of SOD in tissue with SOD kit to reflect the level of SOD in tissue cells, to understand the produce rate of oxygen free radical in vivo and the degree of peroxidation action in lipid. Conclusion: The turmeric extract can increase the content of SOD in blood serum and myocardium tissue of rats acute myocardial ischemia model.

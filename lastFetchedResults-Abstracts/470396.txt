Objective
The United States food supply has been fortified with folic acid since 1998. Information about folate levels early in pregnancy before the fortification is limited. This study examined the associations between serum folate at first prenatal visit and maternal race/ethnicity, age, vitamin use, and body mass index.
Study design
This cross-sectional study assessed serum folate levels among 9421 women who entered prenatal care in 1999 and 2000 in southern California. Information on race/ethnicity, vitamin use, weight, height, and age was obtained from surveys and birth certificates.
Results
After adjustment for vitamin use, the strongest predictor of serum folate level, being in the lowest folate quartile (â‰¤16 ng/mL) was related independently to being of black, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific Islander race/ethnicity, being younger age, and being overweight or obese.
Conclusion
After food fortification with folic acid, differences in serum folate values in pregnant women by maternal race/ethnicity, age, and body mass index persisted.

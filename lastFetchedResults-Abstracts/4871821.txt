In general, power electric device is fed by AC/DC rectifier rather than by direct DC source and the inherent default of the rectifier has more bad influence on the power network. As a result, the PWM-rectifier has been paid more and more attention for unity input power factor, greatly reduced input line current harmonic distortion and bidirectional power flow capability. The paper present the topology of the main circuit, deduce the math model both in a-b-c and a - /spl beta/ reference frame, propose the direct current control scheme, get the current and voltage waveform and analyze the result of simulation which is processed by SIMULINK software on the base of math model.

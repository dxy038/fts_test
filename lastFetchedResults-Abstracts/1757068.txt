The objective of this epidemiological study was to determine whether cysticercosis and especially neurocysticercosis is endemic in Soutou village about half a century after the 1962 outbreak. This study was carried out from September 2009 to February 2010. It involved a questionnaire administration, serology, treatment, coproscopy and neuro-imaging. Four hundred and three serum samples were collected from the village people, which covered 94% of the village population. By using a parallel combination of the antigen-detection ELISA and the enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) a cysticercosis seroprevalence of 11.9% (95% CI: 8.9–15.4%) was found. Cerebral CT-scans showed that 23.3% (10/43) of the seropositives were affected by neurocysticercosis. Four out of these 43 (9.3%) were tapeworm carriers. Seropositivity was significantly associated to older age groups (41–60 years old; p = 0.001 and 61–91 years old; p = 0.028) and absence of a household toilet (p = 0.001). It can be concluded that Soutou village is an active focus of Taenia solium cysticercosis about 50 years after the first reported epidemic outbreak.

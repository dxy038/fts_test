This paper describes a technique for design under uncertainty based on the worst-case-scenario technique of anti-optimization. When anti-optimization is integrated with structural optimization, we create a nested optimization problem, which can be very expensive to solve. The paper demonstrates the use of a technique alternating between optimization and anti-optimization which alleviates the computational burden. The method is applied to the optimization of a simply supported laminate composite, to the optimization of a simple beam problem with nonlinear objective function, and finally to the optimization of a more complex real-life composite sandwich structure.

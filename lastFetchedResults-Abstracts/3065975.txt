In this paper a region-based color image watermarking algorithm is presented. The objective of the method is to embed a particular message in each region of interest (ROI) in the image. The embedding message has to be detected after image manipulations such as cropping, rotations and color JPEG compression. By using shape information, the embedding message is synchronized with each ROI on each color component Y, Cr and Cb. To embed information non-rounded DCT coefficients are watermarked. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the algorithm against spatial and frequential attacks.

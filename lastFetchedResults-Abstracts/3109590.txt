In CNC systems of metal-cutting processes the machining variables (e.g., the cutting speed and feedrate) are prescribed by the part programmer. The determination of these variables depends on experience and knowledge regarding the workpiece and tool materials, coolant conditions, and other factors. The main idea in adaptive control is the improvement in production rate and of part quality by calculation and setting of the optimal variables during the machining itself. This calculation is based upon measurements of process variables in real time and is followed by a subsequent on-line adjustment of the machining variables subject to constraints with the objective to optimize the performance of the overall system.

The objective of this paper is to apply the concepts and theories of global impact based on a modern formulation in which the impact is considered with sliding, adherence or transition between sliding and adherence. The energy dissipated in the contact may be quantified by different definitions of the coefficient of restitution in Newton’s law and Poisson’s law. The method is applied to the impact between the damper (parabolic elements) and the platform of the blades in an airborne gas turbine. A numerical solution is calculated using a computer program constructed on the Matlab Platform.

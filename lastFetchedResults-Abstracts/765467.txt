The F.E. analysis of woven composite reinforcement
forming is an alternative to geometrical draping
computation. It permits to account for mechanical behaviours
of the fabric and static boundary conditions of the
process. In this paper, macroscopic forming simulations of
woven composite reinforcements are performed using finite
elements composed of woven cells, the mechanical
behaviour of which are computed by F.E. analyses at
mesoscale i.e. on the unit cell of the fabric. The objective is
to only calculate the relevant quantities in the woven finite
element. The in-plane biaxiale tensile behaviour and the
in-plane shear behaviour are obtained by 3D analyses of
the woven cell submitted respectively to tension and shear.
They need to take the specificities of the mechanical
behaviour of the yarn (made of thousand of fibres) into
account. Especially an objective derivative based on the
fibre rotation is used. These computations on the unit
woven cell have proved to be consistent with experimental
tests. An example of deep drawing of a square box using
the proposed approach is presented. Angles between warp
and weft directions are computed as well as wrinkles.

Abstract
Introduction: Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a colorless gas used as a tissue fixative to preserve cadaver. New research shows formaldehyde in rats leads to an increase in plasma opioid internalized, which inhibits gonadotropin secretion and reduces Gonadotropin releasing hormone secreted from the hypothalamus. Survival of testicular germ cells is dependent on the presence of gonadotropin and its decrease leads to apoptosis of the cells. 
Objective: Evaluation of possible changes in gonadotropins and apoptosis of testicular germ cells in rats after formaldehyde gas exposure.
Materials and Methods: This experimental study was performed on 24 male adult, 7 -week -old Albino Wistar Rats. The rats (based on exposure time) were divided equally into two experimental groups consisting of: E1(4 days a week, 2 hours daily) and E2(4 days a week, 4 hours daily) and a control group. Rats in experimental and control groups were killed under anesthetic conditions after 18 weeks. Serum concentration of FSH, LH and testosterone and apoptosis of testicular germ cells were measured by Immunoradiometric assay(IRMA) and TUNEL assay, respectively.
Results: Results showed significant decrease of FSH, LH and testosterone in E2 group, in comparison with that in control group(p < 0.05), while no significant difference was observed in apoptosis of testicular germ cells index in comparison with control group (p=0.31). 
Conclusion: Although formaldehyde gas in the above mentioned concentration and conditions led to a significant decrease of gonadotropin hormones in rats, it has no significant effect on the apoptosis of testicular germ cells. Thus, it seems that apoptosis of testicular germ cells in adult males rats isn't just related to gonadotropin hormones and other factors may be influential in this process.

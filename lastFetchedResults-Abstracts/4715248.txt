Since the 1980s electrostimulation is used to accelerate the healing of fractures and bone defects. In prior works this effect has been implemented in a numerical model of an electrostimulative hip revision cup which was optimized using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The aim of our simulations is to design an implant which provides optimal electric fields in the acetabular region enhancing the reconstruction of the pelvic bone in such way as to improve the fixation of the prosthesis in the surrounding bone. In the present work we will show that this multi-objective algorithm can also be used to identify a small amount of configurations of the implant that will be able to stimulate a wide range of pelvic bones with different acetabular defects.

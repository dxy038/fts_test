Soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr) seeds contain isoflavones that have positive impacts on human health. The objective of this study was to determine isoflavone concentrations of early maturing soybean cultivars grown in different environments and to determine their relation to other important seed characteristics. Twenty soybean cultivars were grown in replicated trials at two sites in Montreal, Canada in 2002/2003 and their total and individual isoflavone concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Seed yield, 100-seed weight and oil, crude protein and crude fiber concentrations were concurrently determined. Total and individual isoflavone concentrations were significantly affected by cultivar, site and year. Total isoflavone concentration ranged from 360 to 2241 (mu)g g^-1 and averaged 851 (mu)g g^-1 across environments and cultivars. Variation across environments ranged from 20 to 100% for specific cultivars. Total isoflavone concentration was, on average, 40% greater in 2003 than 2002, which was characterized by above average temperatures and severe drought. Despite significant cultivar × year × site interactions, cultivars with consistently high and low isoflavone concentrations across environments were identified. Weak but significant positive correlations were observed between total isoflavone concentration and seed yield, 100-seed weight and crude fiber, indicating that isoflavone concentration is positively associated with other desirable seed characteristics.

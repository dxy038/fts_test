Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) although an infrequent otologic symptom. PT can be objective (auscaltable) or subjective (non-auscultable). It has been suggested that subjective PT could occasionally be associated with vascular disorders such as arteriovenous malformation, traumatic or spontaneous carotico-cavernous fistula, intracranial aneurysms, vascular tumors of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle, fibromuscular dysplasia, cervical venous hums and high jugular bulb. To our literature knowledge, it has not been reported subjective PT due to extensive pneumatization of temporal bone around internal carotid artery (ICA). In this report, we present a case of subjective PT, which was caused by resonance due to extensive pneumatization of temporal bone particularly peripheral to the ICA.

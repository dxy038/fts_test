A novel procedure, concepts, and new ideas to tailor and design time operators under the notion
of algorithms by design is formulated in this exposition with emphasis on applications to the broad
area of computational mechanics, but with focus on solid and structural mechanics/dynamics as an
illustration. The algorithms by design concepts capitalize upon: (i) the recently developed unified
theory underlying computational algorithms (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2004; 59:597–668), and (ii)
newly established design spaces and algorithmic measures for evaluating the quality of computational
algorithms (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2005; 64:1841–1870). As a step in the forward direction,
in this exposition we embark upon some challenging tasks with the objective to advance, tailor,
and foster the design of computational algorithms for time-dependent problems with desired and/or
improved algorithmic attributes in the sense of accuracy, stability and other characteristics including
algorithmic complexity in a well educated manner. The design process for computational algorithms
is explained in the sense of the algorithms by design concepts via selected numerical illustrations of
practical scenarios encountered in solid and structural mechanics/dynamics applications

The objective of this paper is to present a numerical simulation tool that can be used as an aid in the interpretation of the C-V characteristics of thin-film solar cells. The example simulations presented here are for a ZnO/CdS/CuInSe<sub>2</sub> solar cell, but the simulation tool can be used for a variety of solar cells, including CdTe. Model equations for the simulation of the small-signal behavior of semiconductor devices are presented. Sample simulations incorporating these small-signal equations into a detailed numerical model are interpreted

Whereas evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms have successfully been used in a wide range of real-world application tasks, difficulties in their scalability to many-objective problems have also been reported. In this paper, first we demonstrate those difficulties through computational experiments. Then we review some approaches proposed in the literature for the scalability improvement of EMO algorithms. Finally we suggest future research directions in evolutionary many-objective optimization.

In this paper, we introduce a decentralized autonomic architecture for multi-tier applications deployed in cloud environments. The architecture maintains the application´s service level objective at a predefined level and, implicitly, reduces the cost. The architecture uses a series of autonomic controllers, in which each controller independently regulates a tier of the application. The architecture utilizes feedback loops and implements Proportional, Integrative and Derivative control laws at each autonomic controller. A prototype is described and an initial set of experiments is conducted on a public commercial cloud. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach at maintaining a service level objective through the decomposition of an application´s aggregate performance into its set of discretely managed component tiers.

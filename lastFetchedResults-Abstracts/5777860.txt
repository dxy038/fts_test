In recent years, the rapid development of trade and traffic in our country has resulted in the increasing occurrence of various types of disasters and emergency injuries. According to the statistics from Fire Departments of Taiwan, medical emergency dispatch frequencies have exceeded 300,000, and the frequency of medical emergency dispatches has increased each year. These figures reflect the phenomenon that, despite the continual growth and progression of the community, various accidents and unforeseen situations are becoming increasingly common. Therefore, fire units have established a medical emergency care system with the objective of minimizing injuries, patient suffering, and the risk of mortality, reducing social medical costs, and alleviating the financial burden of medical emergencies on families. Many countries have special medical emergency dispatch systems, but these do not meet Taiwan´s rules and emergency procedures. Thus, our research has focused on compiling a symptom-based medical emergency dispatch guide designed to match Taiwan´s medical emergency dispatch system. We collate national medical emergency dispatch guides and present a medical emergency dispatch system to support medical staff and to educate these staff on the correct methodology in a short time. This system achieves the following objectives: (1) to enhance the quality of medical emergency services in Taiwan, (2) to reduce the response time of medical emergency dispatch, (3) to reduce the unnecessary waste of medical resources.

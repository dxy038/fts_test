Introduction: The importance of optimal clinical nursing
education in professional skills development is undeniable.
In clinical education, nursing students are often faced with
problems. Recognizing nursing students’ perception on clinical
education is the first step to remove the barriers of this challenge.
Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted
to determine the nursing students’ perspectives on clinical
education. 150 nursing students were selected randomly from
nursing and midwifery schools (Tehran). Data collection
instrument was a researcher made questionnaire consisting
of five domains: objective and curricula, instructor, feedback
to student in clinical field, clinical environment, supervision
and evaluation. Mean and standard deviation were calculated
for each item, using SPSS, ver. 14. Chi-square test was used to
compare the nursing students’ perspectives on clinical education
based on age, sex and the work experience. The significance level
was considered 0.05.
Results: Mean age of the students was 21.58±26.97 students (66%)
were male. 44 students (30.1%) had work experience (3.58±6.48
month). Male and female students had different perceptions in
domains of clinical education (p < 0.05). Nursing student had
different perceptions as to objectives and curricula (p=0.039),
how to deal with students in the clinical environment (p=0.032),
supervision, and evaluation (p < 0.001) with respect to their work
experience duration. The most positive responses were in clinical
instructor (81.5%) and the most negative ones were the clinical
environment (33.66%), respectively.
Conclusion: Providing an optimal clinical environment and
improving the supervision and evaluation of student practice
should prioritized in schools of nursing and midwifery.

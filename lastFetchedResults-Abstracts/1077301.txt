The main objective of this study is to investigate value engineering and its impact on the dimensions of organizational performance in the Water and Wastewater Administration of West Azerbaijan Province and present guidelines for the successful implementation of value engineering in order to enhance organizational performance in the mentioned office. The theoretical framework of the research is based on S.Iyer’s value engineering operational model as well as Kaplan and Norton’s operational model of organizational performance. In the regard, one main hypothesis and four minor hypotheses have been put forward. The statistical population consists of 375 staff members of the Water and Wastewater Administration of West Azerbaijan Province, from among whom a sample of 190 was selected through the use of Cochran’s formula and stratified random sampling technique. The measurement tool is a questionnaire, which was distributed among the subject. Before testing the hypotheses, the researchers used Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in order to evaluate the normal distribution of the variables. The results showed that the variables of value engineering and organizational performance do not have a significant difference from the normal distribution. Thus, for data analysis within the parametric statistics frame, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and linear regression were used. The results indicated that about 0.287 of the changes in the dependent variable (organizational performance) and its four dimensions (personnel satisfaction, customer satisfaction, organizational effectiveness, and financial results of the market) are accounted for by the changes in the independent variable (value engineering), which is also the indicator of the positive and direct relationship between the two variables.

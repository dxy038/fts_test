OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to compare several prolapse-reducing techniques during urodynamic evaluation and prospectively evaluate their usefulness in identifying the incidence of low urethral closure pressure in continent patients with massive prolapse. STUDY DESIGN: This preoperative, prospective, repeated-measures urodynamic study evaluated the maximum urethral closure pressure with the use of four different techniques in 30 consecutive continent patients with grade 4 prolapse at all vaginal sites. Twenty patients with grade 0 prolapse served as the control group. All patients from the prolapse group underwent surgical treatment and were followed up clinically for a minimum of 1 year. RESULTS: Use of the Scopette (Birchwood Laboratories, Eden Prairie, Minn.) reduction technique to reduce the prolapse in a linear orientation during multichannel urodynamics revealed a 56% incidence of low-pressure urethra and an overall genuine stress urinary incontinence of 83% in patients with massive pelvic organ prolapse but without clinical urinary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: There may be an increased indication for sling urethropexy in patients with massive prolapse.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:14)

Objective
m of the present paper was to assess whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inhibition of salivary secretion involves the activation of the endocannabinoid system and the participation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α in the submandibular gland.

cological approaches were performed by using CB1 and/or CB2 cannabinoid receptor antagonists, AM251 and AM630, respectively, injected into the submandibular gland, to study the participation of the endocannabinoid system in LPS inhibitory effects on metacholine-induced salivary secretion. To assess the participation of TNFα on LPS inhibitory effects, salivary secretion was studied in LPS treated rats after the intraglandular injection of etanercept, a soluble form of TNF receptor which blocks TNFα action. Finally, to evaluate the possible interplay between endocannabinoids and TNFα on the submandibular gland function reduced during LPS challenge, the salivary secretion was studied after the intraglandular injection of this cytokine alone or concomitantly with AM251 and AM630.
s
and AM630, injected separately or concomitantly, partially prevented LPS-induced inhibition of salivation. Also, anandamide synthase activity was increased in submandibular glands extracted from rats 3 h after LPS injection, suggesting that the endocannabinoid system was activated in response to this challenge. On the other hand, etanercept, prevented the inhibitory effect of LPS on salivary secretion and moreover, TNFα injected intraglandularly inhibited salivary secretion, being this effect prevented by AM251 and AM630 injected concomitantly.
sion
esent results demonstrate the participation of the endocannabinoid system and TNFα on salivary responses during systemic inflammation induced by LPS.

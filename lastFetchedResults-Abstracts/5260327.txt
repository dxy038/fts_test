In flight control, control allocation is used to distribute the total control command to each actuator when the number of actuators exceeds the number of controlled variables. A new optimal control allocation method based on nonlinear compensation was proposed in this paper. The quadratic term and mutual-interference effects were introduced into control effectiveness matrix. The linear combination of control objective and error objective was selected as optimal target. Then the optimal control allocation problem of redundancy system was solved by transformed to nonlinear programming formulation. Comparison with other allocation method and control system simulation results show the proposed method has timing properties similar to the redistributed pseudo-inverse method and achieves the objective accurately and optimally.

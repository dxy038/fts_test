The aim of the paper is to design an antenna suitable for wireless devices used in telemedicine, simulate and test its performance. To achieve this objective, a simpler, lighter, smaller sized fractal antenna is proposed. The antenna is designed on a FR4 substrate of size 36mm&#215;36mm&#215;1.6mm and is co-planar waveguide (CPW) fed. It resonates at three frequencies providing triple band operations in the S band. The simulation results on the fundamental antenna parameters such as return loss, gain, radiation pattern and VSWR meet the acceptable standards. Both the design and simulation have been carried out using IE3D electromagnetic simulation software. The experimental results of the fabricated antenna are also presented. The proposed antenna design is single-layered, via-free and can therefore be easily fabricated at a very low cost.

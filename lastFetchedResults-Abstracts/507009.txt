Salinity of soil and water is the most important agricultural hazard in arid and semi-arid
regions. In saline soils, yield production directly influences by soluble salts in the root zone as
well as by shallow water table depth. The first step for reclamation of such soils is reducing
salinity to optimum level by leaching. The objective of this study was to develop a practical
model to estimate water requirement for reclamation of saline-sodic soils at large scale based
on some obtainable soil physical characteristics. Consequently, a large area of 3,216 ha with
S4A3 salinity/sodicity class (extreme salinity and sodicity) was selected to obtain the required
data. Several mathematical models were applied to the collected data to verify their estimation
capability. The results indicated that at large scale, the proposed logarithmic model can provide
much better estimates for leaching process than the previously proposed models.

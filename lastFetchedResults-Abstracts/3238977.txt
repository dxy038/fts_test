A new differential evolution algorithm for single objective optimization is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm uses a self-adaptation mechanism for parameter control, divides its population into more subpopulations, applies more DE strategies, promotes population diversity, and eliminates the individuals that are not changed during some generations. The experimental results obtained by our algorithm on the benchmark consisting of 25 test functions with dimensions D = 10, D = 30, and D = 50 as provided for the CEC 2013 competition and special session on Real Parameter Single Objective Optimization are presented.

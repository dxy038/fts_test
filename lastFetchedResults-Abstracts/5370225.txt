MotionLab is an experimental system for the study of physical motion created as a learning objective of the Industrial Engineering students. MotionLab uses the accelerometers and the infrared camera of a game controller as a data acquisition interface present in the consumer electronics market. The aim of this system is to monitor and to study the results of physical experiments about solids motion under different conditions. This research line, aimed primarily at education, tries to build low-cost experimentation systems replacing the classic ones, which result, mostly, as less efficient and need more expensive laboratories.

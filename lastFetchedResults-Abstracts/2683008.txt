Background and Objective: According to definition of probiotics by WHO/FAO that is “Live microorganisms which, when present in sufficient amount, confer beneficial effects to the host”.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the first non-pathogenic yeast which is known as a probiotic for humans that its helpful effects for humankind has been proved. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most significant opportunistic pathogen that has notably resistance to many antibacterial agents. This study evaluated the effect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on the pathogenic factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa such as elastase, alkaline protease, and motility.

Materials and Methods: In this study, we used local strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has the probiotic property and Pseudomonas aeruginosa )PAO1 strain). In order to investigate the effect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (supernatant-lysate) on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, appropriate phenotypic tests were used.

Results: The extract of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from local strain has inhibitory effects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three factors involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenicity, which was studied in this research (elastase, alkaline protease, and motility), to the acceptable extent, controlled and inhibited.

Conclusion: According to results of this study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has reducing effects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which with more extensive research in this field, it can be used as a promising and innovative way to treat infection of this bacteria.

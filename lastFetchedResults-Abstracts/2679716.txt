Brand passion is increasingly seen as the ultimate emotional connection between a consumer ‎and a brand. Previous brand passion research is inadequate and the most of the studies consider the ‎brand passion as a one-dimension variable, but evidences of contention among these studies indicate that brand passion is not one-‎dimensional, but is rather a complex phenomenon that may include interrelated, yet distinct ‎components, resulting in different relationships with other variables. In this study, which based on ‎Sternberg theory of love and Swimberg study, a dual approach was applied to conceptualize brand ‎passion construct and harmonious brand passion and obsessive brand passion as two dimensions of it are considered. ‎Since previous studies of brand passion have one-dimensional view to drivers of it, in the present study two views, namely  consumer–brand link and ‎consumer–brand identity, were integrated to introduce antecedents of brand passion. According to these,‎the research model was introduced and tested. The statistical results have confirmed the model. In regard of objective, the research is a practical one, and according to the method, is descriptive-survey. The statistical population of the study is students of Tehran universities and sampling method is simple random.‎The model is tested by structural equations modeling, and statistical results of model and its fitness is verified. The results of consumer-brand identity view show that consumers who think brands have an effect on‎incremental growth of their identity, experience an increase in obsessive or harmonious brand passion. The results of consumer–brand ‎relationship view show that brand identification have a greater effect on the obsessive brand ‎passion

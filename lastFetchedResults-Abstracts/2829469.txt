To fulfil the objective of changing &#8220;accident handling, postmortem prevention&#8221; to &#8220;intrinsic safety, advance prevention&#8221; in chemical industry, this paper covers research to develop a process safety management system (PSMS). First of all, the method is proposed based on the survey, which pointed that it is an essential way to take full advantages of accidents information to enhance process safety management. Secondly, the key functions of PSMS are detailed and the needs for accident database are demanded. The defects of chemical database existing were concluded through literature review. Thirdly, the outline design of PSMS chemical accident database is presented. The work can provide some theoretical and practical reference for the study and development of the process safety management system.

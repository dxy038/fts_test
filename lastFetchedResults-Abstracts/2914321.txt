In the paper, a contour-oriented approach in the field of knowledge-based coding of videophone sequences is studied. It is believed that contours contain useful information in the knowledge-based coding paradigm. The authors concentrate on two problems in the knowledge-based approach: segmentation by contour extraction and contour motion estimation by contour matching in image sequences. For both problems algorithms have been developed which have been evaluated visually as well as in a more objective way. The results are discussed

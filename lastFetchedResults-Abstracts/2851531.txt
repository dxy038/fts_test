A pitch enhancement filter is designed with the objective to approach the optimal rate-distortion trade-off. The filter shows significant perceptual benefits, restating that information-theoretical and perceptual criteria are usually consistent. The filter is easy to implement and can be used as a complement to existing audio codecs. Our experiments show that it can improve the reconstruction quality of the AMR-WB standard.

Vehicle Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) rely on frequent data exchange among vehicles to facilitate road safety, congestion control, route planning, etc. The objective of this paper is to introduce an adaptive power control method based on propagation and traffic modeling. Dual-slope pathloss and shadowing model is used to describe the power propagation. Statistical tests performed on 50289 traces extracted from real highway data establish the traffic distributions for different times of the day. We also used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) for synthetically generating traces having statistical properties similar to those obtained from real data. Based on the adaptive transmission power method, the expected transmission power values for different times of the day are calculated and are compared with scenarios without power control, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

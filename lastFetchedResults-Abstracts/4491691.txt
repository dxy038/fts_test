This paper investigates robust fault detection problem for a class of discrete-time LPV systems with time-varying delays. Attention is focused on constructing the residual generator based on the filter whose parameters matrices depend on time-varying parameters, and formulating the design of fault detection filters as H<sub>infin</sub> filtering problem. The objective is to make the difference between the residual and the fault as small as possible, and enhance the robustness to control input, unknown input. Sufficient condition for the existence of the above filters is established by means of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed approach

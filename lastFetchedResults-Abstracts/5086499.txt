The control of a class of underactuated mechanical systems on Lie groups is addressed, with the objective of stabilizing, in a practical sense, any (possibly non-admissible) reference trajectory in the configuration space. The present control design method extends a previous result by the authors to systems underactuated by more than one control. For example, it allows to address the case of a 3D-rigid body immersed in a perfect fluid with only three control inputs. The choice of the control parameters is also discussed in relation to the systemÂ´s zero-dynamics

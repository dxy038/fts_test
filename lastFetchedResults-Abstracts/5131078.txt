In this paper, we propose a utility-based uplink dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithm for the IEEE 802.16j-enabled vehicular network. In the proposed DBA algorithm, a utility function, which considers characteristics of different types of service, is designed, and the utility of the total network is formulated. The objective of the proposed DBA algorithm is to allocate bandwidth to different types of service with quality of service (QoS) considered, by maximizing the utility of the overall network and further minimizing the average queuing delay of the overall system, with reasonable consideration to the required minimum bandwidth of different types of service, rtPS, nrtPS and BE. The solution to the problem of maximizing the utility of the total network is solved by using Lagrange multipliers with relaxed constraints. The simulation results have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DBA algorithm.

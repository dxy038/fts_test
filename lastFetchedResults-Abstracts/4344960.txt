This paper proposes a new heuristic approach to deal with discrete variables in an optimal power flow (OPF). This approach relies on the first order sensitivity of the objective and inequality constraints with respect to the discrete variables. The impact of a discrete variable change on the objective and inequality constraints is aggregated into a merit function. The proposed approach searches iteratively for better discrete variable settings as long as the problem solution can be improved. We provide numerical results with the proposed approach on four test systems up to 1203 buses and for the OPF problem of active power loss minimization.

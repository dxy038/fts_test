Objective. This study investigated the effect of heat treatment on the machinability of heat-treated cast gold alloy with age-hardenability at intraoral temperature using a handpiece engine with SiC wheels and an air-turbine handpiece with carbide burs and diamond points.

Methods. Cast gold alloy specimens underwent various heat treatments [As-cast (AC); Solution treatment (ST); High-temperature aging (HA), Intraoral aging (IA)] before machinability testing. The machinability test was conducted at a constant machining force of 0.784N. The three circumferential speeds used for the handpiece engine were 500, 1,000 and 1,500 m/min. The machinability index (M-index) was determined as the amount of metal removed by machining (volume loss, mm3). The results were analyzed by ANOVA and Scheff√©'s test.

Results. When an air-turbine handpiece was used, there was no difference in the M-index of the gold alloy among the heat treatments. The air-turbine carbide burs showed significantly (p<0.05) higher M-indexes than the diamond points after any heat treatments. With the SiC wheels, increasing the circumferencial speed increased the M-index values for each heat treatment. The specimens heat-treated with AC, HA and IA had similar M-indexes at the lower speeds (500 and 1,000 m/min). The ST specimens exhibited the lowest M-index at the lower speeds. However, at the highest speed (1,500 m/min), there were no significant differences in the M-indexes among the heat treatments except for HA, which showed the highest M-index.

Conclusion. There was no effect of heat treatment on the machinability of the gold alloy using the air-turbine handpiece. The heat treatments had a small effect on the M-index of the gold alloy machined with a SiC wheel for a handpiece engine.

We introduce a methodology for adaptive sequential sensing and processing in a classification setting. Our objective for sensor optimization is the back-end performance metric-in this case, misclassification rate. Our methodology, which we dub Integrated Sensing and Processing Decision Trees (ISPDT), optimizes adaptive sequential sensing for scenarios in which sensor and/or throughput constraints dictate that only a small subset of all measurable attributes can be measured at any one time. Our decision trees optimize misclassification rate by invoking a local dimensionality reduction-based partitioning metric in the early stages, focusing on classification only in the leaves of the tree. We present the ISPDT methodology and illustrative theoretical, simulation, and experimental results.

Objective to determine the sensitivity and specificity of cardinal sign's of scleral rupture after ocular blunt trauma.

Background trauma is one of the most important causes of ocular morbidity , and has been reported 1.4% to 5.6% of the prevalence of scleral rupture after ocular blunt trauma . The scleral rupture may be occult after ocular blunt trauma with subconjunctival hemorrhage and intraocular hemorrhage .

Methods records of all patients with ocular blunt trauma who had undergone diagnostic peritomy surgery for scleral laceration were retrospectively reviewed. The eyes were categorized into two groups: 1, positive peritomy (scleral laceration) and 2: negative peritomy , then the recods were evaluated. Results with respect to clinical features , 73 patients (81.8% male , 19.2% female) had went disgnostic peritomy surgery. Patients'age ranged from 8 months to 65 years. Overall diagnostic peritomy was positive in 28.76% and negetive in 71.24% . The signs in positive peritomy group includes decreased visual acuity in 80.9% , intraocular pressure 6 mm/Hg in 66.6% , limitation of ocular motility in 28.5% , APD (Afferent pupillary defect) in 57.1% , sub conjuctival hemorrhage and chemosis in 80.9% , hyphema in 95.2% , depth of anterier chamber change in 76.1% and not visible of fundus in 90.4% .

Overall , the scleral laceration may be occurred after blunt truma . Therefore the patients show Cardinal sign's after ocular blunt trauma may need diagnostic peritomy surgery.

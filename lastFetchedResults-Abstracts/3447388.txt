The results of the initial deployment of a wideband (40-4000 Hz) vertical acoustic antenna system in the Tongue of the Ocean, the Bahamas are discussed. The instrumentation system consisted of seven octavely nested, four-wavelength linear apertures covering the above frequency range, and a VCR-based subsurface recording system that carried out a programmed sequence of recordings. The objective of the measurement system is the development of a database of directional spectra obtained in an acoustically isolated area where the ambient is principally controlled by the local (observable) sea-surface conditions. The purpose of the database is to identify a model of the space-time statistics of the acoustic ambient caused by sea-surface sound

In order to design reasonable guidance and control systems for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),which will be used as a platform to do the flight test to confirm the thought that was attacking the target with bank-to-turn (BTT) maneuvering in the terminal phase. To obtain the control model of this UAV, the flight test experiment designed for identification was done firstly. Using the least square method to deal with the acquired flight test data, the mathematical model of the UAV was obtained. This model was accurate and reliable for the correlation of the simulation results based on this model with the flight test results was quite good .Then on the basis of this control model, the guidance and control systems were designed for this UAV. The result of flight simulation shows the designed systems can satisfactorily reach the expected objective.

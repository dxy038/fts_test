Heavy metals are one of the concerned pollutants emitted by the municipal waste incineration system (MWIs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential impact on local airborne metals from the emissions of an MWI. Aerosol samples were simultaneously collected at eight different sites around the municipal waste incinerator using PS-1 sampler. The concentrations of 16 elements (Mg, Al, Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, As, Cd, Ba and Hg) were quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICPâ€“MS) and atomic absorption spectrometer (AA). The profiles of the 16 metals in the surroundings of a municipal incinerator in central Taiwan were compared with those of the emission sources. The results showed that the profiles of multiple metals obtained at all sampling sites were similar to those emitted from the MWI stack. These findings suggested that the local airborne metal pollutants might probably derive from the stack emission of the MWI. Using cadmium as an index metal, it was found that the metals like Mg, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, As, and Hg are highly influenced by the stack emission from the municipal incinerator. Moreover, the ratio of other metals to Cd that were increased with the distance from the incinerator. This might be due to the additional sources contributed to airborne metals following the emission from the incinerator and a difference in particle size of each particle-bound metal.

Objective.  To recognize and quantify the influence of biomechanical factors, namely anthropometry and foot placement, on the more common measures of stabilometric performance, including new-generation stochastic parameters.

Design. Fifty normal-bodied young adults were selected in order to cover a sufficiently wide range of anthropometric properties. They were allowed to choose their preferred side-by-side foot position and their quiet stance was recorded with eyes open and closed by a force platform.

Background. biomechanical factors are known to influence postural stability but their impact on stabilometric parameters has not been extensively explored yet.

Methods. Principal component analysis was used for feature selection among several biomechanical factors. A collection of 55 stabilometric parameters from the literature was estimated from the center-of-pressure time series. Linear relations between stabilometric parameters and selected biomechanical factors were investigated by robust regression techniques.

Results. The feature selection process returned height, weight, maximum foot width, base-of-support area, and foot opening angle as the relevant biomechanical variables. Only eleven out of the 55 stabilometric parameters were completely immune from a linear dependence on these variables. The remaining parameters showed a moderate to high dependence that was strengthened upon eye closure. For these parameters, a normalization procedure was proposed, to remove what can well be considered, in clinical investigations, a spurious source of between-subject variability.

Conclusion. Care should be taken when quantifying postural sway through stabilometric parameters. It is suggested as a good practice to include some anthropometric measurements in the experimental protocol, and to standardize or trace foot position.

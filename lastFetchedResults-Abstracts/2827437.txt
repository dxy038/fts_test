For the sake of developing an energy efficient railway balise, choosing an efficient energy modulation is very important. The main objective of this paper is to propose a complete analytical model to compare the energy efficiency of two well-known UWB modulations in Nakagami-m fading channel with path-loss. The results show that M-ary PPM is more efficient than M-ary PAM for high constellations, high communication ranges and high path-loss values. It also shows that, as we increase the number of receiver branches, the communication system becomes less energy consuming.

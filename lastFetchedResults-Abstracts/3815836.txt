Decoupled model based algorithms have been widely used to solve the optimal reactive dispatch problem. However, in the presence of nonnegligible active-reactive coupling, convergence and solution reliability problems may appear. This paper presents the implementation of an algorithm based on the estimation of active power related Lagrange multipliers to solve the optimal reactive dispatch. The estimation process is based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions. Adequate treatment of nonseparable objective functions and numerical results carried out on test-cases (17 buses) and real-life networks (329 and 447 buses) are reported

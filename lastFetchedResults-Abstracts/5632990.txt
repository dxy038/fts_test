The main objective of this paper is to enhance the availability of composite real-time multimedia Web services through load balanced redundant Web Services. The composite real-time multimedia Web service (CRMWS) allows the services to be automatically composed from components of distributed Web services, detecting faults and providing alternate services based on Service Level Agreements (SLA). The reliability of CRMWS is increased by providing quick alternate Web Services through NOT-Shift-AND parallel search algorithm that searches for the availability of Web service in the Web Service Map (WSM). The proposed system architecture for implementing CRMWS for Video-on-Demand shows the effectiveness of these mechanisms that enhance the availability of CRMWS.

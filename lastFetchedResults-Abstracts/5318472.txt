During last decades, the environment has undergone serious changes from EM point of view. The objective of this paper is to analyze realistic exposure scenarios by means of numerical computations. Our aim is to determine peak values of SAR and temperature rise for various frequencies and antenna lengths. This paper contains results of computer simulations performed on a human model.

The objective of this work is to show the operation of a system that allows monitoring, controlling and configuring a wireless household-electric network. The user interface of this system is done through a personal digital assistant (PDA). Initially, the wireless communication was established by the Bluetooth protocol. It was used a hardware module which provided the communication between the PDA and the microcontroller embedded in the household-electric. In the next step, it will be implemented modifications in the hardware and firmware of the appliance, to implement functions using a microcontroller with integrated ZigBee protocol. In the implementation of the user interface, it is being used the JAVA programming language, which allows the portability of the interface to the Palm, windows and symbian operational systems used in PDAs and smartphones.

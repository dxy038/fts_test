The main aim of this study is to carry out a socio-linguistic analysis of definitions adopted in online glossaries for the conceptualisation of immigrant integration and closely related terms with regard to processes (integration, migration, immigration) and actors (host society, migrant, immigrant). Migration to a country changes the size and the composition of the receiving country or society raising problems of adaptation between the citizens of the host country and the newcomers in operationalising processes of acceptance of migrants with a view to creating and maintaining forms of immigrant integration. In order to be successful, enhancing bilateral adaptation should be a primary objective at institutional level. On the one hand, the newcomers have to adapt to the indigenous population and the institutions of the host society, on the other hand, the host society and its institutions have to give opportunities to the newcomers to co-act and co-construct ways of living together. In light of this, studies of immigrant integration have produced a number of different terms, like “absorption, adaptation, race relations cycle, assimilation, acculturation, inclusion, incorporation (…) ‘integration’” (Bosswick & Heckmann 2006, p. 2). The terms under scrutiny in the present paper are analysed in definitions adopted in online glossaries (namely EU and IOM) in an attempt to shed light on the role of definitions as elements in argumentation (cf. Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, (1958) 1966) and social transformation as a set of moves in “re-scaling” the discourse of immigrant integration (cf. Fairclough 2007). Some vagueness in language resulted from ideological implications in definitions and calls for redefinition in view of clarity of intent towards acceptance and respect for a more effective cooperation and inclusion among institutions and social actors.

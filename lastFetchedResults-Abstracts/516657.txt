Although several plants and procedures for treatment of kidney stone disease
in Iranian folk medicine, Urolithiasis has been an important problem for patients, yet.
Objective: Aim of present study, was the investigation of effect of Cucumis melo fruit skin
hydro-alcoholic extract on calcium oxalate crystallization was studied in vitro.
Methods: At first, hydro-alcoholic extract of plant at doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/ml
were prepared. Urine samples were collectedfrom 6 individual men without kidney stone
history. The urine samples were centrifuged. Calcium oxalate crystallization was induced by
adding sodium oxalate to urine samples. Then, number and size of calcium oxalate crystals
were measured by spectrophotometer and calibration of ocular lens of light microscope in
control (without plant extract) and experimental (in presence of different of doses plant
extract) groups, respectively.
Results: Different doses of hydro-alcoholic extract of plant increased percent of small
crystals (2.5-5 and 6-9 μ), while decreased percent of big crystals (17-21, 22-30 and 31-40 μ in
comparison to control samples. On the other hand, the plant increasedmono-hydrate calcium
oxalate crystals in comparison to di-hydrate calcium oxalate crystals. Also, the extract
increased number of calcium oxalate crystals.
Conclusion: Present results showed that hydro-alcoholic extract of Cucumis melo fruit skin
could facilitate kidney stones excretion by decreasing size of crystals. So, itcould prevent
formation of kidney stone primary nucleus.

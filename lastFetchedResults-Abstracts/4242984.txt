The actual three dimensional radar purposes are to detect the target in three dimensions range, height and azimuth angle. The objective target for this paper is to simulate and study the three dimensional 3 D radar pencil volume coverage and the evaluation of the 3 D detection map contours (DMC) in complex environment. Also, the 3D DMC and 3D volume coverage are examined for different polarizations, such as horizontal, vertical, and circular. The results show that greater DMC and volume coverage are obtained in case of using horizontal polarization than the vertical and circular polarizations, also the vertical polarization produces greater ranges and greater DMC than the circular polarization assuming that the same radar parameters and same environment for the two cases, the free space and interference conditions. Also the accuracy measurements for the elevation and azimuth angles are better when using the Pencil beam coverage. The applications of the 3D (PBR) are widely used and interested for ATC radars and the EWR for homeland defense and protection because they are offering the prediction of radar performance and radar sitting. The detection and tracking facilities are obtained simultaneously which improve the target processing time and minimizing the cost.

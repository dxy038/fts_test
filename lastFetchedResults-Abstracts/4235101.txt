There is expected to be a large penetration of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) into the market in the near future. As a result, many technical problems related to the impact of this technology on the power grid need to be addressed. The anticipating large penetration of PHEV into our societies will add a substantial energy load to power grids, as well as add substantial energy resources that can be utilized. There is also a need for in-depth study on PHEVs in term of Smart Grid environment. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for optimally managing a large number of PHEVs (i.e., 500) charging at a municipal parking station. We used Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to intelligently allocate energy to the PHEVs. We considered constraints such as energy price, remaining battery capacity, and remaining charging time. A mathematical framework for the objective function (i.e., maximizing the average State-of-Charge at the next time step) is also given. We characterized the performance of our PSO algorithm using a MATLAB simulation, and compared it with other techniques.

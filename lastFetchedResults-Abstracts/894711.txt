This paper investigates optimization methods based on Genetic Algorithms
(GAs) for spiral heat exchangers. The purpose of designing heat exchanger depends on its
application and could be total cost, heat transfer coecient or both of them. The current
targeting methods identify optimum points from both economic and thermodynamic views,
and capture a trade-o between two objectives. Optimizations, using single objective
functions, are performed in order to investigate parameter behavior in two dierent
applications of SHEs. Also, this work takes care of numerous geometric parameters in the
presence of logical constraints. Multi-objective and weighted function optimizations, using
genetic algorithm, are developed in order to obtain a set of geometric design parameters,
which lead to minimum pressure drop and the maximum overall heat transfer coecient.
Optimized heat transfer coecient, compared to its rst value at basic design, had a 13%
increase, and total cost in optimized case presents 50% reduction compared to the basic
design. Also in trade-o cases, heat transfer coecient and total cost have been improved
up to 60% increment and 20% reduction, respectively. Therefore, designing heat exchanger,
using presented optimal methods in this research, are proposed as useful methods for
designers, engineers and researchers.

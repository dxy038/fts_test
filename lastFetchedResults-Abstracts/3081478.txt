Inter-AS outbound Traffic Engineering (TE) aims to control the flow of traffic exiting an AS so as to optimize inter-AS TE objectives such as load balancing among multiple downstream ASes. The inter-AS traffic matrix is fundamental input for outbound TE and its accuracy is essential for the target performance to be achieved. However, deriving an accurate traffic matrix is far from trivial. This paper proposes a robust approach for outbound TE to manage traffic demand uncertainty through Scenario-based Robust Optimization. The objective of this robust outbound TE is to minimize the worst-case maximum inter-AS link utilization across a set of inter-AS traffic matrices while minimizing the performance deviation from the optimal solutions. Simulation results reveal that the robust outbound TE is capable of achieving reasonably good performance under all the given traffic matrices while non-robust approaches are not.

Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate oesophagogastroduedensocopy (OGD) findings in patients presenting with dyspepsia.Material and Methods: This retrospective, observational study was conducted in Medical "C" unit, Department of Medicine Post Graduate Medical Institute Government Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar from August 2002 to September 2005. Adult patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies for dyspepsia during the period were included in the study. The endoscopies were performed as per the standard protocol with diagnosis based on accepted criteria.Results: A total of 765 patients with dyspepsia had endoscopy. Amongst them 49.8 % (n=381) were female and 50.2 % (n=384) male. The mean age of the study population was 39.43 years (SD+17.46). A single endoscopic diagnosis was made in 57.2%> (n=438) of the studied patients. In 12.8% (n=98) combinations of lesions were seen. Gastritis (13.85%, n=106), oesophagitis (11.1% n=85), duodenal ulcer (8.1%, n=62), hiatus hernia (7.32%,, n=56), duodenitis (7%, n=54%0) and gastric ulcer (3.4%0, n=26) were the common finding on endoscopy. Duodenal ulcer was more common as compared to gastric ulcer (8.1% vs. 3.4%). Endoscopy was normal in 30% (n=229) of patients. These patients apparently had functional dyspepsia.Conclusion: Gastro-duodenitis, oesophagitis, peptic ulcer disease and hiatus hernia are the commonest endoscopic diagnosis in patients with dyspepsia. Upper GI endoscopy is a useful diagnostic modality in elucidation of the causes of dyspepsia.

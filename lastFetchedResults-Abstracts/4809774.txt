The objective of this study is to characterize the process of extracting digital elevation models from ARGUS video images and remote sensing techniques. Using principal components analysis, the record of images into a UTM coordinate system, together with the acquisition of image parameters it was possible to extract altimetry from a 2D image to generate a 3D image. The use of data collected on site and the use of polynomial linear regression models it was possible to calibrate the 3D images in a way to better represent altimetry with great accuracy. In this context, the video monitoring system with 3D view turns out to be an important low cost tool to monitor coastal environments, allowing the analysis of vertical changes and thus permitting a better understanding of beach morphodynamics for the coastal managers.

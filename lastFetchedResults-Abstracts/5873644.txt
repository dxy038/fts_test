The dynamic formulation is presented in this paper. On base of a method which refers to the principle of virtual work, the inverse dynamic model of the 2-DOF parallel platform is set up. The dynamic formulation is a system of equations including two equations and three unknown quantities referring to three driving forces. Therefore, the solution of the driving forces as to the system of equations is carried out by employing the generalized inverse matrix with minimizing an objective function which is the square of the sum of three driving forces.

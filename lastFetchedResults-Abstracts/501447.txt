Objective: To record the prevalence of overweight and obesity in urban primaryschool
children in relation to several socio-economic and demographic factors.
Design: Cross-sectional.
Setting/subjects: A representative sample of 729 schoolchildren (379 male and
350 female), aged 9–13 years, stratified by parental educational level, was examined
in the urban region of Athens. Weight and height were measured using
standard procedures. The International Obesity Task Force thresholds were used
for the definition of overweight and obesity. Several socio-economic and demographic
data and the child’s ‘popularity’ score were also recorded with specifically
designed standardized questionnaires.
Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 29?6% and 11?1%,
respectively. Annual family income of h12 000–20 000 (OR51?58), residence
ownership (OR51?63) and the grandmother as the child’s primary caregiver
(OR51?38) were significantly associated with higher odds of childhood overweight
and obesity. Non-Greek parental nationality (OR50?72) and higher
‘popularity’ scores of children (OR50?42) were significantly associated with lower
odds of overweight and obesity. The grandmother as the child’s primary caregiver
and an annual family income of h12 000–20 000 remained significantly associated
with childhood overweight and obesity after adding all significant correlates of
childhood overweight and obesity observed at the bivariate level in a multivariate
regression model (OR51?51 and 1?61, respectively).
Conclusions: Among family income, residence ownership, child’s primary caregiver,
parental nationality and popularity scores that were identified as significant
correlates of childhood overweight and obesity at the bivariate level, lower family
income and grandmother as the child’s primary caregiver were the only factors that
remained significantly associated with childhood overweight and obesity at a
multivariate level.

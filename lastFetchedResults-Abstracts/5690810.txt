The objective of the present study is an experimental research on current commercial magnetrons and a development on low-noise magnetrons for solar power station/satellite. Turning off the filament current of a magnetron works exceedingly well for improving the generation of spurious noises as well as the oscillation bandwidth when it is driven by DC stabilized power supply. We have experimentally verified that these improvements are produced by the smoothing effect of the anode current, the reduction of the thermal effects, and the damping of the electrons in the vicinity of both filament ends.

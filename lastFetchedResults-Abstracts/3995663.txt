Three different control algorithms, traditional single-phase-shift control, dual-phase-shift control (DPSC), and model-based phase-shift control (MPSC), are implemented in a hardware setup and compared for a full-bridge-based isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter. The differences among their dynamic performance and steady-state operations are quantitatively analyzed. Experimental results showed good agreement with theoretical analysis. MPSC showed the best dynamic performance, while DPSC can eliminate reactive power under light-load conditions.

This paper intends to establish a method to measure the performance of telecenters from the perspective of social sustainability. Social sustainability, one of the driving forces of telecenter sustainability, can be achieved when telecenter is able to deliver community acceptance content to majority of the local population. In addition to content design, telecenters have to be efficient in their operation by minimizing the resource while maximizing the outcome. Following formative assessment approach that focuses on monitoring the progress or outcome (efficiency) of the project, and within the objective of finding a set of best performance telecenters, this study employs Data Envelopment Analysis to periodically evaluate the operation of 20 telecenters of iREACH telecenter network.

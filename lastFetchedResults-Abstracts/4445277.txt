A simulation optimization method is proposed to realize the optimal planning on the dispatching of emergency materials. Firstly, the formulation of mathematical programming model considering reverse logistics is established, and the optimal objective is to minimize the cost of the emergency system and ensure to satisfy the time constraint of the demand points in the disaster areas. Secondly, the emergency materials dispatching simulation model is built using the object-oriented method. At last, the simulation optimization method integrating the simulation model and the genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of emergency materials dispatching, and the effectiveness and efficiency are verified and analyzed through an actual example. The result shows its feasibility for the emergency materials optimal dispatching.

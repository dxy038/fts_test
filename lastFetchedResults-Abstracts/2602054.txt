The discussion of ideational grammatical metaphor has been attracted the attention of many researchers because of its usefulness and effectiveness in packaging information. With the device, meaning expressed in one pattern of the grammar can be reconstructed in another pattern of the grammar. This study focuses on the sequence type of ideational grammatical metaphor, which is then termed the sequence of ideational grammatical metaphor. In this kind of metaphor, the realization of meaning in clause complex is packed into a single clause through some wording techniques. The main objective of the present study is to analyze the application of techniques and their functions in historical text. By using the main framework of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) proposed by Halliday and Matthiessen (2004), it is concluded that two main techniques, with expansion and with projection, are used to construe two different features of information in historical text. Both expansion and projection wording technique pack the realization of features in clause complex into a single metaphorical clause.

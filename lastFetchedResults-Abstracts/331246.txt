Objectives
The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the direct transmittance of the micro-hybrid composite resins Charisma F, Solitaire II, Intens and Tetric Ceram, and the nanofilled composite resins Exthet-X and Filtek Supreme in the dentin and translucent shades.
Methods

Three samples of each composite resin and shade were obtained with dimensions of 12 mm × 12 mm and 1 mm thick. After light activation, three measurements for each sample were done with an UV–vis spectrophotometer. The spectra was analyzed by mean values for the percentage of direct transmittance at intervals of 20 nm in the range between 400 and 700 nm (%T) and the percentage of direct transmittance in the wavelengths of 400, 560 and 700 nm (Td).
Results

The Student's t-test showed that dentin shade of Charisma F had significant higher %T than the translucent shade. For Solitaire II, Intens, Tetric Ceram and Esthet-X the translucent shade had higher %T than the dentin shade. For Filtek Supreme there was no statistical difference between the dentin and translucent shades. According to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey multiple-range test Charisma F had the highest %T and Td at dentin and translucent shades, except for translucent shade at 700 nm, in which Esthet-X had higher Td.
Significance

This study indicates that the percentage of direct transmittance is not directly related with the composite resin shade.

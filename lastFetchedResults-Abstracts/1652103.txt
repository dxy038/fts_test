In the design of high load bearing elements made of tempered flat glass, connections cannot be avoided when large spans or high stiffness beams are considered. This paper investigates bolted connections in glass structures; the main objective is to determine the optimal joint. This work is performed through the determination of stress states due to both thermal tempering and in-plane loading. The modeling of the thermal tempering is performed with the FE software Abaqus and additional user subroutines. Experiments on industrial tempering line with specific set-up allow the determination of the air flow in the hole and then of the forced convection coefficients. The radiative heat transfer is also modeled numerically and the semi-transparency of glass in the near infrared is considered. In order to calculate residual stresses, the visco-elasticity of glass and the structural relaxation phenomena are taken into account. The computed stresses are checked against photo-elastic measurements. As various holes are considered, this study allows to determine the hole geometry for which the tempering process is the most effective. For the study of the consequences of in-plane loading, a large experimental campaign has been performed. The studied connection is derived from countersunk supports. The influences of different parameters as the hole geometry, the nature of the washer between glass and metallic connector as well as the glass-washer material friction coefficient were investigated. The modeling of these tests is performed with the FE software Abaqus. This modeling takes into account the ductility of the materials, the friction and the clearances between the parts. This modeling is validated thanks to failure stress measurements. The combination of modeling and experiments leads to identify optimal connection.

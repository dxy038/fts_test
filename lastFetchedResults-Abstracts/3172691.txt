This paper proposed a new heuristic, named SDH heuristic, for solving the no-wait flow shop scheduling problem with the objective to minimize total flowtime. The SDH heuristic is based on the well-known NEH heuristic Firstly, the total flowtime is shown. Secondly, the SDH heuristic is presented. Thirdly, Extensive computational experiments are carried out based on a set of well-known benchmark instances. Computational results and comparison show the effectiveness of the DHS heuristic in solving the no-wait flow shop scheduling with total flowtime criterion.

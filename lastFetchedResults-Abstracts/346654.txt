Objective: The aim of this study was to examine cortical correlates of semantic memory processes in the auditory stimulus modality.
Methods: Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) of the lower (8–10 Hz) and upper (10–12 Hz) alpha frequency bands of background EEG were studied in 10 subjects performing an auditory semantic matching task. The stimuli were abstract and concrete nouns which were presented sequentially in pairs. The task was to decide whether the two nouns belonged to the same semantic category or not.
Results: The presentation of the first stimulus (encoding) elicited ERS whereas the presentation of the second stimulus (semantic matching) elicited ERD. Abstract nouns presented as the second stimulus elicited ERD which was most prominent in the lower alpha frequency band, whereas the presentation of a concrete noun as the first stimulus elicited ERS, most prominently in the upper alpha frequency band.
Conclusions: The auditorily elicited ERD/ERS reflects cortical activity associated with cognitive functions. The present findings demonstrate that the auditorily elicited ERD/ERS can reveal subtle differences in auditory information processing. Semantic memory processes (encoding and comparison) are reflected as varying responses in the two alpha frequency bands.

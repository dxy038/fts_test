In bridge engineering the following forms of structure geometry representation are typically applied: non-dimensional models preferred in the Bridge Management Systems and one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) models used in structural analysis. Classification proposed in this paper is more precise and takes into account both the type of model elements and the size of space used for model creation. Proposed taxonomy of the geometrical models and presented notation of the distinguished classes enable consistent and uniform classification as well as objective comparison of all models which can be applied in bridge engineering, both in the Bridge Management Systems and in structural analysis of bridges.

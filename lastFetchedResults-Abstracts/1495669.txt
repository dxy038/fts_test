Materials and Methods: The present research is conducted in the form of a semi-experimental study including a control group. We sampled 38 available female patients with GERD who were diagnosed by the specialists and received medical treatment; then, we randomly divided them into two groups – experimental and control. The patients responded to the Quality of life Questionnaire in Gastroesophageal Reflux] REFLUX-QUAL] at two stages: as a pretest –before implementing a group stress management training that included two stages of informing and training – and as a posttest – after the psychological intervention. We analyzed the resulting data using a one-way analysis of covariance.
Results: Stress management training improves the Global Quality of Life (p= 0.01), and four of its dimensions including Daily Life (p= 0.02), Quality of Life (p= 0.02), State of Mind (p= 0.05) and Worries and Concerns (p= 0.04) in patients with GERD, but did not significantly influence the other dimensions; Relationships, Sleep, and Food.

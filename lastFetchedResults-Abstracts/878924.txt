This paper extends the full convergence of the steepest descent method with a generalized Armijo search and a proximal regularization
to solve minimization problems with quasiconvex objective functions on complete Riemannian manifolds. Previous
convergence results are obtained as particular cases and some examples in non-Euclidian spaces are given. In particular, our approach
can be used to solve constrained minimization problems with nonconvex objective functions in Euclidian spaces if the set
of constraints is a Riemannian manifold and the objective function is quasiconvex in this manifold.

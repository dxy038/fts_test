An integral bulk shield experiment has been performed at the Frascati Neutron Generator (FNG) with the main objective to validate the ITER shielding system. To this end, a suitable mock-up of the ITER inboard shielding system including first wall, shielding blanket, vacuum vessel and toroidal field coil, had been assembled at ENEA Frascati. Neutron and γ-ray spectra as well as various nuclear responses were measured inside this mock-up when irradiated by 14-MeV neutrons. Measured and calculated data were compared to validate transport codes and nuclear data used in the design of the ITER system. In particular, the measured neutron and γ-spectra, reaction rates and the nuclear heating were compared with the same quantities calculated with the MCNP Monte Carlo code using the Fusion Evaluated Nuclear Data Library (FENDL)-1.0 and the European Fusion File (EFF)-3.0 neutron cross section data. The neutron-induced activation measured in stainless steel was compared with calculations performed with the FISPACT code and using the most recent activation cross section data file FENDL/A-2.0. The paper includes a comparison of calculated over measured quantities (C/E) and a discussion of their relevance to the ITER nuclear design. It is found that, generally, the measured nuclear quantities are predicted by FENDL-1.0 and EFF-3.0 calculations within an uncertainty margin of about ±15% in the shielding blanket and vacuum vessel, and ±30% up to the region of the toroidal field coil.
